Crichton's period heist film is quite exciting...
'The First Great Train Robbery' is about a quite impossible mission in Victorian underworld... It is about gold bars placed in strongboxes and taken by armed security guards to the railway station...
'The First Great Train Robbery' is about four keys separately kept and guarded by different parties... and a daring gentleman thief who never tells the truth...
'The First Great Train Robbery' is about a bunch of crooks that can steal your heart... and is about a young stunning mistress who suspects that her father breaks his own regulation for each morning of the shipments...
'The First Great Train Robbery' is about the fastest pickpocket you'll ever see...
The film chronicles the grandeur and hypocrisy at all levels of England during the Victorian Era, and proves that the cleverness and prowess of a criminal mastermind is elevated to heroic status...
With excellent photography of Ireland beautiful countryside, and great music score by Jerry Goldsmith, Michael Crichton's period heist film is quite exciting... The movie gave American's audience a pleasure to escape from the outcome of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal...

Almost as good as the book!
I read Michael Crichton's book a few years ago, and I loved it, but I did not see the movie version until recently. Then I read Crichton's book "Travels," which has a chapter on the filming of the movie, which he directed. With my interest now piqued, I got the movie CD and enjoyed it very much, especially after reading Crichton's account of the problems during filming. Filmed in 1978, this is Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland at their finest, playing two Victorian scalawags trying to pull off the biggest heist in British history. To say any more about the outcome would be a spoiler, but the movie is almost two hours of nonstop intrigue and tension as the two crooks try to figure how to steal the unstealable.
With Crichton writing the screenplay and directing, the movie was pretty faithful to the book, although if you want all the little details, read the book also. This was based on an actual event, but I don't know how faithful Crichton's story is to the real event. In any case, the movie does a great job of recreating mid-nineteenth century London and the sights and sounds of the period, even to the old steam locomotive used.
Except for one brief, harmless scene in a London bordello, this is a great family movie.
Highly recommended for two hours of entertainment! ...more info
Nice Period Piece For A Heist Flick; Needs A Blu-Ray Transfer
Wow, this is a wonderfully-filmed movie that especially looked good since it was one of the first DVDs I purchased over a decade ago. Rich colors and good period detail of 19th century England made it visually attractive. However, compared to most DVDs, the transfer here was too grainy. I hope MGM re-issues this on Bllu-Ray and gives it the sharp transfer it deserves.
Story-wise, beware that it takes quite awhile before the actual holdup takes place. This is almost a two-hour film and they build up slowly to famous heist. However, I didn't find any of it boring. This is rated PG but there are quite of bit of sexual innuendos early on by Connery as he woos Lesley-Ane Down. Other than that, it's a pretty tame film. Donald Sutherland adds a touch a touch of humor here and there as he and Connery pull off the suspenseful heist....and it is suspenseful.
Connery trying to maneuver on top of the train was a highlight, as was the "whooshing" sound of the train each time it passed under a bridge. The stereo in here is very good for a film almost 30 years old.

On track
With great actors and a great plot this movie is a real charmer.
After reading the book I was pleased to see that the movie actually
follows the book much better than many others I have seen. There is
a bit of uneveness in the movie but it is still a great watch....more info
An adventure for all Connery fans...
Based on actual fact and the novel by Michael Crichton (who also directed it), this a very tense and humorous adventure-thriller set in Victorian times during the Crimean War.
Sean Connery, Donald Sutherland and Lesley-Anne Down form a fantastic trio of robbers, train robbers that is, with style and panache.
Through a lot of planning, plotting and training, we are immersed in this amazing adventure and introduced in the underground world of Victorian crime life.
The entire subject is treated with a good dose of British humor and outmost taste and respect for historic detail.
The DVD sports a very good image transfer and the 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack (English track only, French is in Mono) is well balanced, although the music (by Jerry Goldsmith), which is masterfully rendered, sometimes blasts off and tends to cover some of the more subtler portions of dialogue (but this only happens a couple of times, so nothing to really worry about).
The entire movie is as fresh and entertaining as the first time it appeared in movie theaters.
I can highly recommend it....more info
Robbery Deluxe
Sean Connery and Donald Southerland are very good in this movie based on the Michael Crichton novel. The scenes and costuming are magnificent, and the characteristics of the storyline ingenious and clever. Great writing, great acting and great viewing. ...more info
A Costume Crime Story
The film tells how ¡ê25,000 in gold was shipped to pay British troops during the Crimean War in 1855. One man is found on the train, there is a fight, and he is thrown off. One "sharp business man" is very interested in these gold shipments. (Gold is untraceable.) Edward Pierce plans to steal the gold shipment and makes meticulous plans to steal and copy the four keys to the safe. This film shows the "ratting" sport, and people riding horses. It shows how each key is found and copied by different ruses. Mid 19th century London was recreated as the background. "All everybody thinks about is money." There is a security leak and new precautions are taken. Edward Pierce has a way to defeat those plans. "Social engineering" has a long history.
This film shows how this theft is accomplished. There is a glitch (no plan is perfect) but it is overcome. Yet there is a final slip-up. The judge sentences Pierce. But one last trick trumps justice at the end. [Do you find it believable?] Does this remind you of "The Sting"?
One problem is the shipment of gold in bullion rather than in coins.

Great Train Robbery
This was by far one of the best heist movies I've seen in a long time. Don Sutherland and Sean Connery were as entertaining as ever. The plot kept me on the edge of my seat throughout....more info

Reasonably Entertaining
In 1855, England was near the height of its power. Industrialization had transformed the country, its empire stretched across most of the world, and high-speed rail was an established fact of life. In the midst of this Victorian order, Edward Pierce conceived and executed perhaps the most daring robbery up to that point in time. Specifically, he and his confederates set out to steal 25,000 pounds in gold bullion from a moving train protected by every form of security available in that age.
This is something of a pet project for Michael Crichton. First he wrote the novel, The Great Train Robbery, and then he wrote and directed this adaptation. As one might expect, the movie largely stays true to the book except for some trimming to help keep the film from running too long. The tone is fairly tongue-in-cheek and the plot moves along at a good pace.
The cast is largely populated with unknowns, though there are two obvious exceptions. Sean Connery takes center stage as Pierce and does an adequate, though highly understated, job of filling the role. Donald Sutherland plays his primary aide, Agar, and gives the part with a suitable touch of goofiness without going overboard. The no-names all do creditably jobs of filling their roles but none stand out.
Those who love a good heist should enjoy The Great Train Robbery. Some of the intricacy is lost in the translation to film, but it's still very solid. One complaint is that there is a fair amount of 19th century slang and criminal jargon that can be tough to follow and is never explained or translated for 21st century viewers. It also seemed to me that Crichton might not have been the best director for this movie. It's very "by the numbers" and lacks any real verve. When you look at the plot, I see no reason why this couldn't be every bit as enjoyable as The Sting, but it's not even in the same league. There isn't enough sense of fun, and more emphasis on the intricacy of the planning would have made the crime seem more impressive.
This is not a bad movie, and worth giving a try if you enjoy heists. Sean Connery doesn't give his most memorable performance, but his many fans should enjoy seeing him play the rogue. As long as you watch this with measured expectations, it's a pleasant way to spend two hours....more info
Wonderful mixture of comedy, suspense, and drama
This movie is taken from a book by Michael Crichton. I love that author, but have never been able to read the book. So, I ordered the movie! It's great! The comment is made that this is the story of the first train robbery ever - like EVER - in history.
Each character is unique. There is subterfuge here too.
The ending is just wonderful! Sure to satisfy everybody....more info
Easier to understand if you already read the book.
Pretty good dramatization of the book. It was far easier to watch the story as a movie than to get through the Victorian language and style of the book!...more info

Universal Slime 4
Grace Fenlason October 27, 2016
Universal Slime, the outrageous, beautiful, and wild zine created by John F. Malta, started as copies run off of a Xerox machine at the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 2012. Four years later John is about to release the fourth installment of the annual comics, illustration, and art anthology, with artists like Kristen Liu-Wong, Josh Freydkis, Siobhán Gallagher, Homeless Cop and John himself contributing to the colorful and incredibly curated zine.
John’s own work is a mad and rad adventure into the short narratives of his beady-eyed and brightly-colored characters. Bold lines and psychedelic backdrops further help convey the scenarios and characters that Malta injects with his own imaginative tales, personal memories, and definitive perspectives. He’s worked for publications and media like The New Yorker, VICE, Adult Swim, The New York Times, Surfing Magazine and Valley Cruise Press. We had a chance to talk to John about the longest comic he’s ever written, the beginnings of Universal Slime and his many, many influences.
What is your inspiration for the Universal Slime series?
I started editing and publishing Universal Slime on a xerox machine at The School of Visual Arts when I was living in New York City. There were two common threads that sort of tied the first issue together and that have continued to be the thing that is in the front of my mind when I am asking people to contribute. The first was comic and zine artists who had begun to do editorial and client related work outside of the comic and zine community (Patrick Kyle, Paul Windle, Rand Renfrow, Michael Deforge) and the second was illustrators who were creating work in and around the various DIY/Punk scenes at the time (Nicholas Gazin, Matthew Volz, Alex Schubert, James Payne, C.M. Ruiz).
Every edition of Universal Slime seems to have a new theme and style, what can we look forward to with this newest edition?
This issue is a solid mix of comic artists and studio artists. I have always tried to strike a balance between artists who mostly show in galleries and artists who mostly create zines and comics. To me there is overlap between everyone that I include because I really don’t do a “call for submissions.” I specifically ask people that I think would make cool and interesting work. The first artist I included that submitted his work, is in this issue though (speaking of submissions). This dude Tor Brandt that I think is based in Denmark (sorry Tor if that is incorrect) mailed me his comics/zines last year and I really liked them a lot. But I think he might be the first person that was not invited to be in it, that I have included.
Who are your artistic influences?
The Hairy Who, Keith Haring, Robert Crumb, Harvey Pekar, Richard Hell, Gary Panter, Kierkegaard/Camus existentialist philosophy, golden-era Nickelodeon programming, 80s/90s era WWF, WCW, and ECW, R.L. Stine’s Goosebumps, Pre-Code Horror Comics, The Knightfall comics and Kelley Jones’ interpretation of Batman, Old Sci-Fi and Western Pulp illustrations, The Fleischer Brothers, The storytelling and scripts of 8-bit Video, 70’s and Early 80’s Punk Aesthetic (Sniffin’ Glue, Raymond Pettibon, and piles of Xerox Fuzz), The patterns and colors used on the set of Double Dare, VHS horror movie box art, Martin Handford, The Simpsons action figures by Mattel, Klasky-Csupo, Jack Kirby, and Artie the Strongest Man in the World.
Which artists have contributed to this edition of Universal Slime?
Jordan Awan, Siobhán Gallagher, Box Brown, Bad Buzz, Josh Cochran, Homeless Cop, Josh Freydkis, Katie Turner, Maelle Doliveux, Sam Grinberg, Taylor Johnson, Grant Kratzer, Keith Pakiz, Bill Rebholz, Sean Solomon, Tor Brandt, Matthew Volz, Daniel Zender, and more, and more, and more!
What part of this edition are you most excited about?
That is such a hard question! Josh Freydkis killed the cover design and illustration. My girlfriend and massive comic talent Siobhán Gallagher wrote a really great and beautiful comic about quitting smoking. I am featuring some street art by the Barcelona based bro named Bad Buzz that is inspired by the old video game Gauntlet. Box Brown wrote a cool and quick two-page comic. Daniel Zender sent me some of his new brain-melting paintings; Sam Grinberg completely crushed this four-page comic that reminds me of something you’d see in Raw Magazine; Sean Solomon, Matthew Volz, and Maelle Doliveux are all respectively cookin’ up something good, and this dude Homeless Cop is making a #fucktrump ad. I am more excited about this issue than any I have released yet.
What music are you listening to when you are creating?
Currently in heavy rotation: Swishahouse (Paul Wall, DJ Michael 5000 Watts, Lil Keke, Slim Thug, Texas Chopped & Screwed stuff), TK Webb, Onra, 9 Shocks Terror, Mac Demarco, Glass Animals, Choking Victim, Vaguess, Daniel Johnston, Vietnam, The Babies, Dan Deacon, and Talking Heads.
If you could have dinner with anyone (dead or alive) who would it be?
Kurt Vonnegut
What else are you working on at the moment?
I have two solo shows opening up this fall. One at No Place Studios in Columbus, Ohio on my birthday October 15th (curated by James McDevitt-Stredney). And the other is opening on New Year’s Eve at Brain Freeze Gallery in Seattle, Washington (curated by C.M. Ruiz).
Me and Siobhán Gallagher are editing a book of art, comics, and illustration about the end of the world called Till Doomsday, that we plan to release together at 2017 comic fests — we have a collaborative zine of drawings coming out at Comic Arts Brooklyn that we have been doing in a .PSD document through e-mail. I am also publishing a series of mini-zines from Universal Slime artists. The first four are by the Cleveland-based poet punk Mike Marine, Matthew Volz (the official artist of the Jackson Heights, Queens band The Beets), the Los Angeles based weirdo Josh Freydkis, and Barcelona based street artist Bad Buzz.
I am currently working on the longest comic that I have ever written. It is being published through a grant from The University of Central Missouri and follows this punk dude named Tight James and his dog friend Lone Jack. They play basketball, eat pancakes, and philosophically deconstruct ideas on life and death and existence. I am publishing it in three issues and then collecting it into a hardcover edition next year. Issue One will be out at Comic Arts Brooklyn and Comic Arts Los Angeles!
And lastly, the thing I am most excited about, I have a traveling radio show coming out called SSSSLAM DUNK where I play a game of pickup basketball with various artists, musicians, creative directors, and writers and then interview them in the wake of our pick up game. It starts airing on Radio Free Brooklyn’s fourth season this November on Mondays from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. eastern/standard time.

Getting the angle right, your personal brand photo

Police kill two people for wearing women's clothes in Saudi Arabia

In a shocking incident, two transgender Pakistanis died in Riyadh on Tuesday (28 February) after being allegedly tortured by the Saudi Arabia police.
The two victims, identified as Meeno, 26, and Amna, 35, were reportedly in a rest house for cross-dressers and transgender women during a formal gathering when the police raided the site.
"While 11 were released later after paying a fine of 150,000 riyals ($40,000, €37,500), 22 are still in police custody", Naseem added.
"Majority of the arrested, belong to K-P and the others from other cities of Pakistan". After all, it is institutional edicts that persecutes individuals be they transgender, converts to Christianity, or women seeking exclusively to dress freely.
'The suffering ended for these two after being physically tortured, however, the rest are still languishing in Saudi jails.
Pakistani transgender rights activist Qamar Naseem slammed the alleged police brutality as "inhumane".
Farzana, a Khawaja Sara and head of transgender rights group TransAction, told The Express Tribune that the police's actions were criminal, as those accused of crimes have a right to be tried in court.
In addition to the criminalization of cross-dressing, transgender people are banned from making the religious pilgrimage to Mecca.
Saudi authorities consider any blending of gender roles, including cross-dressing, as varieties of homosexuality, which is criminalized in the theocratic kingdom.
It is high time to treat Saudi Arabia based on being "a pariah" until real political reforms are implemented. In 2009, 67 men were arrested in Riyadh for wearing women's clothing, according to Human Rights Watch. They received lashes and jail time for the offense.

Luke Perry
By Cindy Elavsky
Q: I was thrilled to see that Luke Perry and Jason Priestley were working together again in the Hallmark Channel movie “Goodnight for Justice.” How did that opportunity come about for them to get together? — Gina H., via e-mail
A: I spoke with Luke recently, and he gave me the scoop on how it all went down: “I like working with Jason a lot. There is a company involved in making this movie called Entertainment One. They work here in the United States, but they are based in Canada. So, if you are in business with them you have to do your stuff in Canada, which means you have to have a Canadian director. And when they said Canadian, I thought, ’I’ve got one of those.’ That was easy enough, and it was the right way to go because he’s a smart director. It was great working with him on this.”

Q: Is Donald Trump going to film another “The Celebrity Apprentice”? I like the original “Apprentice” just fine, but the celebrity version is always so much more fun! — Tiffany T., Atlanta
A: You can bet The Donald knows a good thing when he sees it. Another round of celebs have been rounded up for this next installment of the competition, which crowned Bret Michaels as its winner last year. This time around, the participants are: David Cassidy, NeNe Leakes, LaToya Jackson, Lisa Rinna, Dionne Warwick, Gary Busey, Jose Canseco, original “Survivor” winner Richard Hatch, Lil Jon, Meat Loaf, Mark McGrath, John Rich, Hope Dworaczyk, Star Jones, Marlee Matlin and Niki Taylor.

Q: What did you think about Ricky Gervais’ hosting of the Golden Globes? Some people think he was too mean, but to be honest, I thought he was spot on. — Eric P., St. Louis
A: I agree with you, Eric. Either the Hollywood Foreign Press Association did not give out enough booze to loosen up the celebs, or some of them are feeling a bit too self-important these days. As we learned last year, Ricky’s style of hosting is roast-like, which is a style of comedy most Americans love — as long as they are not the intended target. Instead of people like Bruce Willis, Tim Allen and Tom Hanks getting their shorts in a bunch about Ricky’s jokes, it would have been funnier — and would have made it all less awkward — if they would have just played along instead of pompously butting heads.
* * *
Q: One of my favorite shows was “Six Feet Under.” I know Peter Krause is in “Parenthood” and Michael C. Hall is the star of “Dexter,” but what is Lauren Ambrose, who played Claire, up to lately? — David F., via e-mail
A: The beautiful redhead just joined the cast of “Torchwood,” which is set to premiere its fourth season July 1 on Starz. According to Entertainment Weekly, Lauren, 32, will play a heartless public-relations guru named Jilly Kitzinger for 10 episodes.

Work Of Art
We live in an age of plenty, when poverty is defined by not having the latest designer clothing or an internet enabled smartphone, there is a new, invisible kind of poverty. It can be seen in the faces of people who look affluent and well provided for, in the emptiness in their eyes. It is not poverty through lack of money but deprivation of those bonds of family and community that anchor us spiritually. Such separation can often lead to loneliness, isolation, depression and insanity, true poverty among material plenty as depicted in this story in verse based on a real event.
Work Of Art
by Ian R Thorpe
circa 1980
CREATIVE COMMONS: Attribute, non commercial, no derivs.
KEYWORDS: poetry, poem, poet, verse, rhyme, insanity, loneliness, isolation, care, bureaucracy
The first man she loved was a loser,
the second pumped a fortune in his arm
the third one was OK
but her kids got in the way.
All the rest seemed determined to abuse her,
she always fell for that rough macho charm.
She was looking old before she reached thirty,
Her dreams and her looks were long gone.
She tried to turn things round
but plans just hit the ground
then every love she found made her feel dirty
and she could see no cause to carry on.
Arrested walking naked in a garden,
she lost her clothes, her dignity, her mind,
she recalled every promise
made by men she thought were honest,
she searched for a way to lift the burden
but selfish love was all she could find.
The world always shuns those who need a haven,
nobody has time just to be kind.
So the weak must fall
while the strong take all.
To those who have, more will be given
while those who only give must fall behind.
She was living all alone in a high tower,
a carer came; paid by the state to care.
There was daily medication
and a weekly consultation
but official pity could not empower
bureaucracy to reach through her despair
She painted her self portrait on the concrete
in vivid reds and pastel pink skin tones.
Falling was a dream,
her death song a silent scream.
Now last last her tragedy's complete;
a work of art in shattered flesh and bones.

Audio Poems MenuThe era of super materialism and consumer led economic booms has raised expectations to unrealistic levels and politically correct thinking in education and the media has generated a sense of entitlement and a culture of victimhood. But do we really have to waste our lives wishing? asks British poet Ian R Thorpe in this evocative poem
For An American GirlA reflection in verse on a fondly remembered love affair, the energy of being young and the magic of a beautiful setting. This poem by Ian R Thorpe is set to a classical music accompaniment tells of a long ago summer love affair that took place during a summer spend with friends in New Your State. A good morale booster for those grieving over a lost relationship as this poem reminds readers that thoough life moves on the experience and the love stay with us forever.
ArmageddonClimate change, cultural conflict, overpopulation, algae bloom killing the oceans, volcanic winter, asteroid collission, Armageddon has many disguises and the purveyors of fear and panic are eager to use them all. In this poem which could be classed as comic verse, British poet Ian Thorpe ponders what might await those who survive Armageddon. It is not nice
Beloved SuccubusLove and grief are probably the two strongest emotions. Grieving for the death of a loved one then is bound to lead the mind into strange places. Beloved Succubus a poem performed to music shows how love and grief can create a vampire that drains the life force as it calls the survinging lover towards the darkness.
Boys GamesHave you ever thought there is something a bit iffy about the super macho male. All the drinking, being crude, treating women like sex dolls etc. And what about the team sports? I've always been suspicious of all that bonhomie in the showers...
Casual Sex In New YorkA story of a one night stand and the emotional emptiness of the New York singles scene in the 1970s. This is not a personal experience of disconnected sex but is contructed from observations in New York City and stories told me later by a lover in London who had experienced the singles scene from close up.
Favourite BoyIn this poem British poet Ian R. Thorpe wonders what happened to those little shits who made our lives misery in school, who were fortunate enought to be good at sport which gave immunity from sanction. Too often the bully escapes while anyone who fights back is punished. Audio with music.
PianoA narrative poem of love, lust and social divisions. The poem describes with the voice of a man who has lain in the gutter looking at the stars* his love affair with a wealthy, cultured socialite, the irresistable sex urge that binds them, desires that draw them together and the social constraints that drive a wedge between them. Audio: poem read by Ian R Thorpe, music performed by Brother Bastion.
Late Nite MovieThe poem Late Night Movie takes you on a walk through the mean streets of any city after midnight, an unusual topic for poetry maybe but this verse comes alive in the spoken word performance delivered over a manic music track by British poet Ian R Thorpe
Suzanna's TitsA reflection in verse on a fondly remembered love affair, the energy of being young and the magic of a beautiful setting. This poem by Ian R Thorpe is set to a classical music accompaniment tells of a long ago summer love affair that took place during a summer spend with friends in New Your State.

WishingThe era of super materialism and consumer led economic booms has raised expectations to unrealistic levels and politically correct thinking in education and the media has generated a sense of entitlement and a culture of victimhood. But do we really have to waste our lives wishing?
Love Like ChainsTo many people love is the thing that sets them free but to some it is a prison. This poem by English poet Ian R. Thorpe looks at how some women in particular are slaves to jealousy and wear their love like chains.

There are sheeple who want to remain in the EU at any price, and then there are people who understand the EU
I am not sure people really are up for reading EU related documents or a whole load more people would be less excited about the EU. If people read the chequers plan and the political declaration they would know the only people who leave the EU are the financial sector. Everyone else stays in without a vote or veto for two years whilst we negotiate the long term deal...
EU Very Good for Germany, Not So Much for Everybody Else

Gang of Migrants Allegedly Raped Underage Italian Girls
Over the past few years we have focused on reporting the numerous incidences of immigrant sex crimes against white British girls and women, most of which, due to the warped morality of politically correct thinking that permeates all levels of government and the public sector, went largely unpunished for many years until public pressure forced the authorities to act. Migrant sex crimes, and government cover - ups of them are not exclusive to Britain of course, we have occasionally looked at similar problems in Sweden, Germany and France. And now it seems, Italian women are to be sacrificed to the gods of multiculturalism.

UK Taxman is 'ruthlessly' pursuing its own contract staff for potential six-figure bills in unpaid tax
The tax service had decided we were using the self employed status to avoid National Insurance Employers Contributions (a sanitized name for a British payroll tax,) as the self employed were not liable for this levy. By reinterpreting a law in such an extreme way it stretched words beyond any literal meaning, the taxman decided we should all set up limited companies, with ourselves as the only employee, thus making our employers, the quasi - companies, liable as our employers for the payroll tax.

Tennis legend Martina Navratilova has again come under fire for comments about transgender women in sport, reiterating her belief that some of the rules currently in place are “insane and cheating,” and unfair to other women.

The Full Nine Orwells
How The EU Abandoned The Concept Of Truth
Though we were forwarned of what was to come, the EU has now launched its Action Plan against Disinformation.

France’s yellow vest protesters hit the streets again last weekend. It's reported that numbers were up, not only in Paris but also in many provcincial centres where protests took place.

The Importance Of Freedom Of Speech and Information
Politically Correct attitudes try to dictate to us how we should behave towards each other with the emphasis on not saying anything likely to cause offence (sic),which seriously inhibits our right to express opinions.

Security Expert: Sweden is “On the Way to Civil War”
International security consultant Olle Fjordgren has issued a stark warning that his native Sweden is “on the way to civil war” as a result of the problems caused by mass immigration, a soft justice system that often seems to blame victims of crime as much as the prepetrators, and inability to tackle lawlessness among immigrants in the country’s expanding “no go zones” where crime is rampant.

The Truth About Climate Change Is Not On The Cover Of The Rolling Stone
Rolling Stone was once a decent music magazine, in fact my title references a Dr. Hook song lyric which made the claim that you have ‘arrived’ when you get your picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone. Alas, like so much connected with music, entertainment and Hollywood, The Rolling Stone has disappeared up its own arse. Now, instead of sticking with what it is good at, Rolling Stone fancies itself as a left wing opinion maker ...

Ten years after The G20 first convened to bring together the leaders of world’s main powers and controllers of natural resources. The Group of 20 was doomed from the start.

The Full Orwell - UK Government Comes Over All Big Brother

The Dark Motives Behind The FUKUS axis Regime Change In Libya
At around that time, a coalition of western powers, France, The UK and The USA (the FUKUS axis,) had deposed the Libyan dictator Muammar Gadaffi and turned Libya from the most prosperous and socially advanced nation on the African continent to a chaotic failed state with three rival factions, the Islamists, tribal warlords and gangsters all claiming to be the legitimate government.

Scientists tend to get carried away with enthusiasm fort theor latest idea, which they invariably claim will bring great benefits to humankind.

One of the UK’s highest ranking police officers has attacked the government's policy of prioritising “hate crimes,” over serious crimes such as theft, vandalism, violence and fraud, calling for officers to be reassigned to investigate more burglaries and violent attacks by focusing on “core policing.”
Most British people agree police have lost control of the streets because of politically correct government policies
One of the UK’s highest ranking police officers has attacked the government's policy of prioritising “hate crimes,” over serious crimes such as theft, vandalism, violence and fraud, calling for officers to be reassigned to investigate more burglaries and violent attacks by focusing on “core policing.”
National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) Chair Sara Thornton CBE also said she did not want to see “misogyny” and offensive comments about women specified in law as hate crimes. One can only hope she feels the same about truthful criticisms of Islam, which glorifies misogyny, violence and rape.

Elites Losing The War On Cash? Sweden U-Turns On 'Cashless Society' Agenda
Sweden was leading the the War On Cash, the ruling elite had pushed the idea that a cashless society would protect citizens from crime and be more convenient. There was no mention that in a cashless society we would completely surrender control of our money to banks, and our privacy in financial matters to government security agencies...
Presentiment?—?Can Your Body Sense Future Events Without Any External Clue?
Recent work at the limits of scientific enquiry is looking at the phenomenon of presentiment (knowing stuff is going to happen before it happens) Research in this area is discovering our bodies may anticipate events below our level of normal consciousness. This is entirely consistent with the work already done in the physics associated field, Quantum Entanglements.
Lancashire Bans ‘Cruel' Halal Meat From Schools, But Some Councils ‘Kow-tow to Islam’ and Serve Halal
In a rare example of politicians putting British values first, Lancashire council voted to cease serving meat from animals that are not stunned before slaughter in schools. Although it signals a step in the right direction after a decade of leftists pushing officials towards favouring Islamic communities over Secular and Christian citizens, around one in 10 UK councils are still supplying sharia compliant halal meat to schools .
Scaremongering IPCC Pushes Climate Hysteria With Latest Doomsday Report
Those discredited jokers, gropers and fake scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have surpassed themselves in the idiocy stakes in their latest report (Summary for Policy Makers linked below). It is just a rephrased version of the farrago of adjusted data, dubious science, wailing and gnashing of teeth and eco-fascistic edicts on how we shall all live our lives in the future.
Universal Basic Income Is Silicon Valley’s Latest Scam…The plan is no gift to the masses, but a tool for our further enslavement
A daft idea from socialist intellectual idiots that has quickly acquired sacred cow status among the mindless mobs that make up 'the left' is Universal Basic Income. Among the most prominent champions of UBI are a clutch of Silicon Valley billionaires, whose complete lack of ethical awareness and track record for exploiting low paid workers should make us wonder why we continue to support their shoddy products.
Censorship Comes To The Internet - Goodbye Free Speech
Censorship has always been a sore point in democratic societies, without the right to free speech democracy does not exist. So why have we for years now been willing to tolerate the efforts of Silicon Valley high tech corporations and their left - leaning (that's left as in Chairman Mao or Pol Pot,) been willing to tolerate this.
How Many Times Can Dr. Merkel-Who Regenerate Her Government
>This week the new series of Doctor Who launched amid much ballyhoo about The Doctor being played for the first time by a woman. While many pedantic Whooverans are appalled and complain that the lead role belongs to a man, in my opinion Jodie Whittaker (best known to date for Broadchurch,) the thirteenth Doctor Who, looks as if she may be the best Doctor since David Tennant.
Algorithms Are No Better At Telling The Future Than Tarot Cards Or A Crystal BallAccording to a new report “An increasing number of businesses are investing in advanced technologies that can help them forecast the future”. It’s true , almost every day we see supposedly intelligent people who believe that with things called ‘Data Science’, ‘Artificial Intelligence,’ and ‘Big Data’, machines can already be relied on to make better decisions than humans, and that soon computers will surpass us in actual intelligence.
E.U. Parliament Members Call for Facebook Audit, Competition Law Overhaul
Though not widely reported (well the proceedings were boring,) a number of parliamentary hearings in the European Parliament and the elected assemblies of member nations, have investigated Facebook’s user data breach scandal involving the data thieves Cambridge Analytica. European Union MEPs, including those from Britain have called for a full audit of the social media company and an overhaul of E.U. competition law.
Vaccine Damaged Child Compensated By US Special Vaccine Court. As they started their family, Mooresville residents Theresa and Lucas Black dutifully got their children immunized, never doubting their doctor’s word that vaccines are safe and necessary. But their faith in those promises was shaken in 2001, when their 3-month-old daughter, Angelica, developed life-threatening seizures and brain damage just three days after getting several vaccinations.
How Many More Lives Does Angela Merkel Have Left?
Germany was the most prosperous and stable democracy in Europe under Hausfrau - Volksfuhrer Merkel until she won her third term as Chanellor. That victory had the same effect as being declared divine once had on Roman Emperors. Merkel began to believe she could change the world by supporting schemes to unite Europe under a single government and flood the continent with third world migrants. And she believed she could succeed because Germans, the ignorant masses, would march in lockstep behind her.
Supreme Court Fiasco Shows The US Democratic Party Is No Friend Of Democracy
A look at the way efforts by the US Democratic Party to shaft Trump have backfired on them. Trump is no politician for sure, he's undiplomatic, confrontational, crude, economical with the truth when it suits him, and very direct in expressing his views (a change from the mealy mouthed equivocation favoured by most politicians, but whatever his failings, he's a smart operator and he's outwitting the Democrats every time.
How Can The 'Left' Talk Of Equality When They Don't Tolerate Diversity Of Opinion
One of the first things I learned at my Grandfather's knee was the importance of free speech and of exposure to different ides and shades of opinion. Grandad had been a member of the Labour party before World War One and had lived through the class wars early in the twentieth century. My Dad was a Labour man too, until as a newspaper reporter, he learned things about socialism that shocked him.
Brexit has terrified 'Brussels bubble' - German insider The EU elite "lost faith in their own appeal and abilities" following the Brexit referendum vote and the surge in support for nationalist parties. The knee jerk response of the Brussels bubble was to try (and fail) to punish Britain for defing Brussels in the same way as they had punished small nations like Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which in their perception was the only way to prevent the EU breaking apart.
How Russia plans to disentangle its economy from US dollar
The Russian Finance Ministry this week officially revealed a plan to end the country's dependence on the US dollar for foreign trade. Economic analysts are warning it will be a long process, but Russia and China, with support from Iran and a number of other oil rich countriies whose oil trade is restricted by US use of the petrodollar to manipulate makets, are several years along the road to economic independence alredy ...

The ‘Zen’ of NRx
November 9, 2016
Conventions everywhere are being challenged: The first amendment. Democracy. Civil rights. An this dissent transcends political lines, as both the ‘left’ and the ‘right’ (and the many variants in between) realize that these conventions are either ineffective, incomplete, or, worse, are part of the problem.
The ‘status quo’ presupposes all 20-30 somethings are only interested in passive consumption, home ownership, voting, majoring in liberal arts subjects, engaging in small talk about sports and entertainment, getting a dead-end job, or watching the latest bland and recycled storyline that passes for Hollywood entertainment. Reality paints a different picture. Yes, many millennials are interested in those things, but many are also interested in debating finance and economics online; studying physics, philosophy, and coding; working to live instead of living to work; self-sufficiency and minimalism; engaging in deep conversations about philosophical matters; and exploring niche ideologies (such as alt-right, an-cap, libertarianism, and MGTOW) that are outside the purview of the left/right dichotomy. This ravenous intellectual curiosity and contrarian streak, which seems unique to millennials, may explain this upheaval.
Although NRx is anti-revolutionary, it challenges the status quo, which (along with the alt-right and other related movements) explains its appeal among many 20 and 30-somethings who have grown tired of these banal conventions which society holds everyone to. Convention is that you have to vote to make difference, or else you ‘cannot complain’ or are ‘part of the problem’. NRx, as part of the growing post-2013 anti-democracy movement, flips this around by arguing that voting, democracy, and politics is the problem, not the solution. In addition to anti-democracy writings, I take it a little further, extending my writings to economics and finance in the context of reactionary thought. Just as NRx rejects sensationalism and ‘low information’ discourse, so to does this apply to my criticism of the financial media, which is mostly useless and sensationalist.
Despite my support of Trump and being on the ‘right’, I oppose how Alex Jones and Zero Hedge spread sensationalist doom and gloom to get their followers to act out of fear against their best interests (such as by buying overpriced gold and other bad investments, or selling their stocks in a strong bull market). Fear is a very powerful emotion that often leads to irrational decisions, and part NRx and related rationalist ideologues is learning how suppress this instinctive tendency to fall for hype, high pressure sales pitches, and unnecessary calls to action – hence, where pacifism comes into play. For the left-wing media, it’s for spreading false rape hoaxes and inciting digital lynch mobs against innocent targets.
One can liken ‘reaction’ to a form of ‘zen’ whereby you tune out all the unnecessary distractions. For example, all those useless financial pundits last week who said to sell due to the possibility of a Trump victory – fast forward a week later and markets are up 4%, having regained all of last week’s losses and then some. Had you heeded their advice, you would have sold at the bottom. Or all the endless predictions between 2009-2015 of hyper-inflation and bear markets, none of which came to fruition. Just one of many examples of where pacifism pays. That’s not to say all action is abhorred. If someone is breaking into your home or threatening your life, action may be necessary, but one should pick and choose their battles wisely.

Fianna Fáil’s management has been accused of “closing the door too early” on the prospect of celebration membership for presidential runner-up Peter Casey.
Mr Casey, who attracted virtually one in 4 of the votes forged in Friday’s presidential election, has additional stirred issues up by saying Fianna Fáil wanted his management.
He additionally stated if he couldn’t be a part of the celebration he might type his personal celebration calling it “new Fianna Fáil”.
The newest feedback by the businessman-turned-politician have been dismissed out of hand by a number of main Fianna Fáil TDs who stated his marketing campaign feedback about Travellers and other people relying on welfare rendered him unsuitable for social gathering membership. However one Fianna Fáil councillor, Michael Cahill of Kerry, stated the get together’s hierarchy ought to give critical consideration to Mr Casey’s bid to hitch the celebration.
“I feel the get together hierarchy have closed the door too early on this concept. I don’t consider Mr Casey is a racist or something prefer it. He’s a person who spoke his thoughts and what he needed to say resonated with many individuals since he acquired almost one in 4 of the votes forged,” Cllr Cahill informed the Irish Unbiased.
Cllr Cahill efficiently proposed that Kerry County Council endorse Mr Casey’s candidature final month. This gave the Unbiased contender the primary of the required 4 council endorsements to get on the poll paper.
Mr Casey yesterday additional stoked issues by saying he would supply management to Fianna Fáil and go on to turn into Taoiseach. “They undoubtedly want somebody like Peter Casey to shake it up,” he informed Miriam O’Callaghan on RTÉ Radio 1.
“I am 100laptop critical. If the consensus after speaking to them is they do not need me, I am going to type a brand new social gathering and I am going to name it the brand new Fianna Fáil,” he added.

However Fianna Fáil’s Éamon Ó Cuív stated he might by no means vote for Mr Casey – even when he was the one candidate in an election – given his derogatory feedback about Travellers.
Limerick TD Willie O’Dea stated his feedback about individuals unfortunate sufficient to need to rely upon welfare made it unlikely he can be match to be a celebration member. He stated Mr Casey confirmed “unbridled vanity” claiming he would prime the ballot.

What Do Readers Want More: Quantity or Quality?
By Jody Hedlund, @JodyHedlund
Recently I took an informal poll over on my Facebook Page. I asked readers this question: How many books a year would you like your favorite authors to write? Is ONE enough? Or would you like to read MORE than one per year?
Many writers are feeling pressure to increase their production to earn more as well as to remain in the public spotlight. Thus, many are tackling multiple projects. Some authors I know are writing 3 to 4 books a year. Others are writing two and supplementing with epublished novellas or short stories.
Let’s face it, epublishing is changing how writers do business. Because of the ease and faster pace inherent in publishing a manuscript in e-format (versus the long process involved in traditional publication), self-published ebooks can naturally hit virtual bookshelves at a much faster pace.
And now that self-published ebooks are coming out at a quicker rate, the pace has affected all authors (including traditionally published). Authors everywhere are putting pressure on themselves to keep up and to find success.
However, the real question is—what do READERS want. Do they really want more from their favorite authors? Or are they satisfied with one book per year?
As I said, I asked that question over on Facebook. And I was a little surprised by the answers I received.
Plenty of readers said they would love for their favorite authors to write more than one book a year. The majority of those wanting more, said “At least two.”
This was especially true of books in a series. Readers felt that waiting a year for the next book in a series was just too long to go between books.
One reader said this about waiting for a series book: “It sort of 'cools' off the reader when that happens. I would have bought that next book right away if it had been out. I wonder why the publishing company doesn't postpone the books in the series so they come out closer together.”
Another reader said this about series: “When too much time lapses it is hard to keep up with the people in the book and remember what is going on, especially if you are a big time reader.”
Other readers mentioned that while they would ideally love to have more books to read from their favorite authors, they understood how complicated the research and writing process are and know they have to be patient and realistic.
But . . . amidst all of the comments about wanting more, I found that a large number of comments mentioned that they would much rather have one quality book from an author they love, then multiple books that aren’t really up to par. Here were just a few comments:
“Too many books too soon results in poor writing. I've read some of the commercially popular authors, and I've been disappointed more often than not. If an author has a good story to tell, and knows how to tell it well, I'm willing to wait a little longer.”
“I would rather an author take whatever time is needed to make the book the best it can be, than be pressured to produce books too quickly that fall short of their best effort.”
“If it depended on the quality of the book I would rather have one good one than two decent ones.”
“I’d rather wait then have higher frequency but lower quality. I'll consider not continuing to read an author for poor quality, no matter how many books they've written, but I won't stop reading just because they take longer to write.”
My Summary: From what I can tell quality is much more important than quantity. Writers can spit out several books a year—if they really want to. But if we’re beginning to compromise the quality of our writing and story to keep up with the frantic pace, then we’re only hurting ourselves.
In the race to keep up and produce, we can’t lose sight of the fact that ultimately readers want a well-told story that they can fall in love with. The STORY still trumps everything else.
Side note: The quality of writing depends upon many factors. Fast-writing doesn’t necessarily equate poor quality any more than slow writing means the book will be good. However, I think it’s true that fast-writing can potentially lead to sloppiness.
Whether we crank out numerous stories per year or just one, readers aren’t going to care about our books unless we reach deep inside them, grab them tightly, and refuse to let go. If we don’t grip them, then it won’t matter whether we publish one book a year or ten—because they won’t buy any of them.
So, writers, don’t lose focus of the main thing. Tell a riveting story. That’s what readers care about most.
"Quality is not an act; it is a habit." ~Aristotle
What’s been your experience? Does your quality of writing go down the faster you write? What do YOU prefer from an author—quality or quantity?

Good Morning! :)
I'm a bit happy right now-and surprised- that I'm the first one to comment!
This really interesting Jody, thanks!
I agree with the reader who was mentioning that sometimes when you're reading a series and have to wait a year to get the next book, well, sometimes you forget what was in the previous one , which can complicate things. And then again, there are times when I'm reading a book and I feel as though the author really didn't know what else to write (mostly towards the end) - I hope I'm not the only reader? All to say, that quality matters really, so I guess it's worth the wait. And one last thing, I think that if an author published too many books in a year, I would sort of loose interest really...
Not sure if I'm making any sense//smiling// but thanks for the post.
Have a GREAT day, Jody!

I, too, would rather writers put out the best book they can rather than quantity but I also understand that demands are being made of them to increase the product, so to speak. Being a writer, I hope to put out my best effort, and I don't want to get so fast-paced that I shirk that responsibility: to give the reader a good read.

Quality. Julie Klassen publishes one book a year, but it is always worth reading.
Other authors pump out four a year, and they feel like pulp.
But I do agree on the series - if you have a trilogy, plan to release all three within a year (e.g. March - September - March). Otherwise we readers do lose the plot, as we have read so many books in between.

Goodmorning Ganise, Traci, & Iola! Thanks for sharing, ladies!
Ganise, I'm with you on losing interest if an author is publishing too many books a year. I think I'd lose that sense of anticipation and excitement for the author. It would be kinda like having Christmas every month. The specialness of the holiday/book release might begin to wear off.

I like that : "writers, don’t lose focus of the main thing. Tell a riveting story. That’s what readers care about most." It's so true I would rather read quality over quantity:) Didn't realize that people would like to have a series close together...I guess that makes sense. I do tend to forget the characters and the story if it's over a year until the next book. I guess I better make sure I'm writing the next book here soon :-)
thanks, Jody...great post as always!

Yes!!!!! I quit reading the books of two best selling romance authors because they were churning out books too quickly and there were too many mistakes. It felt like no one edited or copy edited them. And we're talking big mistakes, like characters who weren't in the scene are suddenly talking and other characters are talking about themselves in third person. And then there was the book where the love interest is wearing jeans in one paragraph and leather pants in the next. He managed to change while sitting at the dinner table.

The quantity of books a writer can put out in a year depends on genre.
Nonfiction--where facts have to be straight, people interviewed, sources found, etc., will take longer. Historical fiction will take longer, as you know, Jody. Urban Fantasy can take the least amount of time--most of it is coming straight from the imagination. Contemporary whatever is next,as well as horror.
Another thing to consider is some authors can crank out quality and quantity work--they are just gifted that way.
I think each author should just focus on what s/he is capable of doing regardless of what another author is able to produce. I think we'll be happier. There's always someone who can do things quicker, better, with more polish and a stronger reach...
Another thing: Some authors may be revising old work, such as short stories from college, or prompts or even their first novel, or even the eleven they hadn't finished yet! Blessings!

This is great to hear. I'm always happy when quality is more in demand than quantity. That said, I do agree about waiting a year or more (particularly for books in a series) - and how that's a bit long. As a writer who LOVES writing a series, I'd still want my readers interested and anticipating the next book without feeling like it's not worth waiting that long.

The two little typos in your post are an example of what I find can happen if the process is rushed. (don't waste your time searching; effect/affect and then/than--too common) I switched names of a minor character in a recent book, probably because I had been thinking of both names at one time. I think artist/writers need to fight against being too market-driven.

I'd much rather have quality than quantity - nothing is sadder than discovering a new book by a favourite author is significantly lower in quality than their previous works. (Though, conversely, I don't mind reading early novels that aren't as good as later ones by my favourite authors, not least because I can see how their craft has developed and that's useful to me as a writer).
I think authors are under too much pressure nowadays to be commercial - the pile-it-high-sell-it-cheap philosophy that has taken over everything from clothes to wine in the past few decades. You find some bargains, but the majority is terrible quality.
I'd much rather wait longer and read a better book. My tastes are more literary than commercial, (though there's a lot of overlap and I don't automatically reject 'commerical' books - good stories are good stories).I feel incredibly spoilt this year, since so many of my favourite authors (Anne Tyler, Toni Morrison, Hilary Mantel) have new books out. But even if it was a 'dry' year, luckily there are plenty of great authors and new favourites waiting to be discovered!
For my own writing, writing quickly can produce good drafts, but I will always take time to ensure that I make my work as good as it can be at that point in time. Sometimes I can produce a good story relatively quickly; sometimes it takes ages. I think it probably all averages out.

I would say quality over quantity.
But for me, I don't necessarily have favorite authors. Just because I loved one book of theirs doesn't mean I'll love them all anyway. So I'd prefer to have them concentrate on that story and make it the best it can be, rather than pumping out too many that aren't worth my time.

So happy to see your follow-up post, Jody. And so pleased to hear the results of your oh-so-scientific poll. :-) I've always been a believer that quality is what matters. It's why I'm such a perfectionist when I write.
Each author has to find the balance that works best for him/her. Be aware of the market trends but don't be so obsessive about "keeping up" that you fail to take into account how much YOU can do well.
If it ain't worth doin' right, it ain't worth doin'.

I think it was Jodi Piccoult who said it takes her just as long to write a book as it does to 'grow' a baby...9 months. She just doesn't write any faster. I would prefer quality over quantity. As a new writer I am tempted to rush to self publish but I know that isn't a wise decision.

I concur with quality over quantity. If the story is compelling enough and well written, anticipation builds up toward the second book and so on. The Harry Potter series provides a perfect example. Superbly written, I couldn't wait for release day of each one.

I agree, quality far surpasses quantity. If I love an author, I don't mind waiting - I loved the analogy of Christmas! We're a fast paced, instant gratification society and we don't want to wait for anything anymore - but there is something special and magical about the wait - the anticipation only makes the experience more gratifying. I have quite a few favorite authors and I wait eagerly for their new releases, but thankfully there are hundreds of other authors I can read while I wait.

As a reader, I'd definitely go for quality. There are so many books out there to read in between, so I'll always check back for my favorite authors.
I'm not a big series reader precisely because I've found the quality to diminish as the series continues. Somehow, the pressure to keep a series going, even when there is nothing more to tell, tends to dampen my enthusiasm to read further. The first book usually has the freshest ideas, the most deeply layered plot and the careful characterization. Usually subsequent books bore me, and I'd rather the author wrote something completely new and unrelated than wade through another episode of the same old characters.
That goes with movies too, even famous ones. The most contrived plot device I see is leaving it hanging whether the villain is alive or dead. Of course, I know he'll be alive so the studio can milk another movie from it.
I guess this is a long-winded way of saying I'm not necessarily waiting with bated breath for the next installment of a series if it isn't completely fresh and new and takes off in a different direction. So don't rush. Take your time to let the work stew, let the flavors mingle and be absorbed so readers can savor a truly original and intriguing work.

The fact that readers prefer quality can become an opportunity for authors. Find out which other authors' style and themes are like yours, and let their fans know that while they are waiting for so-and-so's next book, they might like to try yours in the interim.

It's interesting from the author side of things. I find my motivation to produce more quickly is often fear based. My worries come from not having a title yearly or being forgotten by the public, when really I want to build a career and do my best work.
To those of you who can write a lot, I say hats off. I'm not there yet, and may very well never be. That's okay, too. There's room for all of us.

Quality rules. I like to think that even if our books come out at a slower rate that the readers will think it's worth the wait. Also, with a trilogy, I'd expect that new readers are found all the time. So eventually all the books are available right away.
That will be the case for me in January when book 3 releases. The series will be complete and all the books available as the readers want them.
I love the Aristotle quote. Great post, great information. Thanks Jody.

Great post. In my opinion, quality is always better than quantity. And though many readers may want two or more books a year, and it can get confusing with remembering plots for books in a series, if it's a really good book, I do sort of enjoy the suspense of waiting for the next one.

Jody...thanks so much for posting this. For my part, a really well written, thoughtful, riveting book can nourish me for quite some time. Certainly for a year. I recall my favorite parts; ruminate on the deeper meanings; ponder the life applications; speculate on the character's futures. I go back and re-read my favorite parts again, and sometimes even the entire book.
So I am more than willing to wait a year before the next one comes along. In fact, it heightens the anticipation for me, much like I wait with delicious excitement for the next Narnia movie, or the third National Treasure film, or the next project from Sherwood Pictures.
And like you, I expect and want each subsequent book (or film) to be excellent in quality, and that's not going to happen if the author's focus has been derailed from writing an excellent story, to instead keeping up a frantic pace. Not only will their work suffer, but so will other areas of their lives. It's not worth it.

In regards to letting the excitement cool off, I actually completely disagree. Look at movies that are released in a series - such as Harry Potter - the excitement didn't die off at all. If it's a really good author, and a really good series, you can spend an entire year looking forward to the next one and anticipating it. Just like when your favorite T.V. show airs its season finally, you don't move on over the summer, you wait expectantly for the following season premier. - And I'm sure everyone here knows that books are always better, so that makes them even more worth the wait.

Sometimes it does seem to be obvious, unfortunately, when an author has a multiple-book contract and they are just churning them out. The quality and depth does seem to suffer, as well as basic craft things that you would have hoped their editor would pick up. It's so frustrating - it feels like the whole team is just rushing the product to market without really caring about the readers.

“I’d rather wait then have higher frequency but lower quality. I'll consider not continuing to read an author for poor quality, no matter how many books they've written, but I won't stop reading just because they take longer to write.”
I find the above comment very reassuring! Not published, here, but I've been working on my first book for a year, and I'm nowhere near finished. I expect future books to go a bit faster, but I think I'll continue to be somewhat slow. My quality goes up with more time. At least, I believe it does!

I don't think I could write more than one book a year, unless I didn't do any revision. And THAT would just be madness. :)

In a series, I think more than a year between books can be a risk. I know I like being able to count on the next book in a series coming out on a regular schedule, otherwise I'll lose that connection to the characters.
Outside of a series, I don't have too much of a preference. There are so many authors I want to read that I won't begrudge one a break if it means I get to check out someone else's work.
For myself, I would happily write four or five books a year, but that's just because I get hooked on telling a story. If I could write full-time, I could probably crank out a whole series in a year or two. The main reasons I haven't tried that are because work and other committments eat into my time, I'm still new to the industry and don't want to rush into a writing schedule I can't maintain, and I'm also pretty sure that if I wrote ten books in 2 years, they'd be drivel!

I think it would be tragic to sacrifice your skills to satisfy a quota of books to put out. Writing is artistry. Creating a story is takes talent and hard work, but a beautiful well-written story is worth it.
Would I like my favorite authors to put out as many books as I could read? Sure, who doesn't want more of a good thing? But if doing so means that my favorite authors are putting out books that don't satisfy what made them my favorite authors in the first place? I would absolutely sacrifice quantity for quality.
Multiple books is great... but I'd rather have 3 or 4 great books than 10 so-so ones.

Jo - Yes, yes, yes! There are already more good books than I can read. I often discover authors when they already have a backlist out, so I can read those while I'm waiting for the new ones. Nothing worse than feeling that a favourite author's quality is going downhill. I can wait. :-)

Quality is paramount but the idea that a year is the optimum time to write a quality book is a false notion many readers have. It results from publishing schedules and non-compete clauses. Many of our favorite authors have long written more than one book a year, but did so under a pseudonym or as a ghost writer. Others could have written more than one a year, but did not bother to do so. Yes, some writers and some books take longer, but most writers complete drafts and revisions in a surprisingly short period of time. The rest of that year interim is consumed by waiting for the editor to even look at the book, waiting for edits, waiting again after the next draft, waiting for copyediting, waiting for galleys, and then waiting until a release date that the publisher feels will not cause the book to cannibalize sales of the author's previous work.

I realise this is quite an old blog post, but hopefully you don't mind me leaving a comment.
I self-published a short story three months ago. I still haven't published anything else. Numerous stories have been abandoned, one of them 5,000 words and probably nearly complete in rough form. I have high standards, because if I didn't, I'd have carried on and published them.
However, as much as it pains me to say this (though part of it is because I want to take advantage of the last two promotion days on my short story), I'm currently working on a story to publish before the 18th, so I feel like I'm rushing it. Still, if it's not ready, it's not ready. The reason why is because sales have been non-existent for the short story practically, despite a few good reviews, and I look around the Kindle store only to see authors pumping out 3 or so books a month that are each 30,000 words. I cannot imagine how little editing has gone into them and as I do freelance editing myself, I know I can catch most typos, though everyone needs an editor (with rare exceptions I guess). I just know they'll be better edited than what others pop out and they claim to have an editor. The books are selling too, even if they're not hugely popular, and writing errors are mentioned in some reviews. (The author I'm thinking of doesn't know that a full stop is meant to go inside the dialog tags, yet the author puts commas inside the tags. It's a small thing, which doesn't make much difference to the reading experience, but it shows the author doesn't know much about grammar and it's not the only problem going off the reviews.)
Then I take a look at erotica where a character's name is spelled 'Stephen' then switched to 'Steven', as an example, and the book sells very well. Well enough to get a big six publisher and dominate the Kindle charts. It was the author's first book too.
Anyway, I guess I'm jaded with the whole process, as I feel taking a very long time to write is not the best way to go about things, as I have financial difficulties, if I want to earn a living after seeing what people put out there and what sells. So, I'm really not sure that the masses want quality stuff.
It helps though that what I'm writing now is a bit niche at least in that it's a 'choose your own adventure' type book.

I hear what you're saying. A riveting story really does trump a few mistakes we might make in our manuscripts. If our story grips our readers they usually won't care too much about the rest. As a writer, if I had to choose quality techniques over quality of story, I'd definitely choose story. Thankfully we don't have to choose. We can still make sure we put out the best of both technique and story.
And I believe it's possible to have quantity as well. It just takes a lot of work and dedication to make it all work and do it right!

Our Founding Fathers Knew This Day Would Come
America’s Founding Fathers Knew This Day Would Come
“Tree Of Liberty Must Be Refreshed From Time to Time With The Blood Of Patriots & Tyrants.”
WASHINGTON DC - USA – As President Barack Hussein Obama vowed to put his full weight into banning and restricting gun ownership in the US in a landmark speech today, Americans across their great nation have an uneasy feeling inside of them. Their founding fathers warned them that this day would one day come.
America was built on the premise of Freedom, Liberty and Justice. The Founding Fathers of the United States of America fought so hard for their nation, for their people. They would be truly appalled at what is happening now in their cherished land, where Freedom is being choked, where Liberty is being smothered, and where Justice is being subverted.
George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Adams, Thomas Paine, Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, where are you now that your people need you so? Their spirits live only in the constitution of the United States but for how much longer?
How long can you, the people, stand by and watch the good decent American tenets that the Founding Fathers wrote, be torn up and thrown on the floor like a piece of trash? Are you going to stand there when they come to take away all of your freedom? Are you going to stand there when they tell you you are wrong to believe in Freedom, Justice and Liberty?
“Liberty, once lost, is lost forever” said John Adams.
And when they come for your guns remember these words from Thomas Paine: “It is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from its government.”
As the TSA worker touches your young daughter, quote these words from James Madison out to the people standing in the checkpoint: “If tyranny and oppression come to this land, it will be under the guise of fighting a foreign enemy.”
The Founding Fathers knew what was coming and they prepared the American people for this very outcome, they knew that some day the very government that was meant to govern the people would be the tyranny that terrorises the people. They knew that eventually things have to be treated to get better, just like an illness, America is sick and the only doctor that can cure it is YOU the people. Don’t let the corrupt tyranny put you in a FEMA camp. Don’t let the corrupt hypocrites and liars tell you that you are wrong to believe in the goodness that you believe in. Don’t let these pirates who have taken over change the laws anymore. YOU are the law. YOU the people are the law.
Thomas Jefferson knew what eventually happens in government when he said: “Experience hath shown that even under the best forms of government, those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.”
And to no end, he also meant it, when he said: “All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.”
America is silent now but for how long can the silence last?

OHLEsport’s Hague And Rose Announce Soccer Star Thalya Brooke As Newest OHLEsport Ambassador
Thalya Brooke Dwyer joins OHLEsport Ambassadors
Denver, CO - March 14, 2018 /MarketersMedia/ —
Chairman of the Board of OHLEsport Des Hague and President Justin J. Rose have announced their latest ambassador for youth outreach, Thalya Brooke, who is a Colorado native known for leading many of her soccer teams to national championships over the years. Denver-based OHLEsport (www.ohlesport.com) is the creator of The OHLEkick, OHLEpro and OHLEsport Total Training System. The goal of the OHLEsport Ambassador Program is to form strategic partnerships with national and international athletes to network across borders, promote the sport of soccer, and teach important soccer as well as life skills, that working with The OHLEsport Training System brings to its users. In addition, OHLEsport Ambassadors play a key role in OHLEsport community outreach, where a percentage of each purchase supports the OHLEsport Kids’ Future Fund; this fund serves to strengthen at-risk and underserved youths to find ways to a brighter future.
“"OHLEsport is committed to advancing the individual skills of all and at the same time doing good for the communities we serve,” stated Hague. “We are delighted to have Thalya join our Ambassador program and help us achieve both these objectives," concluded Hague.
“I am thrilled to be a part of the OHLEsport Ambassador program. The OHLE team is passionate not only about their products but about the development of soccer players and supporting kids in need. I am very excited to be a part of this journey,” said Dwyer.
Some of the highlights of Dwyer’s soccer career include Otero College’s team captain and starter of women’s soccer team, leading goal scorer and Player of the Year. She also played for 8 years with the REAL National Soccer Club in Denver, Colorado, and was starting midfielder and forward with ECNL (Elite Clubs National League). With her team, Dwyer took part in regionals, nationals and won State. In addition, she played and trained with 5 current women’s US National Team players and was coached by nationally-recognized coaches Lorne Donaldson Rafael Amaya, Chris Martinez and Rivers Guthrie.
After completing the German Soccer Experience, an international soccer training program put on by Rose’s JJR Consulting (www.JJRconsulting.net), Dwyer, a 21-year-old American (Colorado)/Australian, recently signed with German professional soccer women’s team Eintracht Frankfurt for 2017/18 season.
“It has been a real privilege the last few months helping Thalya achieve her dream of playing professional soccer in Germany,” said Rose. “The commitment and passion she has for improving herself as a person on and off the field is wonderful to see and be a part of. Having her as an OHLEsport Ambassador is a real honor for our team and will continue to inspire many to be the best they can be too. Eintracht Frankfurt Women’s team is so lucky to have Thalya,” concluded Rose.
“Thalya is a great choice for an OHLEsport ambassador,” said OHLEsport founder, Robert Ohle, and continued, “she has always shown a high level of professionalism with her great leadership skills. Her work ethics and a can-do attitude explains a lot about her success. OHLEsport is proud to welcome her aboard.”
About OHLEsport
Colorado-based OHLEsport, Inc. is dedicated to beginning through advanced training of soccer enthusiasts. After years of development, OHLEsport launched The OHLEsport Training System that helps every soccer player to develop the ‘first touch’, which is the most important part of any soccer player's skills. In the past, the first touch on the soccer ball was very time consuming and a difficult skill to teach and learn. Now with The OHLEkick, The OHLEpro and the OHLEsport Training System, one can teach and learn proper passing techniques, accurate traps and quick touch moves along with team drills.

Stocks, bond yields fall sharply as growth worries spread
Mar 23, 2019
Wall Street was roiled Friday by new signs that global economic growth is slowing. The jitters triggered a sell-off in stocks and sent bond yields sharply lower, flashing a possible recession warning. The wave of selling knocked 460 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average and gave the benchmark S&P 500 index its worst day since Jan. 3. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell more than the rest of the market as traders offloaded risker assets. Worried investors shifted money into bonds, which sent yields much lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 2.43 percent...
Markets Right Now: Stocks, yields drop on growth worries
Mar 23, 2019
NEW YORK — The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local): 4 p.m. Stocks closed broadly lower on Wall Street, erasing their gains for the week, as investors became increasingly worried that the global economy is slowing down. Traders shifted money into bonds and other low-risk assets Friday. Bond yields fell sharply, hurting bank stocks and flashing a possible recession warning. Citigroup slumped 4.6 percent. Boeing fell 2.8 percent after Indonesia's flag carrier said it would seek to cancel an order of the company's planes. The S&P 500 fell 54 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,800. The Dow...
Trump to nominate conservative Stephen Moore for Fed board
Mar 23, 2019
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Friday that he will nominate Stephen Moore, a conservative economic analyst and frequent critic of the Federal Reserve, to fill a vacancy on the Fed's seven-member board. Moore, a well-known and often polarizing figure in Washington political circles, served as an adviser to Trump during the 2016 campaign. In that role, he helped draft Trump's tax cut plan. Trump has been harshly critical of the Fed's rate increases even after the central bank announced this week that it foresees no hikes this year. Moore, formerly chief economist for the conservative Heritage Foundation, has also...
Italy, China deepen ties under wary gaze of US, EU
Mar 23, 2019
MILAN — Italy's head of state told visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday that China's new "Silk Road" linking Europe and Asia must be a "two-way street," addressing concerns among Western allies that the colossal infrastructure project is meant merely to amplify Beijing's global influence. During Xi's two-day official state visit, Italy is expected to become the first major democracy to sign an agreement to join China's "Belt and Road" initiative. The program aims to invest in ports, roads, airports and railways in Asia, Africa and Europe to create a conduit for trade and China's construction industry. Both the...
Stocks fall on growth worries, Brexit doubts
Mar 23, 2019
SINGAPORE — Stocks fell sharply in Europe on Friday after surveys showed manufacturing in the region slowed in March and amid news that the European Union offered only a brief extension to the Brexit deadline. U.S. markets also appeared headed for a lower open. Britain's FTSE 100 led the decline, trading down 1.3 percent at 7,260, while the CAC 40 in France slid 1.2 percent to 5,315. Germany's DAX lost 0.7 percent to 11,467. The future contract for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 percent lower at 25,828. That for the broad S&P 500 index also lost 0.7 percent,...

Ad Agencies And Hidden Agendas – How They Affect Company Marketing And The Average American
Ad Agencies And Hidden Agendas – How They Affect Company Marketing And The Average American
June 9, 2016 No Comments
There is a growing mistrust of the media in the United States. Never before has the American public felt as if they were mere pawns to some hidden agenda. Proof of such distrust is apparent by the accolades thrown at Presidential Candidate Donald Trump when he called a member of the media “sleazy”. It has long been suspected that ad agencies use hidden arrangements with businesses to increase their profits by unwittingly swaying the public, but now the allegations are being extended to the US media.
Leading the charge is the ANA, who represents such giants as Coca-Cola, General Motors, AT&T and Procter & Gamble. Their investigation found that as many as four-fifths of ad placements are based on undisclosed dealings that the clients are completely unaware of. The Association of National Advertisers recent report lends credence to the notion that media companies are being awarded rebates of various sorts due to undisclosed dealings with parent companies. What that means for the average American citizen is that the media may be nothing more than propaganda of the worst sort. The alleged secret hidden agendas are said to persuade agencies to spend their client’s money according to their interest only. Benefiting the ad agencies to the detriment of the clients they serve, many companies are calling for more investigative probes into the practices of ad agencies. The biggest problem plaguing the ad agencies is that there are no standards of ethics or controls. Allowed to operate pretty much rogue as they see fit, no wonder that solicited deals and payoffs are the norms in the industry. What it is leading to is widespread overcharging of clients and anti-competitive practices being perpetrated on companies from small time to Fortune 500. Although legal, rebates are a way that ad agencies entice consumers to monopolise their marketing and advertising. Promising that the more they use a specific ad agency, the more free ads and discounts they will receive, many companies will give them free reign to make decisions for the company’s overall marketing scheme.
Until now, most companies had no idea that the exposure they were gaining had nothing to do with the betterment of their marketing strategy. It is more based on secret agendas, hidden alliances and monopolising of the ad agencies and media guided by parent companies. What the ad agencies are practising is somewhat equal to the notion of insider trading or monopoly pricing tactics of other industries. The problem is that without any standards of conduct or governing agencies to oversee what goes on behind closed doors, it will likely run rampant until someone cries foul. For now, that means that are not only companies being manipulated but also the American public. Being swayed by the monopolisation of huge conglomerates, not only in monetary value but ideology, you have to start to wonder how much the land of the free is truly free, especially when it comes to freedom of free thinking.

Former astronaut and NFL player Leland Melvin posted this open letter to Trump on his Facebook on Sunday.
To Donald Trump
I believe in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of this country even though at the time they were drafted, their tenets of life, liberty justice for all and eventual freedom of speech, religion, assembly, press and petition amendment ratified in Dec 1791, only applied to a select group of people and not ones that looked like me. Donald Trump I listened to your Alabama rally rant and could not believe how easily you say what you say. We have become numb to your outlandish acts, tweets and recent retweet of you knocking down Hillary Clinton with a golf ball that you hit. Donald Trump your boorish and disgusting actions are not funny. They actually promote violence against women especially when your followers act out what you say.
I used to walk the grounds of UVA in Charlottesville, VA as a graduate student only to watch in horror as those same grounds became a battlefield being trod by Nazi and anti-Semitic worshippers armed with assault style weapons ready to fight to make America White again. (their words). You actually said there were nice people on both sides. People armed and ready to kill other Americans for the purpose of eradicating Blacks, Jews, Hispanics, Mexicans, Asians, Latinas and even the first real Americans, Native Americans to make America Great Again were “nice people”? Verses what you say in condemnation of an unarmed black man peacefully protesting by exercising his constitutional First Amendment rights by silently taking a knee is appalling, unnerving and reprehensible. You called Colin Kaepernick “a son-of-a-bitch.” And said he should be fired. You are basically calling his white mother a bitch. The strong contrast in language for a black man and a Nazi is very telling. Do you have any sense of decency or shame in what you say to the American people that are part of your duty to serve respectfully with dignity, presidentially?
The National Anthem that we listen too has been edited to try not to offend because when Francis Scott Key penned the song he watched freed slaves fighting for the British and wrote this stanza:
“And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion
A home and a Country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.”
I guess if I were a slave back then I probably would have done anything to obtain freedom from my American oppressors who were whipping, killing, raping, dismembering, hanging or releasing the dogs on people like me all under our Constitution. In 1814 former slaves fought with the British for their freedom from their American enslavers and Key witnessed a battle from a ship off the Maryland shore at Fort McHenry which inspired him to write what became our National Anthem.
I served my country not in the military but as 1 of 362 American Astronauts that have explored the universe to help advance our civilization. Not just Americans but all humans. I also was briefly in the NFL and stood for the National Anthem with my hand over my heart. What makes us great is our differences and respecting that we are all created equally even if not always treated that way. Looking back at our planet from space really helps one get a bigger perspective on how petty and divisive we can be. Donald Trump maybe you should ask your good friend Mr. Putin to give you a ride on a Soyuz rocket to our International Space Station and see what it’s like to work together with people we used to fight against, where your life depends on it. See the world and get a greater sense of what it means to be part of the human race, we call it the Orbital Perspective.
Donald Trump please know that you are supposed to be a unifier and a compassionate and empathetic leader. If you can’t do the job then please step down and let someone else try. I pray that you do the right thing. May God bless you.
Sincerely,
Leland Melvin

NFL Player

Trumpeter 1/32 P-51B Mustang
KIT: Trumpeter 1/32 P-51B Mustang
KIT #: 2274
PRICE: $94.00 MSRP
DECALS: Twooptions
REVIEWER: Tom Cleaver
NOTES: Small photo etch fret included.
HISTORY
Everyone "knows" that the Mustang was the airplane designed and built in 120 days for the British because North American's Dutch Kindelberger didn't want to build Curtiss P-40s under li­cense, and that the first Mustangs were a disappointment because they were hobbled by the godawful Allison engine, and that the airplane only became "good" when it was powered by the mighty Merlin. Right? That's the stuff in all the Mustang books, isn't it?
Well, yes, all that is in the "history books," many of which are written by people who prove the old saw that if you copy from one it's plagiarism, while if you copy from many it's research; and if the many have copied from each other, mistakes indeed become "facts." We are only now, sixty-odd years after the events, starting to discover that a lot of what was written as history at the outset was "uninformed" to be generous, and then was copied by those who followed, to the point that it became "the truth" because it had been repeated so many times.
Here's a truth from the horse's mouth about the origins of the Mustang: in 1981, Edgar Schmued, designer of the Mustang, came out to Chino for a 40th Anniversary celebration of his most famous work at The Air Museum, "Planes of Fame." Mr. Schmued began his career at the Bayerische Flugzeug Werke in Munich in 1934, and left in late 1937 when certain political idiots started investigating aspects of his family history. (Thank God, if World War II had to be fought, we got to fight the far right morons of the Nazi Party.) As a young engineer, Schmued had been involved in most of the detail design work that went into the creation of the Bf-109. "I was working on a fighter design of my own all that time, re­fining it with new information, waiting for an opportunity," he said. "Yes, the Mustang was built in 120 days, but I had been designing it for five years."
Furthermore, Dutch Kindelberger knew about Schmued's filing cabinet full of drawings, and had a strong hunch they had a pretty good design, at the time he turned down the British offer to fund North American's license production of the P-40, an airplane Kindelberger correctly saw as being at the end of its development cycle. It might have been a fight to turn the drawings into blueprints and the blueprints into a metal airplane inside 120 days, but North American was not starting with "clean paper" as everyone has believed all these years since.
While the Allison-powered Mustang was a world-beater at low altitude, the design really came into its own and became the best piston-engine fighter of the Second World War when the RAF tested three Mustang I airframes fitted with the Merlin engine, which North American then refined into what became the P-51B. Putting the best airframe available together with the best engine available created an airplane that swept through the opposition like a scythe wherever it was deployed. When the first merlin-powered Mustangs appeared over Berlin on march 6, 1944, Hermann Goering later testified at Nuremberg that “I knew the jig was up.”
THE KIT
Revell released a 1/32 P-51B thirty-some years ago that has been in and out of production over the years and of which the less said, the better; the model is unfixably wrong for those who worry about such minor points as overall shape accuracy and such. Jerry Rutman released a P-51B all-resin kit that is still available and is still the most accurate P-51 in 1/32. 21st Century Toys has announced the release of a 1/32 P-51B in their line of inexpensive “kits” derived from their more widely-released pre-painted, pre-assembled toys, which looks to be as good quality-wise as their Macchi C.202 and Messerschmitt Bf-109 kits, with what is promised to be an excellent and wide-ranging decal sheet.
When I first heard Trumpeter’s announcement that they would release a 1/32 P-51B, my first thought was I hoped they didn’t pantograph down their hopelessly-mangled P-51D as the basis of the new kit. When test shot pictures appeared at IPMS Philippines, that fear was set to rest with the revelation this was a completely new-mold design. Rumblings were heard, however, among those “Mustang fanatics” that the kit had its share of problems. Having just completed both the excellent P-47 Thunderbolt and the “lacking” F6F-5 Hellcat, I was hoping for something closer to the P-47 when I opened the big sturdy Trumpeter box and took a look inside.
What I found was, sadly, closer to the Hellcat.
The Good:
The overall shape accuracy of the kit is good, among the best of any P-51 kit on the market. The coffin-lid canopy is right. The prop blades are right (a big plus when compared to the 1/32 P-51 kit from another Chinese manufacturer that I failed to review a year ago after trashing it). The 75-gallon metal tanks and 108-gallon paper tanks (which come from the P-47 kit) are good. The rivet/divot surface detail is not so annoying that it won’t look acceptable under paint, as proved to be the case with the P-47 and the Me-262 kits. The photo-etch seatbelts reveal that Trumpeter bought some of Eduard’s new 1/32 seat belts, studied them closely and made a “Chinese copy” - a good idea.
The Bad:
The overall problem with the kit is that Trumpeter couldn’t decide if they were doing a P-51B or a P-51D - given that they are soon to release a P-51D, it is obvious they wanted to have as much commonality of parts as possible. Unfortunately, they did not get the fact that many of the details of a P-5 1B are completely unlike a P-51D and cannot be made common no matter how hard one tries, at least not if accuracy of the kit is any criteria in the design.
The gear wells are the usual mythological creation that dogs all P-51 kits in any scale other than Jerry Rutman’s P-51B. The rear “wall” of the outer gear well does not follow the forward sweep of the gear opening, as it does here. In 1/32 scale, the way Trumpeter has molded this area, a modeler who wants to correct this can do it with a minimum of hassle with Evergreen sheet. More problematic is the fact that the main gear wheel doors are just “off” in shape, and that the outer doors are P-51D doors - which are noticeably wider in chord than the doors of the P-51B and the Allison Mustangs. Additionally, these doors are “off” in overall shape in a way not easily fixed without some Evergreen sheet and modification of the gear well opening in the wing along with straightening the rear spar. Most people likely won’t worry about this, but the modeler who thinks of the P-51 the way other modelers think of the Bf-109, the Fw-190 or the Spitfire, is going to be “miffed” to say the least.
The kit has the formation lights in the outer right wing that is correct for a P-51D and wrong for a P-51B. This can be fixed with an application of Mr. Surfacer, a few minutes with a sanding stick, and a pounce wheel to put in the rivets in that area.
There are no shell ejection chutes for the wing guns. This is something easily fixed with a #11 X-acto and “some modeling skill required” along with a small modeling file, but it still seems strange that this would be missed.
The exhaust stacks are single pieces, and do not include the cover commonly used on the majority of Mustangs. The modeler will have to at least assemble the basic engine and mounts, to have something to attach the exhaust stacks to. The only way to get the other kind of exhausts would be to rob a Dragon kit (one could trade stacks I suppose).
The wings are not a laminar cross-section, which most people will not notice, but some will look at the final result and wonder why it is that the upper wing/fuselage joint looks “off” to them.
Like most Trumpeter kits, this one is over-engineered, with lots of parts that will end up staying in the box since they depict areas of the model that can’t be seen without cutting the model open. However, those who want to do that kind of model will be happy with the basic materials provided here to start that kind of project.
The Ugly:
The decals suck. They are worthless (unless one lives in a town that doesn’t have 24-hour stores and happens to run out of a certain valuable paper product in the bathroom in the middle of the night). Once again, Trumpeter seems to find it impossible to get the proportions right on U.S. National Insignia. The font and colors of “Ding Hao!” and the scoreboard for this airplane are wrong. The tail checkerboard decals for the other option reveal that Trumpeter failed to take a look at any photograph of a 325th FG “Checkertail” to see how the checkers were applied, and as a result has these completely wrong. The good news here is that there are previously-released 1/32 P-51B decals from SuperScale, Aeromaster and CAM (which did a perfect sheet for “Ding Hao!”) that can be found at collector’s tables and will likely be re-released. There is also that 21st Century Toys sheet out there.
The cockpit bears no relationship to any cockpit in any Mustang of any sub-type, ever. The instrument panel is a P-51D panel by shape, with an insert that tries to put the individual instruments in a “P-51B-like pattern.” The seat and the armor backing are bastardizations of a P-51D seat and armor. The side panels are for the P-51D, with a few that never existed on any P-51 thrown in for good measure. The floor is curved, like the Allison-Mustang floor (and looks to be the floor that will be in the P-51D, given the P-51D side panels). The kit also offers the option of a British “spade grip” control stick which no Mustang ever used.
But the piece de resistance is a “rear bulkhead” just behind the seat that COMPLETELY cuts off the cockpit from the rear area with the tank and the scalloped rear windows. Where this bit of fantasy came from I have no idea.
The “Malcolm Hood” the kit provides looks like the original only in side profile, since it is not “blown” in any way.
The only good news I can see here immediately is that Jerry Rutman might take pity on modelers and sell the cockpit parts for his very good kit, which would give an accurate P-51B cockpit - which is the most vital part of the model and the area in the most need of rescuing. Other aftermarket companies will also likely ride to the rescue here.
CONCLUSIONS
I did manage to resist the urge to close the box, take it out in the back yard, pretend it was a soccer ball and “bend it like Beckham.” Unlike the Dragon collection of scrap plastic in a box masquerading as a P-51 kit, most of what is wrong here can be fixed, and is not so crucial that less-demanding modelers won’t have models in their collection they’re unhappy with - provided they get an aftermarket decal sheet. The coming 21st Century Toys kit will be modestly priced to the point it can be viewed as a collection of alternative parts and decals to get this kit right.
But coming after the very nice P-47 and F-100, and arriving in the same shipping box with the very, very nice Me-262B-1a kit (that’s another review) - a comparison was easily invited between “got it right” and “close, but no cigar” - the kit registers as an overall disappointment. It won’t be in the “to do” pile until I can get a good resin cockpit and a worthwhile set of decals.
As with the P-51D, the modeling world still awaits a really good P-51B in 1/32 scale for the average modeler to feel comfortable doing - though Jerry Rutman’s P-51B is very good and completely competitive price-wise with this kit, for the modeler unafraid of attempting a full-resin short-run kit.
Bottom line: you can, with effort, create a nice model from this kit. But - for $94 - you should be able to create a nicer one.
Thanks to Stevens International for the review copy.

Four Tips For New York Metro Couples To Make Money and Marriage Work Together
by Allan J. Rolnick
It seems like crooks these days keep finding new ways to trick people here in New York Metro into giving them more money.
And no, I’m not talking about Congress.
Last week, for those of us in the tax professional world in New York Metro who are paying attention (because let’s be honest — many of our colleagues are still on vacation), we got bombarded by the official IRS channels and other such voices that there is a new scam afoot. Essentially, the thieves are now “spoofing” the numbers they are calling from so that the incoming call seems as if it is originating from an actual IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center. And then, if the taxpayer questions them, they direct you to IRS.gov to look up the local TAC office phone number to verify. They then hang up, and call back a second time — now armed with the taxpayer’s trust.
Allow me to remind you: IRS employees at TAC offices do not make calls to taxpayers to demand payment of overdue tax bills. There are certain instances when the IRS does call a taxpayer, but never before sending multiple notices in the mail.
Don’t give in to threats, and don’t fall for this one.
Now then … May is here. And the season is definitely shifting.
In fact, I do believe we are headed into wedding season here in New York Metro.
And the fact is, an overwhelming number of failed marriages from New York Metro cite financial troubles as a major factor in their breakup. As sad as this is, it really shouldn’t be too much of a surprise, because the way we use our time and money reflects our values.
And, of course, without a strong set of shared values around money and marriage, marriages drift apart. But I’ve seen how dealing with finances together can actually bring a couple closer — not farther apart.
But it matters how you approach it. Here are some thoughts, heading into this wedding season. Perhaps they would be useful for a young couple in your life… (or maybe you!)
Four Tips For New York Metro Couples To Make Money and Marriage Work Together
“The only way to have a friend is to be one.” -Ralph Waldo Emerson
Many young couples start out married life without a clear idea of how to handle their finances — leading to stress, arguments, and long-term marital problems.
And correspondingly, there are some couples for whom finances have become a painful wedge. So, though I don’t fashion myself to be a “marriage expert”, I have seen many financial partnerships work well … and more than I’d like, of those that didn’t.
Here are some ideas for you, as well as a little gift idea at the end.
1. Don’t avoid the hard stuff.
Whether you are in a pre-marriage stage, or are already working through your partnership, it’s crucially important to learn the skill of conversation about finances. There can be so much mental anguish over shame, fear, and past pain that unhealthy communication patterns begin to emerge.
So give yourselves the gift of honesty, and make a list of hard topics that you can tackle over time.
As an example, many couples from New York Metro are afraid to talk about the three D’s: debt, death, and disability. Take time to discuss these fears instead of avoiding them. Planning will help you both feel better.
2. Talk through your different money backgrounds.
How we were raised has an enormous effect on how we deal with money. Depending on what your home was like as a child, you likely heard many different attitudes expressed around the dinner table, and they have undoubtedly shaped your financial paradigm as an adult. Whether from poverty, or from abundance, your background is extremely powerful.
So, if your money attitude differs from your spouse’s, talk about how you were raised and work toward a compromise where you can strengthen each other’s weaknesses.
3. Put yourself in each other’s shoes.
If one of you usually pays all the bills, switch for a couple of months. You or your partner may get a crash course on how much running the household actually costs. Keep track of all spending for at least one billing cycle (usually one month) to actually see where your money is going, and decide which expenditures can be decreased or eliminated. You might even find opportunities to give.
4. Maintain (small) independence.
A joint checking account is useful, but maintain some kind of separate amount of money as a “slush fund” of sorts, whereby you can each make purchases without mutual consent. Keep these amounts small (you always want partnership in the big amounts), but a sense of independence (however symbolic) will help both of you feel you have equal footing in the relationship, even if you have a big difference in salaries.
5. Work together to build something financial.
Find a way to work together on a small, money-related project, whether playing the stock market or saving towards some small goal. Pick something that doesn’t carry emotional weight, and see it as an exercise. You’ll find that working together in a small way will help you in a BIG way, as your decisions become more significant.
6. Agree together that you won’t lose on your taxes.
Obviously, this is what we are here for, and perhaps one of the best gifts you can give yourselves is a workable plan as it relates to a tax strategy.
And maybe the best place to start is to make sure that your taxes were handled properly.
Warmly,
Allan Rolnick

Can The Republicans Replace Obamacare Before The Next Election?
Yes. They could do it. But only if they accept two principles:
All the Obamacare money must be used for health care – it can’t be used to cut taxes for the rich or for special interests.
There must be a clear and sustainable path to lower premiums and better access to care.

The Trump Plan To Reduce Prescription Drug Prices Will Have A Major Impact
On Friday, the administration released a 44-page blueprint for executive action on drug pricing entitled “American Patients First.” The blueprint represents the most comprehensive, serious, and thorough effort by any presidential administration to address the problem of high prescription drug prices.The Trump plan involves two categories of reform: things the administration can do unilaterally, and things that it will call on Congress to enact. Friday’s release focused mainly on unilateral actions, but the Congressional piece is arguably more important, and has gone underappreciated by many observers.

Insurers Figured Out How to Make a Profit From Obamacare Last Year
After years of losses, the U.S. health insurance industry figured out how make money from Obamacare last year, a new analysis shows.
The secret? Raising their prices.
The average cost of health insurance plans sold in the individual market climbed about 22 percent in 2017, as insurers boosted premiums well above what they spent on medical care. That left many in a profitable position for the first time since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report released Thursday.

Great Britain Offers Cautionary Tale on Single-Payer
First Charlie Gard and now Alfie Evans. These are babies who, though verbally silent, still gave clarion warnings to proponents of single-payer health care: The government — not my parents — is in charge of my life.
Charlie Gard was born in August 2015 with a rare genetic disorder that carried a poor long-term prognosis. In July 2017, little Charlie was just 23 months of age and on a ventilator. Over the objections of his parents, British doctors decided to withdraw life-sustaining care. According to British Courts, the National Health Service (NHS), the country’s single-payer system, is the ultimate medical decision maker — not the family. Ventilator support was withdrawn and Charlie died.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday he is working on a new version of his ObamaCare repeal-and-replace bill and has not given up on efforts to do away with the law despite Republicans’ failure last year. “I haven’t given up,” Graham said. “Will there be another effort to replace ObamaCare with a state-centric plan? I hope so.”
The effort appears to have little, if any, chance of passing this year. Republican leadership has made clear that it has moved on from the ObamaCare repeal effort, and the GOP has an even slimmer margin in the Senate than they did last year when they failed to win enough votes for a bill.

Oregon Insurers Propose Modest Obamacare Rate Increases
Oregon’s seven Obamacare insurers are asking for an average nearly 8 percent rate increase for 2019, with some plans calling for hikes of as much as 16 percent.
Of the seven insurers selling plans on the individual market and the law’s exchanges, six plan on raising rates next year between 5 percent and 16 percent. The other insurer aims to reduce rates by nearly 10 percent. Insurers that are proposing rate increases point to the repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty in 2019 as a reason.
The news comes as Democrats and Obamacare allies are attempting to tie the GOP to any rate increases because of changes the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress have made to the law.

Democrats Run on GOP Health Care ‘Sabotage’
Democrats are confidently running on Obamacare for the first time in a decade.
They’ve got a unified message blaming Republicans for “sabotaging” the health care law, leading to a cascade of sky-high insurance premiums that will come just before the November midterm elections. They’re rolling out ads featuring people helped by the law. And Tuesday, they’re starting a campaign to amplify each state’s premium increases — and tie those to GOP decisions.

Why Are 28 Million Able-Bodied Adults on Medicaid? Expanded Work Requirements Could Help Fix That
Medicaid has made major headlines over the last year and for good reason. The welfare program originally intended to provide medical assistance to poor children, seniors and individuals with disabilities has expanded to include more and more able-bodied adults.

New York and Minnesota officials have settled a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its decision to slash federal funding for the states’ health plan programs that cover certain low-income people.
A federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the case after the HHS agreed to pay $151.9 million to New York and $17.3 million to Minnesota by May 14 to fund the states’ Basic Health Programs, which together cover 800,000 people.

GOP Senator Calls for Mandatory Medicaid Work Requirements
Republican Sen. John Kennedy (La.) on Thursday said Medicaid work requirements should be mandatory for states, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) should take the lead to make it happen.
During a hearing on the HHS budget, Kennedy said many Medicaid beneficiaries who aren’t working “would like to know the dignity of work” noting he would like to see HHS work with Congress to put together a program that would institute a mandatory requirement that Medicaid beneficiaries work 20 hours a week.

Reverse Mortgage Rates and Fees For Sheridan
April 15, 2018 /
Searching For Great Rates and Fees For Reverse Mortgages In Sheridan Oregon? Here Are The Things You Need To Understand About Interest Rates and Fees For Reverse Mortgage Loans.
Reverse Mortgage Rates in Sheridan OR
Not only will reverse mortgage interest rates in Sheridan vary from lender to lender. Rates will also vary depending on the loan product you choose to utilize. Here is a general guide on shopping for the best rate on a reverse mortgage in Sheridan.
1. Fixed Rate Reverse Mortgage Sheridan – Typically this will have the highest interest rate of all the options you have available. However, it also comes with the least amount of risk as you know exactly how much you will owe on the loan at anytime in the future. The down side to the fixed rate is that you are limited to the amount of equity you can gain access too. Typically the fixed rate loan is used when the reverse mortgage is being used to purchase a home or there is very little or no equity available after paying off the current liens against the property. With the fixed rate option you get a lump sum of cash and that is it.
2. Annual Adjustable Rate Reverse Mortgage Sheridan – Typically this will have the lowest interest rate available. This loan option has caps on the amount the interest rate can rise per annual adjustment and for the life of the loan. Most annual reverse mortgage ARM’s can adjust one time per year and are capped at a maximum adjustment of 2% up or down. They is also a cap rate of 5% above the start rate, this is the highest the rate can adjust. For example, if your start rate was 4% the highest it could ever go would be 9%.
If you have substantial equity or your Sheridan home is paid off. The annual adjustable rate usually makes the most sense. This is because their are multiple ways to gain access to your homes equity. These options include:
Tenure: equal monthly payments
Term: equal monthly payments for a fixed period of months as decided by the borrower
Line of Credit: payments made in installments or at various times and in amounts dictated by the borrower(s)
Modified Tenure: monthly payments with a line of credit
Modified Term: monthly payments for a fixed period of months with a line of credit
3. Monthly Adjustable Rate Reverse Mortgage in Sheridan – This interest rate option can be all over the board. It could be lower, the same or higher and the fixes rate and adjustable rate. It all really depends on who you are getting your loan through. However, most people never take this option due to the risks associated with it.
Much like the annual ARM the monthly ARM has cap rates as well. The monthly can adjust on a monthly basis and is capped at no more than a 2% adjustment up or down. The lifetime cap rate is 10% above the start rate. For example if the start rate was 4.5% the highest it could ever go would be 14.5%.
Reverse Mortgage Fees in Sheridan OR
You can pay for most of the costs of a reverse mortgage in Sheridan by financing them and having them paid from the proceeds of the loan. Financing the costs means that you do not have to pay for them out of your pocket. On the other hand, financing the costs reduces the net loan amount available to you.
The reverse mortgage loan includes several fees and charges, which includes: 1) mortgage insurance premiums (initial and annual) 2) third party charges 3) origination fee 4) interest and 5) servicing fees. The lender will discuss which fees and charges are mandatory.
You will be charged an initial mortgage insurance premium (MIP) at closing. The initial MIP will be 2% of the max claim amount. Over the life of the loan, you will be charged an annual MIP that equals 0.5% of the outstanding mortgage balance.
Mortgage Insurance Premium
You will incur a cost for FHA mortgage insurance. The mortgage insurance guarantees that you will receive expected loan advances. You can finance the mortgage insurance premium (MIP) as part of your loan.
Third Party Charges
Closing costs from third parties can include an appraisal, title search and insurance, surveys, inspections, recording fees, mortgage taxes, credit checks and other fees.
Origination Fee
You will pay an origination fee to compensate the lender for processing your HECM loan. A lender can charge the greater of $2,500 or 2% of the first $200,000 of your home’s value plus 1% of the amount over $200,000. Reverse mortgage origination fees in Sheridan are capped at $6,000.
Servicing Fee
Lenders or their agents provide servicing throughout the life of the reverse mortgage. Servicing includes sending you account statements, disbursing loan proceeds and making certain that you keep up with loan requirements such as paying real estate taxes and hazard insurance premium.Lenders may charge a monthly servicing fee of no more than $30 if the loan has an annually adjusting interest rate or has a fixed interest rate. The lender may charge a monthly servicing fee of no more than $35 if the interest rate adjusts monthly. At loan closing, the lender sets aside the servicing fee and deducts the fee from your available funds. Each month the monthly servicing fee is added to your loan balance. Lenders may also choose to include the servicing fee in the mortgage interest rate.Servicing fees are not required. Some reverse mortgage lenders will charge them others will not. Some lenders may reduce their origination fee if you opt for the servicing fee. In other words, you may want to shop around to see if you can avoid paying the servicing fee.
In order to get the best reverse mortgage rates in Sheridan you need to shop around. No one single lender or loan officer has the best interest rates at any given time regardless of what they tell you. The same goes for reverse mortgage loan fees as well. In order to pay the lowest reverse mortgage fees in Sheridan you need to shop around and do lots of comparisons.

Hillary Almost Proposed “A Universal Basic Income” In 2016; Now The Idea Is Catching On Among Grassroots Democrats : So Let Me See, Work 8 Hours A Day Or Play Video Games?

Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,
Should you get free money from the U.S. government every month simply for being alive?
That may sound like a crazy idea to many of us, but the truth is that this will likely be one of the biggest political issues in the 2020 presidential election.
At this point, 40 percent of all Americans already “prefer socialism to capitalism”, and the concept of a “universal basic income” is starting to catch fire among grassroots Democrats.
Many liberals are convinced that the time has come to fight for the right to “a minimum standard of living”, and one study by a “left-leaning” group found that giving every adult in the country $1,000 each month would increase the size of the U.S. economy by more than 2 trillion dollars…
Giving every adult in the United States a $1,000 cash handout per month would grow the economy by $2.5 trillion by 2025, according to a new study on universal basic income.
The report was released in August by the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute. Roosevelt research director Marshall Steinbaum, Michalis Nikiforos at Bard College’s Levy Institute, and Gennaro Zezza at the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio in Italy co-authored the study.
What an incredible idea, eh?
All we have to do is give out free stuff and the economy grows like magic. And the study also discovered that the larger the universal basic income is, the more the economy would grow.
So why not make it $10,000 a month for everyone?
Well, it turns out that there is a catch. According to the study, the economy only grows if the universal basic income is funded by deficit spending. If we have to raise taxes to pay for it, there is no positive benefit to the economy at all…
These estimates are based on a universal basic income paid for by increasing the federal deficit. As part of the study, the researchers also calculated the effect to the economy of paying for the cash handouts by increasing taxes. In that case, there would be no net benefit to the economy, the report finds.
Oh.
What a bummer.
Getting free stuff from the government always sounds like a great idea until you realize that we are going to end up paying for it one way or another.
Unfortunately, that little detail isn’t stopping potential Democratic presidential candidates such as Mark Zuckerberg from “exploring” the idea.
And actually, it is being reported that Hillary Clinton almost made a “universal basic income” part of her platform in 2016…
In her new book “What Happened,” and in a recent subsequent interview with Vox Editor-in-Chief Ezra Klein, Clinton explains how she seriously considered including a version of universal basic income — a radical solution to poverty, currently being tested in cities and countries around the world — as one of her platforms in the 2016 US presidential election.
The platform would have been called “Alaska for America,” in homage to the state’s Permanent Dividend Fund. Every year since 1982, Alaskans have received a yearly check — typically ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 — as a kickback from the pot of money that has been set aside in case oil reserves dry up.
If the left is ever able to get this implemented, do you think that we will ever be able to take it away?
Over time, government just keeps getting bigger and bigger and so does our national debt. In fact, we just hit a major milestone in that regard. According to CNS News, we just surpassed the 20 trillion dollar mark for the first time ever…
The federal debt officially surpassed $20 trillion for the first time on Friday, as the debt subject to the legal limit set by Congress jumped $317,645,000,000 in one day–following President Donald Trump’s signing of a spending-and-debt-limit deal that will fund the government through Dec. 8.
If the left wants a “universal basic income”, they are going to have to get the money from somewhere. Our budget deficit is already larger “than the entire GDP of Argentina”, and hard working Americans are already being taxed to death.
The truth is that the money simply isn’t there. As it is, we need to dramatically cut back our borrowing because the path that we are currently on leads to national suicide. Just consider the following numbers…
Here’s the problem: the national debt is growing MUCH faster than the US economy. In Fiscal Year 2016, for example, the debt grew by 7.84%.
Yet even when including the ‘benefits’ of inflation, the US economy only grew by 2.4% over the same period.
This is not even close to the realm of being sustainable. We are steamrolling toward an inevitable financial collapse, and yet most Americans don’t seem to care.
And thanks to our rapidly aging population, our entitlement spending is set to absolutely explode in coming years. The following comes from David Stockman…
The Federal spending machine is almost entirely on autopilot and heading for disaster owing to ballooning populations and debt. Ten years from now the combined cost of mandatory programs and debt service will reach $5.12 trillion compared to just $2.87 trillion during FY 2018.
Entitlement spending will be nearly double — even if Congress took a 10-year recess!
As shown below, that means the Federal spending share of GDP is now inexorably climbing toward 30% owing to baby boom retirements, even as revenue under current law is stuck at about 18% of GDP. The CBO’s latest projection of the widening fiscal gap — soon more than 10% of GDP annually — leaves nothing to the imagination.
There is no such thing as “free money”. In the end, we all have to pay for any “free stuff” that the government gives out.
But the “free stuff army” is going to continue to demand more free stuff from the government, and the Democrats are going to be more than happy to give it to them.
To many of you this may sound like complete and utter insanity, but the truth is that the path that we are already on is completely insane as well. If we don’t find a way to right the ship, it is just a matter of time before it goes under, and anyone that tries to tell you otherwise is not being straight with you.

Journey Into the Unknown: Symphony Tacoma Presents a Trio of Titans
Posted on March 22, 2018 by sarahioa
By Christian Carvajal of the Weekly Volcano
Symphony Tacoma will present Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 10” this Sunday alongside Brahms’ Symphony No. 1, which was written in conscious homage to Beethoven’s Ninth, and a Haydn concerto that highlights the talents of principal trumpeter Charles Butler. “This seemed just the right timing and program to feature (Butler),” said Ioannides, “who has had an incredibly wonderful career, formerly also the principal of Seattle Symphony.” Butler, who began his career with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, is the principal trumpeter for Portland Opera and a substitute for Oregon Ballet Theater and Pacific Northwest Ballet.
“Everybody will take away different meaningful moments,” Ioannides says of an upcoming Tacoma rendition. “I always recommend to a listener, when you hear something for the first time, to lose any sense of expectations and … allow it to take you on a journey into the unknown. … Look for the beauty of contrast. Look for the complexity of polyphonic lines … Follow the peaks and valleys, as you would exploring any new landscape.”

UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT Viktor Yanukovych appears to have been driven from power after the mass protest movement that has occupied Kiev's Maidan (Independence Square) since November survived a deadly crackdown last week. In a matter of days, the country's corrupt and autocratic regime was overwhelmed.
The parliamentary opposition to Yanukovych--dominated by center-right and even far-right parties, backed by the European Union (EU) and U.S. government--is moving quickly to establish its authority, ahead of new elections planned for May. Their goal is to head off any further action from below that might undermine their claim to speak for the uprising--and that might target the country's elite beyond Yanukovych and his ruling party.
Contrary to this aim, however, the Maidan occupation grew larger over the weekend as masses of people celebrated reports that Yanukovych had fled the capital late Friday night. In scenes reminiscent of insurrections past, demonstrators poured into Yanukovych's abandoned private estate in Kiev, complete with a luxurious residence, zoo and carefully manicured golf course.
A dense crowd of protesters fill the streets beyond a barricade in Kiev (Christiaan Triebert)
The masses of people who participated in the Maidan movement did not endure months of encampments during a frigid winter and repeated assaults by the regime's riot police in order for a new political leadership to take charge and preside over the same neoliberal policies that have impoverished ordinary people. Whatever happens now, the memory of how mass resistance forced out a tyranny will stay burned in the minds of Ukrainians.
Nevertheless, at this point, the conservative, pro-Western parties that have claimed leadership of the movement are pressing their advantage.
As a consequence of the upheaval last week, Yulia Tymoshenko, the imprisoned leader of the opposition Fatherland Party, was freed from jail. The Western media showcased a sympathetic image of Tymoshenko, frail from years behind bars and speaking to 50,000 people in Maidan. But more honest reports noted she got a "cool reception" from the occupiers. According to the Wall Street Journal, a volunteer security officer admonished her, saying: "Yulia Vladimirovna, remember who made this revolution."
Tymoshenko herself is no stranger to political power or corruption--she is a former prime minister, and she became one of the richest people in Ukraine by brokering insider deals in the energy industry. Other leading figures of the former opposition parties have similar backgrounds.
Equally menacing is the high profile of the far right--in the form of both Svoboda, a political party with representatives in parliament that has ties to the British National Party and France's National Front; and the extra-parliamentary Right Sector, a tightly organized street force that reportedly took the lead in the confrontations with riot police when the crackdown came last week.
The far right doesn't care about democratic rights or challenging the power of the wealthy oligarchs--any more than Yanukovych did, or the more conventional conservative parties that have taken control in parliament.
THE MAIDAN occupation was sparked off in November by the announcement that the Yanukovych government was rejecting a proposed "association agreement" with the EU, apparently in order to join the Eurasian Customs Union, led by Vladimir Putin's Russia.
The center-right parties that dominated the speakers' platform in Maidan continued to portray themselves as pro-Europe, and the widespread desire for a break with Russia has been a factor throughout. But other issues quickly gained in prominence--the impoverished conditions for the majority of the population, in contrast to the incredible wealth of the oligarchs; the corruption of the Yanukovych regime; and pro-democracy demands against the state's harsh repression.
Yanukovych attempted to balance between promises of change and threats of imprisonment and worse for demonstrators--all while struggling to maintain the support of the wealthy elite. But each time Yanukovych ordered repression, the riot police were repelled, though at the cost of scores of people killed.
The conflict reached a new pitch on Tuesday, February 18, following the announcement of the resumption of Russian aid to Ukraine. The government unleashed the most violent crackdown yet on protesters. After 36 hours of intense battles that left more than two dozen people dead and hundreds injured, a truce was announced on Wednesday night.
But events had spiraled beyond the control of the regime. The seizure of government offices in western Ukraine began to spread, while members of parliament from Yanukovych's ruling Party of Regions started defecting, along with the mayor of Kiev.
The truce was shattered the next morning, and acting Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko announced he had authorized police to be equipped with Kalashnikovs and sniper rifles. Security forces and the now armed self-defense units of the Maidan fought pitched battles, using live ammunition--news footage showed downtown Kiev transformed into a war zone.
This was the setting for Yanukovych, having announced another "agreement" with opposition parties, to flee Kiev for the east of the country, where he has his political base of support, close to the border with Russia. Other political officials followed his lead and fled, or defected to the Maidan opposition. Security forces abandoned the fight in Kiev, and the numbers in the square swelled, demanding that the police chiefs responsible for the deaths of protesters be held accountable.
Because of the defections, the trio of conservative and far right opposition parties achieved a majority in parliament and voted unanimously to return to the 2004 constitution, which grants parliament greater powers. Over the weekend, votes were taken to impeach Yanukovych and to hand over his powers to the speaker of parliament, Aleksandr Turchinov, who is now acting president.
What will happen is far from clear, but there is a real possibility that Ukraine could break apart. The last week's upheavals has accelerated the process of western cities and regions, beginning last week with the city of Lviv, shaking off the control of the central government in Kiev. Meanwhile, in the Eastern city of Kharkiv, a congress of the country's Southern and Eastern regions passed a resolution last Saturday rejecting the authority of the now-opposition-controlled parliament in Kiev.
THE POLITICAL forces poised to take control of Ukraine after Yanukovych's fall aren't looking out for workers, in any way, shape or form. As a statement from the anarchist Autonomous Workers Union of Ukraine bluntly put it:
Besides the fascists, old and experienced Oppositionists will also attempt to seize power. Many of them already have some experience with working in government, and they are no strangers to corruption, favoritism and the use of budget funds for personal purposes.
As Russian socialist Ilya Budraitskis explained in an interview with the German magazine Marx21, the wealthy elite "has influence not only on the economy and society, but also has direct control over one or more political parties. An oligarch can therefore translate their finance capital into direct political power."
Yulia Tymoshenko is a creature of this system. She played a leading role in Ukraine's 2004 "Orange Revolution," when mass protest against a stolen election succeeded in overturning the result. Tymoshenko became prime minister under President Viktor Yushchenko, who was widely seen as a pro-Western reformer. But Yushchenko failed to reverse Ukraine's economic inequality or democratize the political system. Disillusionment with him paved the way for Yanyukovich and his party to make a comeback six years later.
Before 2004, Tymoshenko first rose to prominence as the head of an energy company following the breakup of the old USSR in 1991 and the declaration of an independent Ukraine--she proved a savvy operator in the new era of privatization and free-market "reform." She and the other leaders of the parties now in control in Kiev are no more concerned today about the economic and social needs of ordinary Ukrainians--their negotiations with the EU so far have been focused on opening up Ukraine's market to EU businesses.
A government led by Tymoshenko's Fatherland Party will lead to a deepening of neoliberal measures, only this time with international connections to the EU and International Monetary Fund, rather than Putin's Russia. Indeed, some on the left are already calling this prospect a "Second Orange Revolution"--in recognition that it is bound to disappoint the hopes of the wider layers of people that brought them to power.
ANOTHER THREAT to working people in Ukraine comes in the form of the far right.
The influence and perceived respectability of the right in the Maidan movement needs to be understood in its political and historical context. Liberalism, as one might understand it from the U.S. context, does not exist as an independent force in Ukraine. Instead, the political landscape is composed of various shades of conservative populist parties.
At the website LeftEast, Ovidiu Tichindeleanu explained that "popular movements have exploded all throughout Eastern Europe [in the last three years], and all expressed an anti-systemic discontent." But because these movements "failed to produce a common constitutional moment," Tichindeleanu argues, many of them, "whether from Ukraine or Romania, have come to be dominated or marred by nationalists and the far right."
The size and influence of fascist forces in the Maidan movement is frightening. For example, members of the Antifascist Union Ukraine estimated in an interview that extreme right-wing nationalists made up about 30 percent of protesters.
Among the fighting forces that defended Maidan against the crackdown--and that now guard parliament, instead of the state police--the Right Sector, with its highly coordinated organization and disciplined command structure, is in strict control, even preventing left-wing attempts to organize defense groups.
Right Sector was increasingly at the forefront of the clashes with government forces, but its aims are not at all in conflict with those truly in power in Ukraine. In the midst of the most intense battles last week, for example, Right Sector issued an appeal to the oligarchs around Yanukovych, asking them to support the protests and the formation of a government led by technocrats. Fascists have always relied on the backing of big capital to come to power--their appeal should be seen as a bid to build relations with the ruling class.
The menace of the far right in Ukraine cannot be understated. But it would be wrong to dismiss the protest movement wholesale because its presence.
The fascists won't be stopped by shoring up the repressive state apparatus around the oligarchs. On the contrary, the capitalist state typically uses such opportunities to limit the democratic rights of ordinary people, and especially to ramp up the repression of the left, thereby creating even more favorable conditions for the far right to grow.
Confronting the threat of fascism will require a grassroots effort involving independent workers' organizations, trade unions and a strengthened left establishing an atmosphere of solidarity within the Maidan, in which the toxic message of hate will whither and die.
PRIOR TO the crackdown on February 18, the socialist left, though small and not well organized, was gaining a hearing in the Maidan, according to reports. According to Zakhar Popovych, a member of Left Opposition, thousands of copies of the "Ten Theses of the Left Opposition in Ukraine" had been distributed and discussed among demonstrators.
Unfortunately, whatever progress the left had been making was largely disrupted by the crackdowns. The left in Ukraine remains very small, as one sober report from before the crackdown put it, with "no organization that can carry out planned strategic activities, nor media resources able to communicate to our position to the public, nor sufficient research capacity able to competently analyze our activities."
At the same time, however, the development of the Maidan movement was leading to a shift in the class composition of the demonstrations. Writing before the crackdown, a member of the Autonomous Workers Union reported that:
the protesters [initially] were mainly students and urban "middle classes": petite bourgeoisie, bohemian circles, office workers. Right now, the class composition of the protests has definitely shifted to the more universal one. I'm not sure about the exact proportions, but it's doubtless that the protest has become more "proletarian"--although the share of workers is still low, and when they are present, they are there as "Ukrainians" or "citizens," not as "workers."
At the front of the Maidan, leaders of center-right parties dominated the speakers' platform, and the far right controlled its self-defense units. But a large majority of the rank-and-file participants in the Maidan have legitimate grievances--against the impact of neoliberal capitalism, against state repression and their lack of a political voice, against endemic corruption that ultimately serves to amass more wealth for the oligarchs--which put them at odds with both the mainstream right and the far right.
Building on the basis of these grievances, around the principle of solidarity, offers the hope for confronting both the agenda of a new government led by the mainstream conservative parties and the threat of a further growth in influence for the fascists--and for creating the conditions for the emergence of a future revolutionary movement.

WAR $$ VOTES
I am running out the door and will make this quick. Yesterday the House of Unrepresentatives voted 336-87 to pass the 2012 Pentagon Appropriations bill that will fork another $649 billion into endless war. Of the 336 votes in favor were 112 Democrats. Only 75 Dems voted against the bill (including both our representatives from Maine). Many members of the Congress Progressive Caucus voted in favor of the military spending bill. They are the same people complaining about cuts in social spending. You can see how your member of Congress voted by clicking here
I heard yesterday that the City Council of Los Angeles, California has voted in favor of the Bring Our War $$ Home resolution. Good news there.

BREAKING NEWS FROM JEJU ISLAND
Famous South Korean Catholic priest Father Moon arrives in Gangjeong village on Jeju Island on a new scooter given to him by the nation's head bishop.
Latest news from an activist in Gangjeong village:
Yesterday the Republic of Korea's defense minister pushed the prime minister to accelerate the heavily dangerous construction of the Gangjeong naval base.
As you may know that military base is meant to be one of the main center of weaponry deployment in all Asia and Pacific…
Today we, activists struggling within the construction zone, faced three strong attacks led by the Korean-US government:
1. The national government is on his on way to cut the local electrical power lines that help us to broadcast the situation to all of you internationally.
2. The destruction of the touristic lovely trail that pass in our resistance camp, in front of the construction site has been announced.
3. Articles have been published today in several famous national newspapers, dishonestly qualifying us as "a bunch of dangerous pro-North Korean government communists". National media brainwashing... Here, there is no so-called dangerous people, among us Gangjeong activists, but only conscious beings that work for peace.
Soon the trial of 8 of our most devoted and influential activists will start (15th of July), they are accused of obstructing the military construction works. They are accused of being active humanists.
Now we are reaching the Zenith of the Struggle for Peace in Asia, in the World.
If you have not yet signed the petition in support of the villagers please do so by clicking here
An interesting bit of coverage below thanks to Twittering friends.....

HEADING TO DC FOR TRIAL
This weekend I will head to Washington DC to participate in a trial for the non-violent civil disobedience I took part in last March in front of the White House. It was the second time I was arrested for protesting Obama's wars in the last year...the first time all charges were dropped.
VETERANS FOR PEACE
For Immediate Release: July 7, 2011
Contact: Ann Wilcox, (202) 441-3265, wilcox_ann@yahoo.com,
Elliott Adams, President, Veterans for Peace, (518) 284-2048, elliottadams@juno.com
Veterans, Peace Activists to Challenge Arrests in Pro Se Trial on July 11th
Washington, DC:
On Monday, July 11, 2011, 19 veterans, members of the Catholic Worker community, and other long-time peace activists will have a pro se trial in DC Superior Court, stemming from arrests on the White House sidewalk on March 19, 2011. The March 19th action raised issues of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the cost of the wars to American society, and the continued detention of whistleblower Bradley Manning. One hundred thirteen persons were arrested on the White House sidewalk by US Park Police, and 19 of those will proceed to a trial on charges of Failure to Obey a Lawful Order and Unlawful Assembly-Disorderly Conduct.
At 8:00 a.m. on Monday, July 11, 2011, the veterans and peace activists will be available to speak with the media. They will then proceed to a trial, which will be held in Courtroom 313 of DC Superior Court.
The activists have traveled from as far away as Maine, North Carolina, and throughout the Eastern US. Veterans range from World War II veterans, to the Vietnam era and beyond. The trial will highlight the defendants' desire to petition their government for redress of grievances in prosecuting two costly wars; their First Amendment Right in doing so; and other legal arguments. Although there are some first-time activists, many of those going to trial have opposed war for most of their lives. They have continued to "speak truth to power" as they did on March 19th at the White House.
Elliott Adams, President of Veterans for Peace, stated: "I am proud to stand with other veterans of America's military, along with committed peace activists, to oppose the illegal and unnecessary wars that are currently being fought, and to highlight the cost to our society. We, who have experienced war, can help to highlight the costs of war, and the importance of ending these wars now!"
Elliott and other defendants will be available to speak with the media at 8:00 a.m. on Monday, July 11th, at DC Superior Court (500 Indiana Ave., NW).

LATEST THIS ISSUE GUEST
In my latest public access TV show I interview Global Network board member Regina Hagen from Darmstadt, Germany.
Regina has been one of our outstanding leaders for many years - both on the issue of preventing the launch of NASA nuclear power missions into space and on the militarization of space.
Regina holds the distinction of hosting the most Global Network annual space organizing conferences in her country - three times.

OBAMA CAVING IN ON SOCIAL SECURITY
It appears that Obama is quickly betraying the working class on the holy grail of Social Security. To claim that cuts in Social Security will help solve the debt crisis is a complete fabrication. But who could be surprised?
Obama was put in office by the oligarchy for a reason. His job was to finish off social progress and expand militarism. He is doing what he was told to do. He is a man of no inner core and, quite obviously, no conscience.
But somehow there still is a group of people out there who defend him. The oligarchy likes that some defend Obama as he cuts their throats. They laugh all the way to the bank.

LAND OF (USED TO BE) LIBERTY
posted by Bruce K. Gagnon | 3:08 PM | 0 Comments
THE PEOPLE WANT TO STOP MILITARISM
Can you imagine 57 of these monstrosities being plunked down in Gangjeong village to build the Navy base on Jeju Island? This caisson is being built in a nearby village. People there have begun to protest as well.
Professor Yang receives an Indie movie award as "this year's face"
As you can see in the photo above Professor Yang is looking good as he recovers from his 70-some day long hunger strike. I've recently heard that some Gangjeong villagers, who had sold out to the Navy, have asked if they could return to the village. A discussion was taken and they have been accepted back. This likely means a couple things: first, that maybe life away from the village was not so green after all and secondly, maybe they are seeing a growing movement against the Navy base and their hopes for success are building. It is obvious that something is happening in the village as many new people are coming there and staying to help with the fight. The beauty of the place and the determined non-violent struggle is touching the hearts of many. You can keep up with all this on the Facebook page that is a great resource.
There is now a petition on-line to support the Jeju Island campaign. These signatures will be presented to South Korean President Lee at the end of July when an international delegation holds a news conference at the Blue House in Seoul before heading to Jeju Island. You can sign the petition here
Yesterday I spent the day working on getting things ready for a national and international mailing to promote our annual Keep Space for Peace Week. I wrote a cover letter, talked several times with an artist who is doing our poster, and then worked with our design person who is doing the flyer and is our contact with the printer. Lots of loose ends to tie up to get it all together. The poster this year is going to be very different from those we've made in the past.
As I write this Congress is close to making final decisions on the Pentagon budget for 2012. It appears that $648.7 billion will be passed for the military budget, including $118 billion to continue the wars. The Washington Post reports, "Obama is proposing significant reductions in Medicare spending and for the first time is offering to tackle the rising cost of Social Security, according to people in both parties with knowledge of the proposal. The move marks a major shift for the White House and could present a direct challenge to Democratic lawmakers who have vowed to protect health and retirement benefits from the assault on government spending." No surprise here, more of the same accommodation and sell-out by Obama. Polls have shown over and over again that the public massively opposes cuts in Medicare and Social Security but do support tax increases on the rich and cutting war spending. Obama is proving to be the best president the Republicans could ever have because he not only gives the corporate oligarchy everything they want but he also keeps the "left" neutralized. The best the Democrats seem able to do is pass a non-binding "resolution" that says the rich should pay their fair share. More showmanship as they join their president in cutting the throats of the poor and working class.

VETERANS SING AGAINST WAR
Great new video just created by Boston-area Veterans for Peace members and their supporters.
When was the last time you heard a peace song on the radio? It is virtually impossible to get these types of songs on the air. People like Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs etc. would never be heard today. The vast majority of radio stations today are owned by corporate media giants like Clear Channel and these wonderful artist would never make it onto today’s play lists.
The song: War is Not the Answer, Never Was, Never Will was literally written on the 30th anniversary of John Lennon’s death. The word “imagine” is in the song. The song is totally financed by Veterans For Peace chapters, individuals, national and local peace groups. We have forty-five people singing on the chorus, we had a fabulous time recording it. We think it is pretty good- you be the judge – please watch and listen.
Lets put some music back into the peace movement. Please pass this music video on to all of your family, friends and contacts. Ask them to pass it on to their friends and contacts, so on and so on. The lyrics and cords are listed at the end of the video, please copy and share the song with friends. It is up to each of us to help make this happen by passing this music video on to everyone you know and ask them to pass it on.
Thank you,
Pat Scanlon and all the folks that made this music video possible.

OBAMA'S DRONES DELIVERING TOXIC CHEMICALS TO PAKISTAN
The Global Network's annual Keep Space for Peace Week (October 1-8) will this year feature the growing use of drones in waging war. The UK and U.S. anti-drone networks will co-sponsor the week of local actions.
This video, for the first time that I am aware, introduces the issue of toxic chemicals being distributed during U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan. It is becoming obvious that Obama's relentless attacks on civilian populations is intended to serve as a tool to clear territory by wiping out whole communities.
Some would call it genocide.
If George W. Bush was doing this the liberal activists would be screaming their heads off and calling for impeachment. When Obama does this the liberals are largely silent. Party trumps truth and conscience. Very sad indeed.
There is no way on god's green earth that I could ever consider voting for Obama - or any other sniveling Democrat - under these circumstances. They have become the party of toxic prevarication.

JULY 4 PARADE IN BATH
We had 30 of us peace-niks in the Bath, Maine July 4 parade. The enormous peace dove was up near the front of our group and the Earth Mother puppet, carried by me, was near the back. In between we had banners and signs and some dressed as vegetables.
The white peace dove, our first time using it, was a beautiful thing to behold but was an engineering nightmare to put together. It took 1 1/2 hours and thank god for Mark Roman who bailed us out with his patience and skill in helping to make sense of the whole thing.
The response from the crowd was generally polite, some enthusiastic, but many just numb with no reaction. That is to be expected at such a "patriotic" feel good parade. Behind us were the local emergency vehicles - ambulances and fire trucks with their constant sirens blaring. A real drag. I can't see how anyone thinks that noise is fun.
Most of the more than 120 entries in the parade were dull and lacking in imagination. I've written in past years about how local business people use the parade to promote their products and services. What does pest control have to do with liberty?
Of course the idea of liberty (real freedom to think, assemble, speak out, free media) has been trampled and replaced with "support the troops" messaging by the military industrial complex. This blind patriotism has done much to destroy our country. It was heart warming though to occasionally see some in the crowd who really appreciated our group and who applauded us with vigor. We heard of only one person who turned his back on us as we passed by.

INDEPENDENCE FROM AMERICA
The top secret US military base, Menwith Hill, is a little piece of America in the heart of the UK’s Yorkshire Dales. For years it has been a protest hotspot for Britons who are demanding their country’s independence from America.

JEJU IS A GLOBAL ISSUE
The governor of Jeju Island is not happy that people are arriving from all over South Korea to protest the Navy base construction
Big rally held yesterday in Jeju City
People are coming from all over the nation to Jeju and many are staying. Father Moon (famous activist Catholic priest with beard) has recently arrived and announced he will die in Jeju and wants his body buried under the cement that will cover the rocks along the coastline
Latest report from Jeju Island: On July 1st, on the second day of the big action day gathering in Jeju City. Members of Minkahyup (a very old democracy action/human rights group in Korea) approached the car of Woo Keun-min the Governor of Jeju and showing a banner saying, "Retract your cancellation of the conservation area" [He cancelled the original status of Gangjeong village as a conservation area, this is the phrase that everyone chants to him all the time].
The governor got out of the car and asked the activist, “Where are you from?” and she said, “I came from Seoul.” Then he suddenly declared, “This is a Jeju issue, Don’t worry about this, Jeju people will handle this problem.” She replied back, “The Jeju Naval Base issue is not only a Jeju issue. This is about Korea’s peace and security. Whoever wants peace in Korea must worry about this issue. If you [the governor] do not solve this problem more actively then you will be criticized by all the people in the nation.”
Woo Keun-min answered, “I will handle it well.”
In fact the governor has handled it poorly. When he ran for office he gave Jeju Islanders the impression that he would bring fairness and peace to the contentious Navy base issue. In fact all he has done is become a tool of the big corporations (like Samsung who is the lead base building contractor) and the South Korean Navy.
As Secretary of War Robert Gates leaves office he gives a justification for the expansion of U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. The Navy base on Jeju is obviously connected to this larger strategy of U.S. control and domination. See it here

THE ARTIST LANDS IN JAIL FOR LOVING THE VILLAGE
Sung-Hee Choi lived in New York City for about 10 years and while there became an active member of the Global Network. In 2008 when the GN met in Omaha, Nebraska for our annual space organizing conference, Sung-Hee insisted that we come to South Korea the following year. So we did. She and our other GN board member from South Korea, Wooksik Cheong, organized one of our largest and best annual meetings ever in Seoul in 2009.
Since that time Sung-Hee has been working hard to make the connection between Jeju Island and the U.S. plan to expand "missile defense" systems in the Asian-Pacific region. About a year ago she moved full-time to Jeju Island to help defend the village as construction began to speed up.
For the protests seen in this video Sung-Hee found herself in jail. She stands trial on July 15. The video reflects the deep admiration the villagers have for her as she has been instrumental in shepherding people from throughout South Korea and around the world to come support the village.

Opinion, State News	| June 30, 2017, 7:26 AM	
Beth Harwell rolls out then apparently hides propaganda campaign on her support of the 2nd Amendment
Beth Harwell has been the Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives for the last 7 years. During that time, Tennessee has had a Republican governor and a Republican super majority in the Legislature. Anything remotely “republican” should have been easily enacted into law years ago.
During that time about 10 other states including Maine and Rhode Island have adopted constitution carry laws.
During that time, other states were removing gun free zones on legal gun owners.
During that time, other states are reducing or eliminating requirements for permits, fees and background checks on law abiding citizens’ rights under the 2nd Amendment protections.
During that time, Tennessee has fallen further and further behind other states when it comes to the major issues regarding the 2nd Amendment protected rights of citizens.
Why?
It has been no secret that Beth Harwell thinks she is the right person for governor in 2018. The question is whether most Tennesseans agree or suffer from the same delusional fantasy.
On June 22, Beth Harwell posted a video on her Facebook page saying “Tennessee Supports the 2nd Amendment”. It has an image of what appears to be a man with a shotgun hunting. We all know that the 2nd Amendment is about deer or duck hunting, right? But it appears from Harwell’s propaganda that is what Speaker Harwell believes.
Notice, also that the Harwell propaganda says “Tennessee Supports” — which is likely true. It does not say that “Beth Harwell Supports the 2nd Amendment” because, well, that would for the most part be misleading if not measurably false given her conduct, or lack thereof, over the last 7 years in the opinions of some.
If Beth Harwell does not truly support the belief that the 2nd Amendment prohibits infringements on the 2nd Amendment — something that most Tennesseans believe – how can she be governor or even the Speaker of the House absent deception?
Further, if you go search her Facebook timeline today, June 29, you probably will not find the 2nd Amendment post on her public page in the date range of June 22, 2017 – it appears to have been hidden. The reason may be the blistering comments that it was receiving from others.
So let’s go back to assertion that Tennessee, or more specifically, it’s Legislature supports the 2nd Amendment. Certainly some, like another gubernatorial candidate, Sen. Mae Beavers, actually do. There are many more but the goal here is not to catalogue those who honor their oaths or those who have violated them to aid the Speaker’s or the Governor’s agendas.
Under Beth Harwell’s leadership – a leadership which helped meaningfully to force a massive gas tax increase on Tennesseans and a leadership which has helped raise the state’s budget by roughly $10 billion dollars in 7 years – what has the Legislature done – or not done – relative to the 2nd Amendment?
The answer is that there is no credible reason to believe that Beth Harwell’s oligarchical leadership has done anything to meaningfully improve the 2nd Amendment issue in TN in the last 7 years.
She has put chairman after chairman in positions to kill 2nd Amendment legislation – repeatedly.
She has done NOTHING to help get bills like constitutional carry, permitless open carry, elimination of TICS fees, campus carry, elimination of gun free zones, improving the firearm freedom act, removing state oversight of 501(c)(4)’s freedom of speech, removing our 2nd Amendment rights from being treated as “defenses” to criminal charges, restricting the abuses by the Department of Safety, restoring rights of non-violent criminals once their full sentences have been served and once a court of law has “fully restored” their civil rights, and enforcing the 10th Amendment against federal abuses of constitutional rights even to the floor of the House for a debate – much less passage.
Again, she has clearly helped to massively expand the state budget and to pass the largest tax increase in recent history on Tennessee families but she can’t even lift a finger to force constitutional carry or these other 2nd Amendment issues just to the floor for a fair vote and a debate?
Why is she intent on disenfranchising most Tennesseans by keeping these issues from open discussions and debates involving all elected legislators? Why does she prefer to have a small set of trusted operatives do her dirty work?
If she is claiming that things have improved on her watch, that would only be true if George Soros and/or Mayor Bloomberg were setting the agenda …. oh wait, her master, Bill Haslam was part of Bloomberg’s mayor’s against guns agenda wasn’t he…
Truth Matters. If she intended with this Facebook post or similar “pro 2nd Amendment” pronouncements to even remotely suggest that she personally has worked diligently for the 2nd Amendment, then her veracity is a campaign issue. If she has a problem being honest with Tennessee families, then can she even have the gall to beg for the votes of these Tennesseans.
If this turn of events concerns you, join TFA today to help continue the fight!!! If you are already a TFA member and this angers you, as it should, consider making a supplemental member contribution to help continue the legal battle.

What we stand For
There is one constant pledge that we live by and it is that our American Government is founded on the concept of the individuality and the dignity of the human being. Underlying this concept is the belief that the human person is important because he was created by God and endowed by Him with certain unalienable rights which no civil authority may usurp. The inclusion of God in our pledge or our money or in our courts and buildings further acknowledge the dependence of our people and our Government upon the moral directions of the Creator, our Father, the Lord God Almighty.

Experiencing Pain	
Wild And Unprecedented Price Fluctuations Are Causing Financial Chaos For U.S. Businesses
In every war there is a high price to pay, and this trade war will not be any different. The normal flow of goods and services around the globe is being severely disrupted, and even though this trade war has barely just begun, it is already having an enormous impact on the U.S. economy. Even if we ultimately win this trade war and the Trump administration is able to achieve all of the goals that it is targeting, there will still be a great cost in the short-term. We are going to see businesses fail, we are going to see workers get laid off, and global economic activity will inevitably contract. Heck, at this point even Fox News is calling this trade war “economic suicide”. We live at a time when a delicately balanced formula of economic factors allows us to live a debt-fueled standard of living that is far beyond what we actually deserve. Now we are messing with that formula, and the consequences are likely to be far more severe than most Americans are anticipating.
The Trade War Is Already Having A Huge Impact On The U.S. Economy
The trade war has barely just begun, and yet significant ripple effects are already being felt all across the U.S. economy. Once thriving businesses are on the verge of failure, workers are being laid off, and some sectors of the economy are witnessing enormous price hikes. Right now the mainstream media is absolutely fixated on the drama surrounding the recently concluded Trump-Putin summit meeting, but the consequences of this trade war will ultimately be far more important for the lives of most ordinary Americans. As more tariffs continue to be implemented, this will perhaps be the biggest disruption to the global economic system that we have seen in decades. Perhaps you have not been affected personally yet, but for many Americans this trade war has changed everything. For example, just consider the plight of soybean farmer Tim Bardole…
An Absolutely Epic Escalation Of The Trade War Has Us On The Precipice Of A Cataclysmic Global Economic Crisis
If Americans really understood how much their standard of living was about to change, the streets of our major cities would be packed with protesters by tomorrow morning. For the past several decades, China and other low cost exporters have been flooding our shores with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of cheap goods. This is the only reason why you can go to Wal-Mart and buy a shirt for three bucks. But since we buy far more stuff from the rest of the world than they buy from us, we ultimately have to go back to those other nations and beg them to lend our money back to us so that we can pay our bills. This sick, twisted co-dependent relationship has enabled Americans to live a debt-fueled standard of living that is far beyond what we deserve, and now our rapidly escalating trade war with China is going to bring the party to a crashing halt. On Tuesday, the Trump administration released a list of $200,000,000,000 worth of Chinese exports that will be hit with 10 percent tariffs. Those tariffs are in addition to the 25 percent tariffs that had previously been announced on 50 billion dollars worth of Chinese exports. These new tariffs are scheduled to go into effect on August 30th, and the Chinese have already pledged to retaliate.
Experts Warn Of Chaos For The U.S. Economy As China Declares That “The Biggest Trade War In Economic History” Has Begun
Nothing is going to be the same after this. On Friday, the United States hit China with 34 billion dollars in tariffs, and China immediately responded with similar tariffs. If it stopped there, this trade war between the United States and China would not be catastrophic for the global economy. But it isn’t going to stop there. Donald Trump is already talking about hitting China with an additional 500 billion dollars in tariffs, which would essentially cover pretty much everything that China exports to the U.S. in a typical year. The Chinese have accused Trump of starting “the biggest trade war in economic history”, and they are pledging to fight for as long as it takes. As I discussed yesterday, the only way that one side is going to “win” this trade war is if the other side completely backs down, and that simply is not going to happen. So there is going to be economic pain, and that pain is likely to intensify for as long as this trade war persists. U.S. businesses that will be affected by foreign tariffs are already cutting back production and laying off workers, and CNN is reporting that 1,300 products have suddenly become more expensive for U.S. consumers. There will be nowhere that anyone can hide from this trade war, and it will ultimately affect every single man, woman and child in the entire country.
The U.S. Trade War With China Officially Goes To The Next Level As Financial Markets Around The World Continue To Implode
Up until now, the U.S. trade war with China has simply been a bunch of threats and counter-threats, but now things are about to get very real. On Friday, the first round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods becomes official, and these tariffs are going to fundamentally alter the economic relationship between the two largest economies on the entire planet. Over the past several decades, U.S. consumers have loved gobbling up super-cheap goods from China, and the Chinese have used many of the dollars that they have been accumulating to fund our exploding national debt. This symbiotic relationship has been bad for the United States in a lot of ways, and something had to be done, but in the short-term this trade war is going to be enormously painful. Sadly, most Americans are completely oblivious to what is happening. The following comes from Bloomberg…
Things Just Went Nuclear In Our Trade War With China, And A Giant Shockwave Is About To Hit The U.S. Economy
It is difficult to find the words to describe just how serious America’s trade war with China is becoming. As you will see below, the two largest economies on the entire planet are on a self-destructive course that almost seems irreversible at this point. The only way that this trade war is going to come to a rapid conclusion is if one side is willing to totally submit and accept an extremely bitter and humiliating defeat on the global stage, and that is not likely to happen. So in the short-term, and probably beyond that, we are going to experience a tremendous amount of economic pain. In fact, if one wanted to create a recipe for economic disaster, it would be hard to beat having the Federal Reserve dramatically raise interest rates at the exact same time that the U.S. government is starting trade wars with all of the other major economic powers simultaneously. Unless something drastically changes in the very near future, there is no way that the U.S. is going to be able to get through this without experiencing severe pain.

Democrats worry over AG nominee's view of presidential power

WASHINGTON (AP) — William Barr once advised that a president didn't need Congress' permission to attack Iraq, that his administration could arrest a foreign dictator and that the FBI could capture suspects abroad without that country's consent.
It's an expansive view of presidential power and an unsettling one for Democrats as the Senate holds a confirmation hearing next week for Barr, a onetime attorney general and President Donald Trump's pick to again serve as America's top law enforcement official.
Democrats already fear that Barr, if confirmed, would be overly deferential to Trump in a position where legal decisions aren't supposed to be guided by political considerations. Trump has made clear he demands loyalty from an attorney general, repeatedly haranguing and ultimately forcing out his first one, Jeff Sessions, for not protecting the president from the Russia investigation.
Barr's philosophy on presidential power adds to those concerns. As attorney general and in the years since, Barr has expressed his belief that presidents have broad authority, limiting the power of Congress and courts to hold them in check.
Those views were evident in an unsolicited memo Barr sent the Justice Department last year arguing Trump couldn't have obstructed justice by firing ex-FBI Director James Comey. Barr contended presidents cannot be investigated for actions they're lawfully permitted to take, arguments similar to those of Trump's lawyers. That document raised Democratic alarms that Barr could influence special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation in ways that protect Trump. Mueller is investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and contacts with the Trump campaign.
"This view that anything the president does pursuant to his constitutional authority can never be a crime, I think, is very troubling, very alarming and very disconcerting," said Notre Dame law professor Jimmy Gurule, a former Justice Department colleague.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller and remains his most visible Justice Department protector, is expected to leave his position soon after Barr is confirmed, a person familiar with the plans said Wednesday.
If confirmed, Barr would be positioned to oversee the Mueller investigation as pivotal decisions await that could test the scope of presidential authorities and land in court.
Those include whether Trump can be subpoenaed if he won't answer additional questions, and whether to disclose to Congress whatever report Mueller produces. Barr hasn't publicly discussed those questions, but his memo did criticize Mueller's theory of obstruction as "fatally misconceived."
"Bill is a learned man and is a capable lawyer, and he knows how to make the arguments in the trenches for the construction of a statute in favor of the president's authority," said Pepperdine University law professor Douglas Kmiec, who preceded Barr as head of the Justice Department's legal counsel office. Barr, he said, exhibited a demeanor of, "'The president must be right, let's find a way to make it so.'"
Barr has rejected any suggestion of being a rubber stamp for presidential powers, citing instances in which he concluded that the White House lacked authorities for a line-item veto or to index the capital gains text to inflation. He noted in one 1992 speech the president's responsibility to "advance responsible positions of law," saying the government will lose ground through unreasonable stances.
"Our view has been that if we go into court with untenable positions and lose, we ultimately weaken the office of the President," he said.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.
Barr's friends and associates say it's not his nature to be a pushover for a president and defend his viewpoints as carefully reasoned, respectful of the Justice Department and White House and consistent with conservative legal philosophy.
They note that the legal counsel office he once led is tasked with advising executive branch agencies and under various administrations has issued opinions favorable to the president, including that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The office, said Timothy Flanigan, who held the job after Barr, operates with the premise that the "president starts with a lot of powers, significant powers, based on the Constitution."
"Bill's not some type of extremist or outlier," said Chuck Cooper, a friend who also led the office. "He falls well within mainstream executive branch learning, if you will, about the powers of the presidency and its relationship to the other branches."
It was in the legal counsel job that Barr provided some of his most meaningful guidance: opinions that empowered FBI agents to seize fugitives overseas and that justified the invasion of Panama and arrest of dictator Manuel Noriega. The night President George H.W. Bush gave the invasion order, Barr was playing bagpipes at Attorney General Richard Thornburgh's Christmas party, then scurried to the White House.
As attorney general between 1991 and 1993, Barr blessed Bush's desire to pardon Reagan administration officials in the Iran-Contra scandal as within the president's authority. The Constitution, he observed in one 1992 speech, created a "strong, unitary executive with veto power" and called it "grade school" analysis to suggest the Founding Fathers were primarily concerned with presidential overreach.
"The aim of the framers was not to enfeeble the executive branch, but quite the contrary, to recreate a strong executive, with sufficient constitutional powers of its own, to check abuse and encroachment by the legislature," he said.
He was deputy attorney general when, with Thornburgh out of town, he was summoned to a White House meeting and asked if Bush had authority to attack Iraq without congressional approval.
"I said, 'Mr. President, there's no doubt that you have the authority to launch an attack,'" Barr recalled in a 2001 oral history.
But, he added, a congressional resolution was wise nonetheless. Congress ultimately authorized it.
When then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Barr was giving political rather than legal advice, Barr interjected: "I said, No, I'm giving him both political and legal advice. They're really sort of together when you get to this level."
After leaving government, he supported President George W. Bush's authority to designate as enemy combatants militants captured overseas and prosecute them in military tribunals.

Fear is one of the most significant barriers to people and success. Tang is systematic in developing logical and real world examples on how to overcome the fear that undermines one’s goals.

WellingtonFL.gov has been undergoing a makeover for several months, and village officials plan to launch the re-designed website sometime this month.
They offered a tease this week on YouTube:
The village’s current website can be hard to navigate at times, so most residents will likely welcome a more user-friendly site.

I would assume that, as the country’s preeminent civil rights organization, the NRA is interested in supporting people’s ability to engage in free speech as well as defend themselves against their fellow citizens or their government. Why she should be on your board: Leah has run a strong consumer focused marketplace and has collaborative consumption product expertise, with the tech understanding behind it. I think what the man means is: Apple, Microsoft, Google and other big tech” companies should not decide which words or emojis represent their brand. With the industry projected to generate more than $1.9 billion in revenue by 2018 , there are various rising tech players to watch as this fierce competition heats up. Samsung is reportedly selling off shares it holds in other tech companies to help pay for the massive recall involving its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. For those who are thinking of brushing off their resumes to try something new in 2016, job-hunting site Glassdoor has the inside skinny on which tech companies are making their employees happiest.
The pay for these jobs is good according to Cybercities 2008: An Overview of the High-Technology Industry in the Nation’s Top 60 Cities, with high-tech employees earning an average of $70,100 annually – that’s 91 percent more than the average private sector wage in Boise, ID. Explore the links below to learn more about the companies offering these opportunities and find these lucrative high tech jobs in Boise.
According to the recent TIA: EAST Tech in Africa report, the growth of mobile penetration particularly in East Africa has been expanding with similar pace as that of the US and Europe; with development of internet and e-commerce progressing at a faster rate.
Though the U.S. lags behind many developed countries for its nationally mandated family paid leave, the top tech companies have different and interesting programs that may help inform the problems both Trump and Clinton are trying to solve. I find that many early stage companies shy away from calling their attorney because of cost concerns. Before being acquired by in 2014, OpenTable reported that it had exceeded a 60 percent share in San Francisco.
That former official’s account – that the process was created by Congress six years ago and includes judicial oversight – was independently confirmed by another person with direct knowledge of how this data collection happens at multiple companies. You can’t have Geek Expo 5.0 without an opening speech from a famous tech geek, whose pronouncements on the future of our society are followed like those of a religious prophet. Some companies are moving to 5-year vesting, and others are back-loading the vesting, so that employees get a smaller percentage of shares in their first 2-3 years, and then receive a large lump sum in year 4/5 (up to 50{3d25c03f3d03a098b39b3db087b07f4bc733195bbf66991a92a5a481dc1e5136}). With so little formal capital, many Internet companies have high ROIC figures as soon as they become profitable.

Perceiving the True Nature of Islam: Rape and Supression
In this post I wanna turn back to the article David Wood posted on the rape of a 12 year old Christian girl raped by a gang of Islamic students.
I am inclined to believe that the incident reveals a notorious reality about the true nature of Islam.
Here is the part of the article:
'...these madrassa students got hold of her and took her in the fields. I tried
to stop them, but they were 15-16 in number.” Seven or eight of the boys
reportedly then raped the girl while the others looked on. Before the attack
began, the teacher overheard one of the students say, “We will teach these
Christians a lesson they will never forget.”
The Christian girl, whose
name has been withheld, was left in the field until some villagers eventually
took her home to her family. The girl’s father and the teacher have attempted to
file a complaint but the officer in charge has refused to comply. Another
officer has since admitted that they are under pressure from Muslim leaders and
extremists to refrain from filing a report. The madrassa students had reportedly
been harassing believers in the surrounding villages, beating and threatening
Christian children to convert to Islam or leave the area.'
http://www.answeringmuslims.com/2010/08/pakistani-muslims-continue-gang-raping.html
As I pointed out in the comment section:
It ... concerns me, that these culprints were all islamic students?
If raping Christian 'dhimmis' or non-believers is completely 'haram' in the Islamic religion, as some Muslims would assert (and we know from various Bukhari and Sahih Muslim passages that such is permitted) would not at least some of these youngsters oppose the act of gang-raping a Christian girl?
My question is: what makes a group of Islamic students studying Islam in a Pakistani madrassa, wanna teach the Christians (who are already dhimmis, second class citizens and suppressed) a lesson, and lesson for what?
1. What makes these students and followers of Islam gang-rape a 12 year old Christian girl?
2. What kind of a twisted mindset inspires students of the Qur’an and the Sunnah to instigate terror on suppressed Christians who are not even able to, nor have the right to defend themselves?
3. What inspires Islamic student to roam on the streets and beat and threaten Christian children either to convert to Islam or to escape the area?
What would Muslims make out of it if 10 Christian Bible students harassed local Muslim children (who were already suppressed) and gang-raped a 12 year old Muslim girl. Furthermore, what would Muslims conclude if the Christian institution and the Christian local authority condoned this action?
1. Keep in mind this incident in Pakistan did not take place in the North West Frontier, or in Taliban area but in close proximity to Islamabad the capital of Pakistan.
2. Keep also in mind that the inspiration that occupies the soul, mind and action of these kids can only derive from influence of the Qur’an and the Hadiths.
From where then does such inspiration derive?
It’s a fact that Muhammed’s close followers raped females:
Narrated Buraida: The prophet sent Ali to Khalid to bring the Khumus (part of the war booty) and I hated Ali, and Ali had taken a bath (after a sexual act with a slave girl from the Khumus). I said to Khalid, "Don't you see this (i.e. Ali)? When we reached the prophet I mentioned that to him. He said, "O Buraida! Do you hate Ali?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Do you hate him for he deserves more than that from the Khumus." (Sahih Bukhari, vol.5, #637)
That Muhammad and Muslims in general were permitted to engage in sex with slave girls is clearly stated by the Qur'an:
Prophet, We have made lawful to you the wives whom you have granted dowries and the slave girls whom God has given you as booty;..." (Sura 33: 50)
These slave girls are according to the passage girls capture in war; hence this suggests sex by force or sex forced upon individuals who simply have not choice but to surrender to such attrocities.
The permission to rape females in Islam is further established by these passages (among others):
Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri that during the battle with Bani Al-Mustaliq they (Muslims) captured some females and intended to have sexual relations with them without impregnating them. So they asked the prophet about coitus interruptus. The prophet said, "It is better that you should not do it, for Allah has written whom He is going to create till the Day of Resurrection". (Sahih Bukhari, vol.9, #506) (further reference Bukhari 5: 459)
Abu Sirma said to Abu Said al Khudri: "O Abu Said, did you hear Allah's messenger mentioning about al-azl (coitus interrupts)?" He said, "Yes", and added: "We went out with Allah's messenger on the expedition to the Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing azl" (withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid conception). But we said: "We are doing an act whereas Allah's messenger is amongst us; why not ask him?" So we asked Allah's messenger and he said: "It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born". (Sahih Muslim vol.2, # 3371)
Abu Said al-Khudri said: "The apostle of Allah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of the apostle of Allah were reluctant to have intercourse with the female captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers. So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Quranic verse, "And all married women (are forbidden) unto your save those (captives) whom your right hand possesses". That is to say, they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period."" [The Quran verse is 4:24]. (Sunan of Abu Dawud, vol.2, #2150)
It’s also a fact that dhimmis are to be subjugated and suppressed (according to Islam):
Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth among the people of the Scripture, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued (Sura 9: 29).
My question is this: is rape and subjugation entirely foreign to the religion of Islam, or does it reveal an element within the nature of the Islamic mindset?
Can we truly blame a gang of Islamic students for suppressing the suppressed and raping a 12 year old girl from another religion, when the earliest Muslims and their holy writings themselves condone and instigate such actions?

I think the source of these horrific actions against innocent defenseless people is the source of Islam itself: Satan.
I wonder, am I the only one who has noticed that place where the "angel" took Mohammed on his night journey, i.e. the Temple mount is the same place that Lucifer took Jesus in his temptation? The same M.O. seems way too perfect to be a coincidence....

In regards to 33:50 in the Quran, isn't the privilege to have sex with "those whom thy right hand has come to possess from among the captives of war" only for Muhammad, and not for all Muslims? Later in the verse, it says, "...A privilege for thee, and not for other believers..."
August 21, 2010 at 10:55 PM
David Wood said...
The "privilege for thee" part refers to the fact that Muhammad could marry more than four women.
Other verses of the Qur'an clearly give Muslims the right to have sex with their captives (even married captives).
Qur'an 4:24--"And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty (hath been done). Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Wise."

ughh....you know I don't get it.... I really don't. Why oh why would you follow a religion that is not just problematic in its authenticity, but brutal in it's theology. As a human being this does not make any sense.

It is so, so sad that this kind of thing happens. My heart goes out to this poor girl. She has experienced such horrific persecution, and at such a terribly young age. Satan is most assuredly behind attacks like this. We are praying for peace and deliverance from evil, for these victims.
Praise God, His kingdom will continue to move forward, no matter how the enemy tries to thwart it!

Mr. Wood,
After reading the verse of the Qur'an your quoted here it seems to me that it is CAPTIVES that are the ones that the men were allowed to have sex with not random Christian girls so I am not seeing the correlation of Islam allowing these boys to commit this horrid act. Also in the Old testament of the Bible the men also took captives and just to make it look a little better forced the women to be there wives
and in numbers after one attack on the Midianites they destroyed everyone except the virgins and gave them to the soldiers there being not enough virgins for all the soldiers they allowed those without a virgin to go and hide in a vineyard and when women came out to participate in a celebration they kidnapped them. Therefore, saying that rape and violence is only a thing of Islam is contrary to fact

Istilah,
I am almost shell-shocked by your silly argument...
"it seems to me that it is CAPTIVES that are the ones that the men were allowed to have sex with not random Christian girls"
You do know the meaning of being 'captives', right? You know? Captured? Held against their will?
This news is NOT about some bunch of Muslim boys having sex with one Christian girl... this is news about some bunch of Muslim boys GANG-RAPING ONE Christian girl!
To rape means to force sex upon someone against their will... and we see clearly from the article, the girl was CAPTURED against her will (hence she is now a captive) and then raped.
Very silly argument you're making...
And regarding the Numbers reference you made, I'm not sure which chapter or verse is that found, but I am VERY certain if you read further.. the passage itself would explain itself and will prove that it is NOT the same as rape or violence as you so willingly want to equate it as.

Istilah: Yes terrible things happened in the Bible, such as men stealing women to be their wives. Much worse things happened then that, but there is a difference. The Bible describes these things as they took place, what those men chose to do, but no where will you see the God of the Bible condoning such actions. Where as in the Quran, Allah, through Mohammad is condoning and even commanding such practices.

Zach,
Ok, so you think its a silly argument that is fine, but please try to keep your comments from acting like I am stupid and can not understand simple words. All I was trying to state is that Islam can't be blamed for the violent acts that people who claim to follow Islam commit. I am not a muslim nor a christian I claim no religion so I am not trying to prove either right or wrong. I am simply stating what I think.
David,
Can I ask which verses you are refering to when you state that the Qur'an promotes such acts...God does command cities to be destroyed. I am certainly aware of the worse happenings

Islam does, in fact, condone violence:

"Zach,

I apologize if my sarcasm was received badly, it was not intended to insult your intellect.. but merely to stress the understanding that you seem to overlook, when it comes to the term 'captive' and 'captured -> gangrape'.
"All I was trying to state is that Islam can't be blamed for the violent acts that people who claim to follow Islam commit."
And thus, with the same logic, you can't blame people in the bible for doing some despicable acts that were not commanded by God. (although I still don know what was the context of that situation you mentioned just now, in numbers)
However, unlike Islam, the Quran DOES have Allah condoning such things through his prophet Muhammad; e.g. having more than 4 wives, jihad for salvation, having sex with captured slaves, violence, etc.
I'm sure others here have more information than I do regarding that. (example: Sura 9:29 is a popularly quoted one)
"God does command cities to be destroyed. I am certainly aware of the worse happenings"
I'm not sure what you meant by that last phrase, so I'll ignore that for now.
God does command cities to be destroyed, yes.. but why did He do it, that is the real question.
If you read the bible more (usually before the command to destroy), you'd come to realize that God had actually gave those people a long 'grace' period (most for hundreds of years; most likely to repent and turn away from continuing to sin) before finally sending someone to destroy them all.
Christians believe that God is the ultimate judge, and thus, just as a human judge can declare death sentence to a guilty man, so does God have the right to declare death sentence on us.
But being the loving and merciful God He is, He wants us to know that He loves us and wants us to saved from our sins and allows us *plenty of* time to seek Him and repent of our sins. What's more, He will definitely do what He can to get you to realize that (e.g. sending 'messagers', visions, thoughts, sequence of events, etc).
I hope you'll be open minded, istilah, and consider God and His message of love to you. =)

Rose,
I've been watching a few debates on the issue of violence in Islam...I'm siding with the muslims on this one. I would have to go back and watch them again if I were to quote any of the debates, but at the end of the debates I watched I sided with Islam
August 24, 2010 at 8:57 PM
Istilah said...
Zach,
Its all good :)I really am hard to offend, but since I don't know you I didnt know if you are a sarcastic person or not. Sorry for my assumption.
Sura 9:29 is something that I thought showed the violence in Islam as well until I looked at the history behind it. At this point in time non-muslims were asked to pay a tax so that they could have all the rights as a muslim. The muslims also had to pay a tax but theres was much higher than the non-muslims. The law gave them several options of either paying the tax, leaving the area, or fighting the tax and when they are using the word Subdued in the verse they are talking about the non-muslims excepting to live under Islamic law since they are living in an Islamic state.
"If you read the bible more (usually before the command to destroy), you'd come to realize that God had actually gave those people a long 'grace' period (most for hundreds of years; most likely to repent and turn away from continuing to sin) before finally sending someone to destroy them all."
Like he did for the Egyptians...
I thought Jesus was the Ultimate judge. Thats one thing I dont like about Christian teaching Jesus coming as a man and dying for humanities sins and then he is the one judging us...He was a man he can't be God
I'll stay open-minded as long as possible :)until I decide whats true

Istilah:
Are you really "open-minded?" Let's see.
The J.W's say Jesus is not God. In their N.W.T we see some interesting things;
Heb. 1:
1 God, who long ago spoke on many occasions and in many ways to our forefathers by means of the prophets, 2 has at the end of these days spoken to us by means of a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the systems of things.
Note what it says Jesus did here; He created all things!
3 He is the reflection of [his] glory and the exact representation of his very being, and he sustains all things by the word of his power; and after he had made a purification for our sins he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty in lofty places.
You gotta hear how they try to wriggle outta this one.
4 So he has become better than the angels, to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.
They say He was "an angel." So, here they have an "angel" becoming better than other angels!
5 For example, to which one of the angels did he ever say: “You are my son; I, today, I have become your father”? And again: “I myself shall become his father, and he himself will become my son”?
6 But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: “And let all God’s angels do obeisance to him.”
There's a little trick they play with the word "obeisance;" see you can't have angels being worshiped by anyone, so they change the meaning of it.
John 8: 24 Therefore I said to YOU, YOU will die in YOUR sins. For if YOU do not believe that I am [he], YOU will die in YOUR sins.”
So, is Jesus saying, 'unless you believe I am a created being, you will die in your sins?' What do you think?
August 25, 2010 at 11:17 AM

P.s:
Read S.9 from verse 1, it helps with the context.
August 25, 2010 at 11:21 AM
Istilah said...
hugh,
Ok so the J.W's believe that christ is inferior to God, but I do have issues with a good many of there other teachings for example, They claim that only 144,000 followers are going to heaven. I am pretty sure that there are more than 144,000 J.W's in this world. What happened to saving all humanity. Also J.W's say that all prayers MUST go through Christ they cannot pray to god directly.
August 25, 2010 at 12:19 PM
Zack_Tiang said...
Istilah,
I have learnt a fair lot regarding JW and their teaching... but I won't talk about what they believe regarding Christ...
Are you a JW, first of all?
Anyway...
"I thought Jesus was the Ultimate judge. Thats one thing I dont like about Christian teaching Jesus coming as a man and dying for humanities sins and then he is the one judging us...He was a man he can't be God"
May I know further your understanding of Christ?
Yes, He is the Judge. It is stated in the bible (somewhere, I can't remember the verse, but can look it up online) that God has given His Son, Christ the authority to judge all creation at the end of days.
Now, how does Jesus being a man or dying for humanity make Him:
1 - not God and
2 - just a man?
Hope you can explain your position more, before I respond or explain my position.
May the Lord who is true, who is the Amen lead us all to the truth of who Jesus Christ is. =)

"He was a man he can't be God."
Do you agree the J.W, N.W.T says Jesus is God?
J.W's are not out to save all humanity. When they go door2door it's not with a passion to save souls from Armageddon, they're out to save their own necks! They're witnessing to earn their own
salvation.
You have a unique 2 class religion here. 144,000 miss Armageddon, the
rest have to rough-it on earth. However, the refs' say otherwise.
Rev.7:9 After these things I saw, and, look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes; and there were palm branches in their hands.
13 And in response one of the elders said to me: “These who are dressed in the white robes, who are they and where did they come from?” 14 So right away I said to him: “My lord, you are the one that knows.” And he said to me: “These are the ones that come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 15 That is why they are before the throne of God; and they are rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple; and the One seated on the throne will spread his tent over them.
The 'Great Crowd' are not the 144,000!

Zach,
No I am not a J.W, I grew up going to a Pentecostal(ag) church. However, most of my friends are J.W's
I take most of the muslim views of Jesus.
Jesus cannot be God because first off he died, a God cannot die. GOD is forever having no end, and God would not let his own creation kill him because he created man to worship him. Who would worship a God that they just killed. I wouldn't. Also a man can't die for another mans sin because he is just a man not a god only god can forgive our sins
I hope I explained my thoughts clearly enough let me know If they are to jumbled.

"Do you agree the J.W, N.W.T says Jesus is God?"
Did you mean, do you agree the J.W, N.W.T says jesus is not God?
If that was your question then not really, I don't believe Jesus is God, yes. However, I do not believe that because there N.W.T says it.
"J.W's are not out to save all humanity. When they go door2door it's not with a passion to save souls from Armageddon, they're out to save their own necks! They're witnessing to earn their own

Are you a J.W??
the arguments made with the bible are fine, but since I don't always believe in what it says they don't change my views very often.

Istilah:
My Q was; "Do you agree the J.W, N.W.T says Jesus is God?"
Once you start putting reason above revelation you're bound to run into trouble. I'm not a J.W, I've been studying them though and find many faults in their teachings, same as Islam.
"the arguments made with the bible are fine, but since I don't always believe in what it says they don't change my views very often."
If you're reasoning is what really matters we can make up anything, right? And on what basis do you listen to Muslim beliefs about Jesus? How do you decide which biblical or Koran texts to accept or reject? Islam has a made up Jesus, so do the J.W's.
When Jesus said: John 8:24 Therefore I said to YOU, YOU will die in YOUR sins. For if YOU do not believe that I am [he], YOU will die in YOUR sins.” N.W.T, He was not saying believe I am a created being. Heb.1 is one of many examples to prove Christ's deity, even in the N.W.T.

Istilah,
Glad to know you're not a JW. Hope your friends will learn the truth about Christ and about their Watchtower organization and come to repentance to the true Christ and be in a right relationship with Him.
Ok.. thank you for explaining yourself.
Now here are some thoughts for you.
1 - Is God spirit? Meaning He doesn't have a physical nature of any kind?
2 - Do you believe that every human body compose of a soul/spirit and a physical body?
3 - Biblical Christians believe Jesus is both fully man and fully God. Just like how we have a body of man and a spirit of man, does it not make sense (especially if you answered 'yes' to both questions earlier) that Jesus had a body of a man but instead of a spirit of a man, the spirit of God Himself?
4 - Assuming you understand the previous question, then you should be able to understand how Jesus, being God in man's form, died in his physical form, but never in His spiritual nature (since even us humans' spirits are immortal).
5 - Thus, we conclude that God never died in Jesus and men never killed God.... only His physical body which He CHOSE to enter.
Just some thoughts regarding Jesus and His divinity.
That's what Muslims do, they appeal to logical sense and what they say is true (e.g. God can't die, etc), but they never accurately represent the Biblical Christians' true understanding of Jesus's divinity. Once they do, they have no other choice but to accept it.
Now... to the next issue you mentioned, how is a man able to die for another man's sin? let alone the whole of humanity.
Istilah "because he is just a man not a god only god can forgive our sins"
It's rather strange that you say that, because Jesus, more than once in the bible, forgave sins of those who came to Him, and over and over spoke about how no one can see God or Heaven unless they come to/believe in/follow/etc Him.
But anyway, allow me to explain as best as I can, so you may understand what Jesus has done for you.
Imagine you're a thief in court with all the evidence to prove you're guilty.
The judge, being just, must pass sentence upon you; let's say 1,000,000,000,000 dollars or else be imprisoned for life.
Naturally, you can't afford the penalty and thus have to be imprisoned for life.
However....
After passing the sentence, the judge stands from his seat, takes off his robe, steps down to the level you're at, and pays the penalty for you on your behalf.
You, who was found guilty on all charges, are now a free man for your penalty has been fully paid for by someone who was not guilty of any charges.
August 26, 2010 at 7:43 PM
Zack_Tiang said...
That is what Jesus, who is God Himself, has done for you and me, Istilah.
The bible tells us that the penalty for sin is death... and we will all die physically one day, but the bible also tells us that there's a second death; HELL, and our spirits being eternal, we will never get out of it if we died the 2nd death.
But Jesus, being God, chose to put aside His glorious majesty as our Creator and came into His creation, to humbly come down to our level, to become human Himself.
As a human, He went through all the difficulties we go through as a man; He hungered physically, He needed God spiritually (we believe in the Trinity), He was tempted by Satan himself, etc. But He perfectly overcome all of those difficulties; something none of us mere men ever did or will ever be able to do.
Jesus fulfilled many prophecies that were written in the Old Testament, but the ultimate prophecy He fulfilled was that He died on a cross after He was falsely accused and sentenced to death. He suffered excruciatingly prior to and on the cross, and died in His physical form.
Then He descended to Hades/Sheol, but being a man without sin, death/Hades holds no power against Jesus and Jesus ultimately rose from the dead 3 days after His death; proving once and for all that He is the ultimate victor, even over Death.
Thus, because of what He's done, the penalty for OUR sin has been fully paid for.
BUT, you have two choices to make, Istilah..
1 - You can reject what Jesus (who is the Judge at the end of the world) has done for you and His gracious gift of salvation and choose to live your live either ignorant of the penalty or working your way to pay the debt yourself.
(However, remember that God is a perfect and just being and can't tolerate ANY inkling of sin to enter Heaven; a drop of cyanide makes the whole glass of milk poisonous)
OR
2 - You can believe what Jesus has done for you and accept/receive His gracious gift of salvation and choose to be forever in debt to Him.
(Being in debt to Him is not the same as being in debt to a loan shark, who doesn't care for your well-being or love you in any way)
I hope my explanation has been clear and that the Holy Spirit is working in you to let you understand how significant the Good News of Jesus Christ is for your life; both here and in the hereafter!

NFL Teams Pushing The Boundries During Draft Asking Players If They Are "Gay"
Will Kohler May 7, 2010
0 5 Less than a minute
Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins says that during last month’s NFL draft, one pro football team asked him whether he was straight or gay.
“The only unusual question I got was if I was straight or gay,” said Atkins. “
Outsports.com suggests the exchange reflects a broader practice of asking players about their sexual orientation:
“Unfortunately, Atkins didn’t say what his answer was. Either way, you have to assume it’s not just one team asking, or that Atkins was the only one asked.”
News of the sexual orientation interrogation follows other reports about NFL draft questions that push the boundaries of what’s appropriate. Miami Dolphins general manager Jeff Ireland asked wide receiver Dez Bryant whether his mother, who is a lesbian, was ever a prostitute.
So it seems that football still operates with a good ‘ol boy, knuckle dragging neanderthal mentality and still completely homophobic. You know, like back in the 50’s, where they’d say all gay men are fruits, sissies and pedophiles. I’m almost sure they don’t want any of their players coming out or supporting gays. It’s going to take some pro player and a huge monster lawsuit against them to force teams and managers to change their ways, or at least their rhetoric and questions.

Bitch Say What? – Anti-Gay Activist and Biotch Karen England of the Capitol Resource Institute Is Upset That California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado Blew Off Her Hate Groups Request To Appeal to Prop 8
Will Kohler September 14, 2010
0 4 1 minute read
Karen England and her Capitol Resource Institute are an insane homophobic group that appears to taunt gays just ’cause they can issue press releases.
In this Press Release England and her merry band of haters are pissed at California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado, who blew off her group’s demand that he rush out an appeal to Prop 8 while Arnold was out of the country before the Prop 8 Appeal deadline passed.
“The deadline for Lt. Governor, Abel Maldonado to file an appeal to a federal court decision overturning California’s voter approved Proposition 8 passed Monday without the acting governor responding to the pleas for him to assure that the case be heard in the appellate courts. In an eight hour period, Proposition 8 supporters called, and sent messages by FAX, text and social media asking the acting governor to sign the appeal. But Maldonado refused to address the issue.
Maldonado did not even bother to respond. When a representative of Capitol Resource Institute contacted Maldonado’s campaign manager a half hour before the deadline to file, the aide complained that phone calls had tied up the phones all day at the capitol and their campaign office, but he did not know what the Lt. Governor was going to do. He promised to call back, but the call never came.”
Well gee Karen, I wonder why he didn’t call you back? Could it be because you are a crazy evil hateful bitch?
It always amazes me that funniest thing about these non-descript people is being a Christian asshole gives them status and purpose. Look at Maggie Gallagher and then at this “woman.” Who would notice them if they weren’t hating on someone in the name of Jesus?
England is just another in a long line who wake up in the morning, looks in the mirror (and hope it doesn’t shatter…yikes, what a mug) and says ‘Oh good, I get to hate and discriminate today…life is good!’
Hopefully there is a Kansas farmhouse flying around in a tornado somewhere out there that has her name it.

Trump declares national emergency to build border
By ALAN FRAM, CATHERINE LUCEY and ZEKE MILLER ASSOCIATED PRESS

President Donald Trump speaks during an event in the Rose Garden at the White House Friday, Feb. 15, 2019 in Washington.

WASHINGTON (AP) Battling with one branch of government and opening a new confrontation with another, President Donald Trump announced Friday he was declaring a national emergency to fulfill his pledge to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Bypassing Congress, which approved far less money for his proposed wall than he had sought, Trump said he would use executive action to siphon billions of dollars from federal military construction and counterdrug efforts for the wall, aides said. The move is already drawing bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill and expected to face rounds of legal challenges.
Trump made the announcement from the Rose Garden, as he claimed illegal immigration was "an invasion of our country."
Trump's move followed a rare show of bipartisanship when lawmakers voted Thursday to fund large swaths of the government and avoid a repeat of this winter's debilitating five-week government shutdown. The money in the bill for border barriers, about $1.4 billion, is far below the $5.7 billion Trump insisted he needed and would finance just a quarter of the more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) he wanted this year.
To bridge the gap, Trump announced that he will be spending roughly $8 billion on border barriers combining the money approved by Congress with funding he plans to repurpose through executive actions, including the national emergency. The money is expected to come from funds targeted for military construction and counterdrug efforts, but aides could not immediately specify which military projects would be affected.

Posted 25 Oct 2018 / 0

I love when math and science can be brought as Read More

Republicans release climate change plan based on “Respiration Reduction”
Posted 01 Apr 2017 / 0

Could it be possible that the Trump administration had a plan to deal with climate change? And what does climate change have to do with microbes and antibiotics? Environmentalists, political Read More

My ecological footprint for 2016-2017
Posted 31 Oct 2016 / 0
It’s that time of year again. Once again I send my students in my Ecology course out to estimate their ecological footprints, so to show that I am holding myself to a similar standard — and to make sure to keep myself ecologically self-aware — I always make sure to make my own footprint public. This should Read More

Omar’s, Dunchurch, Rugby
I’ve written about curry before, but since you can never have enough curry, I’m going to write a bit more. You’ve heard about my previous Indian outings to Masala Lounge in Rugby, and there are a few others in the town that Mr M and I have been known to frequent. But last week I was introduced to a new one by a friend.
Omar’s is in Dunchurch, a village literally just outside Rugby. It’s home to some rather nice houses, a couple of nice pubs, and a handful of eateries. I’ve written about Nook on the Square before, and I’m sure at some point you’ll get a rave about the Huntsman Carvery (I know, carvery – but it’s actually bloody good!). Anyway, a friend suggested we go to Omar’s. He’d had a takeaway from there and was jolly impressed, so we went to try a sit down meal. And in fact, I enjoyed it so much that I ended up returning just a few days later with Mr M and my mum in tow.
It’s a funny little place, inside an old cottage, so as you walk in you do kind of feel like you’re wandering into someone’s house. The restaurant is far bigger than it looks from the outside, spreading through endless rooms which actually serves to give it quite an intimate atmosphere, a bit like the feeling I got at the Shimla Palace in Wolseley Bridge.
The service was efficient – we were whisked into the back room to a table loaded with ‘Omar’s’ decorated crockery, soon joined by drinks, poppadoms and dips.
I was so busy catching up with my old pal that I didn’t do my usual poring over the menu. Instead, I resorted to asking our waiter what I should have. Always helpful, especially when there are a few dishes you haven’t tried before.
For starter he suggested Rashmi kebab – tandoori chicken breast, with an egg on top. I’m not too good with egg descriptions, but I think we’d call it sunnyside up – you know, when it’s been fried on both sides? It was nice – nothing to write home about, but nice. The chicken was tender, the egg cooked nicely, and the whole thing fairly light and tasty. Andy went for the cryptically-named ‘Assorted’. I’d been half-tempted just because of the name, but it turns out it was literally, an assortment of some of the standard starters you’d expect – sheekh kebab, pakoras etc.
For main course I couldn’t decide yet again, but our waiter suggested the lamb chilli gosth. I’ve got pals who never order lamb in an Indian restaurant amid concerns that it might not actually be the meat it claims to be, but I can vouch for Omar’s. Tender chunks of meat that was clearly lamb, spiced with fresh green chilli. The chappatis I ordered to go with it were thin and light and a great vehicle for scooping up the sauce.
While our starters didn’t blow me away, the main courses trumped some of our regular curry haunts in Rugby. The restaurant was packed which is always a good sign, and Omar himself was a great host, recognising my friend and inviting us to stay for a drink afterwards. Pretty darn impressed, when I found myself nearby with Mr M and my mum a few days later I thought I’d make a return visit to try some other dishes, and get their verdict on Omar’s too.
This time I opted for ‘Sizzling fish’ – Bengal-style spicy fried fish served on a Hades-hot cast iron dish with onions. I completely forgot to ask what kind of fish it was, but it almost had the texture of tuna. Meaty and chunky, and a blimin’ generous portion. So generous that I was going to save half for my lunch the next day until Jamie polished it off. He had gone for a lamb pathia – his dish of choice, spiced up with some extra green chilli. It got the thumbs up from him (not all of them do, trust me).
Instead of rice or bread, I decided (as I often do) to have a vegetable side dish as an accompaniment. Saag is one of my all-time favourites, and despite usually just having a plain saag bhaji, I decided to try the saag paneer. I’ve recently developed a serious love for cheeses like paneer and halloumi – it’s all about the slightly-chewy-but-not-rubbery texture and they seem to carry flavours and spices really well.
It’s got to be said, Omar’s was one of the best saags I’ve ever had. The perfect consistency – smooth but not a complete liquid, delicately flavoured, and without – this is a rarity – that layer of ghee that you get floating on the top of so many. This was going to be the other half of my lunch the next day, but also got polished off!
Mummy B s a sucker for a thali – and since this is on Omar’s menu it was obviously the dish she was gonna choose. If you don’t know what it is, it’s a selection of small portions of several different dishes – curries, sides, rice, bread. I’m not even entirely sure of the entire list at Omar’s but her feast of little treats included two different curries, a veg dish, some fluffy rice, yoghurt rhaita and a chappati.
Despite being stuffed, mum couldn’t resist a dessert of gulab jamun once she spotted it. These Indian sweets aren’t on every menu – at least I don’t see them that often – but they’re one of her favourites, and I remember her making them for me occasionally when I was younger. Basically, they’re usually made of a dough made from milk powder then deep fried (sort of like a kind of donut) then soaked in a syrup flavoured with rosewater and cardamom. I love them because they’re usually more sickly than a five-year-old’s birthday party.
These weren’t quite as sweet as that, which might appeal more to some people. They were served cold rather than warm (apparently this is the norm – just goes to show how variations on a theme can trump the original for some of us) but the syrup was a party of rosewater, sugar and cardamom that provided a nice closer to the meal.
Omar’s winning hosting skills on my previous visit certainly hadn’t been a one-off. He charmed mum and Jamie, as he did the whole restaurant, and I watched him work the room like a consummate professional restaurateur, greeting regulars like old friends, and getting to know newbies like us. A few minutes of close study and you could see his eyes flick over each dish as it was brought into the restaurant as a hawk does its prey, checking it was up to scratch. This guy has got the important stuff right – quality of food and good service – and knows these are the hallmarks of a decent eaterie.
It’s a shame Omar’s is a little bit further than the other Indian restaurants we frequent, but hey, only a few miles, and well worth the extra journey. We’ll be back!
We paid in full both times and they didn’t know I was a blogger.

Compatibility of Carl Gustav Jung with Monica Potter
Compatibility of Carl Gustav Jung with Monica Potter
Physical 50% Emotional 56% Intellectual 63% Overall 56%
Primary Rhythms
Secondary Rhythms
Overview
Our compatibility charts depict a range of days centered on the target day. The numbers -14, -7, +7, and +14 across the top mark dates ranging from the past to the future. The numbers from +100% (maximum) to -100% (minimum) indicate where the rhythms are on a particular day. In general, a rhythm at 0% is thought to have no real impact on your life, whereas a rhythm at +100% (a high) would give you an edge in that area, and a rhythm at -100% (a low) would make life more difficult in that area. There is no particular meaning to a day on which your rhythms are all high or all low, except the obvious benefits or hindrances that these rare extremes are thought to have on your life.
Compatibility: When looking at the biorhythmic relationship between two people, the key thing to understand is that we are looking at phase compatibility. In other words, 100% physical compatibility between two people does not mean that the relationship will be in a physical high all of the time - it means that all of the highs and lows between those two people will match. With this in mind, it may be clearer that when you look at a biorhythmic compatibility chart, you are looking at the highs and lows of the relationship as a whole.
The three primary biorhythm cycles are:
Emotional: This cycle tracks the stability and positive energy of your psyche and outlook on life, as well as your capacity to empathize with and build rapport with other people.
Intellectual: This cycle tracks your verbal, mathematical, symbolic, and creative abilities, as well as your capacity to apply reason and analysis to the world around you.
Physical: This cycle tracks your strength, health, and raw physical vitality.
The three secondary cycles that derive from the primaries are:
Mastery: This is the composite of the Intellectual and Physical cycles. Mastery encompasses your ability to succeed at tasks and to obtain what you desire. This cycle also tracks athletic ability and the focus required to learn physical skills.
Passion: This is the composite of the Physical and Emotional cycles. Passion encompasses your motivation to act, and the drive that allows you to continue a difficult pursuit. This cycle also tracks sexuality in its purest form.
Wisdom: This is the composite of the Emotional and Intellectual cycles. Wisdom encompasses your understanding of the world, your role in it, and the things that are truly important to your life. This cycle also tracks the presence of mind that you need to make crucial decisions.

Christian Leadership – 10 Godly Character Traits to Overcome Negative Traits
Christian Leadership – 10 Godly Character Traits to Overcome Negative Traits
Godly Character Traits Empower Christian Leaders
Christian leadership should set
the standard for godly character.
Not only that, Christian leaders
should be actively developing
godly character in the lives of others
within their sphere of influence.
It is no surprise that the world today is challenging, and changing, the spiritual values of young and old people alike. Morals are being shaken, and wickedness is growing more and more perverse. The Bible clearly warns that many negative character traits will increase in the last days.
“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”
— 2 Timothy 3:1-5
The following list of negative character traits gives insight into the spirit of our times, and how that spirit is being expressed in our own behavior, thinking, and lifestyle. It gives us some things to reflect on, like a mirror to judge our own behavior with. The list also includes positive, godly character traits used to overcome the negative.
10 Godly Character Traits Overcome Negative Character Traits:
1. Genuine vs Hypocritical
A hypocritical lifestyle is almost the norm as we see people having a form of godliness and going through the religious motions, yet without a genuinely changed life. Hypocrisy is all around us and lies are being spoken to teach false doctrines.
In these perilous times, we should have a healthy fear of the perverse days we are living, and live as genuine believers with renewed minds; trusting God daily. We are not to be conformed to this world, but transformed by the renewing of our minds. (Romans 12:2) A genuine relationship and walk with the Lord is required.
2. Love vs Selfishness
Selfishness and a self-centered, willful pursuit of sin is a common behavior as people become lovers of self. (2 Timothy 3:2) Society has a twisted value system and perspective on life. People have become lovers of pleasure more than of God.
God is love and those who do not love, do not know God. (1 John 4:8) We are to love God and love people.
“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind; and, love your neighbor as yourself.”
— Luke 10:27 NIV
3. Honor vs Disrespect
Disrespect and disobedience to parents, and authority, is a regular part of the spirit of today; rebellion and lawlessness.
However, God tells us to obey and honor our parents. And He even promises that it will be well with us if we do. (Ephesians 6:2-3) We are to be submissive to authority and honor all people, and when we do what is right we find favor with God. (1 Peter 2:13-20)
4. Generosity vs Covetous
Covetousness is ruling the hearts of many. They want things that belong to others and they have a wrong value system. They find themselves not only fond of money, but in love with money.
On the contrary, God tells us the generous will prosper and that if we sow generously, we’ll reap generously.
“A generous man will prosper; he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.”
— Proverbs 11:25 NIV
5. Humility vs Pride
Proud, haughty people, that think they are above others, are filling society. They have an ungodly pride and boast and brag of themselves. But pride comes before the fall.
When we humble ourselves before the Lord, he lifts us up. (James 4:10) Any boasting we do should be in the Lord. (Psalm 34:2)
“God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”
— James 4:6
6. Purity vs Perversion
Perversions of all kinds are rampant today. Anything that is good and natural is being perverted. People seem to have lost their natural, God-given, healthy affection and replaced it with all that is twisted, unnatural, unholy, immoral and perverse; only to satisfy their own desires.
The Bible says in Matthew 5:8, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” We are also to pursue peace and holiness with everyone, without which no one will see the Lord. (Hebrews 12:14)
7. Encouragers vs Despisers
Despisers are in full force; belittling and treating shamefully the righteous actions of those who are doing good. They scoff, mock and ridicule them.
Our words and actions should not be discouraging, but encouraging. God teaches us over and over to encourage and strengthen one another. And we are told to do so even more so in these end times. (Hebrews 10:25)
8. Loyalty vs Traitors
Traitors, truce-breakers, and betrayers lack any sense of loyalty to the commitments of friendship. They are untrue to their promises and can’t be trusted to keep their word. They are liars and false accusers.
Loyalty on the other hand is a mark of true friendship. Proverbs 18:24 tells us there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother. Loyalty, truth, and honesty are godly characters that lead to success. Those who can be trusted with a little can be trusted with much. (Luke 16:10)
9. Gratitude vs Entitlement
An entitlement attitude has taken over and in turn people feel they are owed everything. And on top of that, unthankfulness is sadly ruling the hearts and lives of many. These people ungratefully and unthankfully take advantage of others. And the thing is, this combination of entitlement and unthankfulness is a guaranteed formula for failure.
Gratitude is the attitude of success. It is the grateful and thankful people, that keep their hearts turned toward God, they are the ones who rise to the top. As Christians, we have the ultimate reason to be grateful: for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Therefore we should give God acceptable worship with reverence and awe. (Hebrews 12:28)
“Giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
— Ephesians 5:20 ESV
10. Faith vs Deceit
Deceived and wondering: Are you one that is giving heed to seducing spirits and being led astray from the truth? Take a strong, reflective look at yourself to make sure you haven’t become headstrong in some areas. Is your mind darkened, your thinking reckless, and possibly your pride blinding you? Is your inner conscience seared – is your inner sense of right and wrong fading? Are you losing your sensitivity to the inner promptings of the Holy Spirit through continued sin? Are you backsliding and rejecting God’s plan for your life and experiencing a departure from the faith?
Make basic biblical foundational teachings part of your everyday study and meditation. Renew your mind and grow your faith. Keep your trust in God daily and live by faith!
“Without faith it is impossible to please God.”
— Hebrews 11:6
“The just shall live by faith.”
— Romans 1:17
No doubt about it: Character development comes from discipline and it takes time and dedication; and it needs to be continually cultivated throughout our lives. We must examine ourselves and refuse to let the these negative character traits into our lives. Christian leaders must allow change from the Lord in every area, so that they can minister to others and be a positive example of Christian leadership.
May you be a Christian Leader that abounds with godly character and growing prosperity!

P.S. This article was inspired after reading notes I took from a leadership meeting about character development. We discussed some negative character traits mentioned in Frank Damazio’s book “The Making of a Leader.” (I have not yet read the book, but it was highly recommended.)

Powerful Leadership – 5 Crucial Skills Required to Become a Great Leader!
Powerful Leadership – 5 Crucial Skills Required to Become a Great Leader!
Great Leaders Commit to Developing Key Skills
Powerful leadership requires a commitment
to developing key personal skills and abilities.
Great leaders must have a driving desire
to make things happen.
If you want to be the head and not the tail,
then you must fine tune key leadership skills in order to become effective so that others will want to follow.
Some people are born with natural talents that lend themselves to becoming a great leader. But despite the fact that you might have been born with some of these talents, it still takes continual enthusiasm, drive, and experience for true development as a leader to occur.
5 Crucial Skills Needed to Become a Great Leader
1. Vision
Leaders need to know the vision of their group or organization. They must have a clear sense of purpose. Knowing the organization’s goals and objectives, how the organization works, and being able to communicate the vision to others, helps put everyone on the same page.
Leaders need to help others catch a personal vision of the big picture, so that everyone is moving in the same direction on the road to success.
2. Encouragement
Leadership is not about using harassment or fear as a driving force to get others to take action. Great leaders encourage others to accomplish the goals of the group. Encouragement is contagious and it benefits everyone when it is flowing freely.
3. Trust
Trustworthiness is vital to great leadership. Your followers must have trust and confidence in you. And if they do, they will go to great lengths for you and the group.
Strong relationships, trustworthiness, and high ethics build trust and confidence. Leaders that deal with people in a positive way, lay a foundation of strength for the group. Stronger relationships equal a stronger measure of trust and confidence in the capabilities of the leader.
4. Communication
Communication is crucial skill of a leader. You must be able to clearly communicate the goals and objectives that you are all about to undertake as an organization. A leader’s vision and plan must be clearly communicated to others in order to keep everyone on the same page.
5. Judgment
Great leaders have great judgment. If you want to grow as a leader, you must continue to improve and develop your judgment and decision making skills.
Leaders need to make wise decisions in a variety of situations. Your followers will come to rely on your judgment. Good, wise decision making is crucial to the success of a leader and the organization.
Keep in mind: In life we all eventually find ourselves in a leadership role, in some shape or form, big or small. And the Lord wants to see His children become strong leaders and He gives them instructions and tells them how they can be.
“And the LORD shall make you the head, and not the tail; and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath; if that you listen to the commandments of the LORD your God…to observe and to do them.”
— Deuteronomy 28:13
Conclusion: Leaders lead. Leaders have followers and you’re not much of a leader if no one is following. Being a great leader is about constantly growing, developing, and setting an example, because you are a reflection of what your followers must be. Develop these five crucial skills and demonstrate powerful leadership.
May you develop your skills to grow into a powerful, effective leader and experience much growing prosperity!
Soar higher in Him,
Brenda

Christian Leadership – 7 Attitude Factors You Must Consider If You Want To Be An Excellent Leader
Christian Leadership – 7 Attitude Factors You Must Consider If You Want To Be An Excellent Leader!
Want to be a Christian Leader of Excellence on the Road to Success?
Christian leaders should have a desire to be caring,
supportive, and positive leaders.
They should have a heart to help and serve.
Poor leadership results in hurting the very people
who leaders should be reaching out to help.
Do you want to be a blessing to others and
accomplish what God has called you to do?
Then you need to walk, talk, and lead with the right attitude!
7 Attitude Factors You Must Consider If You Want to Be an Excellent Leader:
1. Attitude Grows From the Inside Out
Attitude takes root inward. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. What is inside of you is going to come out and it will affect people around you; for good or for bad.
2. A Good Attitude Guards Your Words and Heart
As a leader, it is vital to understand the significance of your words and the impact they have on yourself and others. A good attitude keeps a guard on the words spoken and this in turn guards your heart and keeps your heart in the right condition to lead by example.
3. A Proper Attitude Maintains Your Peace
Your attitude is going to be under attack every day, and you need to be prepared to maintain a proper attitude regardless of what happens or what someone says or does. Keeping a proper attitude throughout the day will maintain your peace and further empower you with self-control and other fruits of the Spirit.
4. A Positive Attitude Has Power to Advance You
A positive attitude allows your true self to shine, and this will help advance you. In a world full of darkness and chaos, people are looking to leaders that shine a positive light of hope.
“Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.”
— Winston Churchill
5. Your Attitude Either Draws People to You or Repels Them
Leaders are meant to lead. However, it is hard to lead if you carry a bad attitude that repels people away from you. A good attitude allows people to be drawn to you even in the midst of disagreement.
6. Attitudes Are Contagious
Attitudes are contagious and to be a leader of excellence requires maintaining a proper attitude and at the same time not tolerating a negative contagious spirit to spread and do damage.
“You cannot tailor-make the situations in life, but you can tailor-make the attitudes to fit those situations.”
— Zig Ziglar
7. Your Attitude Projects Your Future
Your attitude reflects what is in you and what is going on in your life. It is also like the prophet of your future. If your attitude is poor and negative and says “nothing ever works out anyway,” it is easy to see what you can expect in your future.
On the other hand, if your attitude is positive, hopeful, and rooted in a heart of love, you are clearly on the road to success and leading others on the way.
Make no mistake about it: Your attitude is a critical factor in your success as a leader. You must consider these seven attitude factors if you want to come to the place where God wants you in the area of Christian leadership.
May your attitude produce abundant results and lead others into a life of growing prosperity!

Successful Leadership – The Power of Teamwork and 4 Keys to Creating a Winning Team!
Successful Leadership – The Power of Teamwork and 4 Keys to Creating a Winning Team!
Successfully Lead a Winning Team and Together Achieve Incredible Things
Successful leaders have discovered
the power of teamwork.
Much can be accomplished when
working together with others.
However, it is not just a numbers game;
the key here is working together.
Getting the job done requires a winning team.
“Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success.”
— John C Maxwell
Teams come in all shapes and sizes; from married couples, or small business partnerships, to large organizations of all sorts. A team not only provides companionship but it helps accomplish goals.
Every team requires a leader, and a successful leader knows that there is power in creating a winning team. However, simply having a team of people can be useless.
On the other hand, developing a winning team multiplies a leader’s value and makes them better than they would be on their own. It enables them to do what they do best and tap into the resources that those on the team do best. Then, incredible things happen and everyone on the team wins.
“Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow…And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.”
— Ecclesiastes 4:9-12
4 Keys to Creating a Winning Team:
1. Develop a Winning Attitude in Team Members
A winning attitude is a positive attitude and must be prevalent. A winning attitude is developed in team members and they believe in their leader, themselves, their teammates, and the vision to be accomplished. Negative thinking is not allowed to creep in and hinder the task at hand.
2. Teach the Value of Personal Development and Character Building
Each team member as an individual must keep improving. Why? Because the highest reward for their efforts isn’t what they get from it, but the person they become because of it. And without personal growth they become a weak individual and a weak link on the team.
3. Empower Teammates
Winners are encouragers and empower each other to be more and do more. They strive to make their teammates more successful. Empowered teammates maintain a thriving atmosphere with an expectancy to win.
4. Instill the Importance of Playing to Win
A successful team plays to win. They know the difference between playing to win and playing not to lose is often the difference between excellence and average. They don’t play to ‘give it a try’, they play to reach their goal; they play to win.
Bottom line: A successful leader understands the power of teamwork and the importance of creating a winning team. They know that by doing so, incredible things happen and everyone wins as they grow and develop individually and as a team.
May you successfully lead a winning team and together achieve much and experience an abundance of growing prosperity!

Brenda

Leadership – How Can the Power of Loyalty in a Leader Result in the Blessings of Success?
Leadership – How Can the Power of Loyalty in a Leader Result in the Blessings of Success?
Loyalty is Required to Reap the Full Reward
Leadership is a powerful directing force for any nation, group, or family.
The quality of a leader greatly impacts the followers and where they end up.
And the power of loyalty is a core element that results in leading the people into success.
Loyalty is a Key Qualification for Leaders
It is often thought, when someone is looking to step into a position, that in order to qualify they need to be the most talented or gifted person for the position. However, it is the loyal and faithful who are the most qualified to be leaders.
It is also thought that the friendly, flashy, outgoing person might be the best one for the job. But do not make the mistake in thinking that. A core requirement for leadership is loyalty and faithfulness and not anything else. A loyal person can be taught the skills needed for the job.
“It is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.”
— 1 Corinthians 4:2
Loyalty is Required to Reap the Full Reward
Success comes to the loyal and faithful ones. One day we all hope to hear those famous words: “Well done, good and faithful servant.”
In the good times everyone seems loyal. Those who remain supportive through the difficult times are different from those who come in when everything is working well. No doubt, loyalty is most appreciated in hard times.
Loyalty Needed for a Successful Team of People
One person can only do so much. Growing success requires building a loyal team of people. In fact, no team will be strong and effective if they are not loyal.
It would actually be better to work alone than with a team of disloyal, disgruntled, and disunited people. One disloyal person breeds strife, hatred, and murmuring like smoke that quickly fills the whole house. Whenever there is distrust and disloyalty, the people are on guard and stray away.
Effective leaders exhibit loyalty and faithfulness. People are attracted by genuine love and commitment and repelled by disunity and discord. Loyal leaders influence their followers to be an effective and loyal team of people, who in turn create loyal successors.
Bottom line: Those who benefit from the blessings of success are the faithful and loyal ones. Without loyalty every organization constantly undergoes disintegration. Loyal leaders build loyal teams that remain committed in the good times and bad so that all can benefit from the blessings of success.
May you be a loyal and faithful leader and enjoy a life of growing prosperity!
Be blessed to be a blessing –
Cheers,
Brenda

Powerful Leadership – A Positive Attitude in Leaders Produces Results in More Ways Than One!
Powerful Leadership – A Positive Attitude in Leaders Produces Results in More Ways Than One!
A Valuable Leadership Skill Worth Improving!
Leadership skills are valuable and always worth improving.
As a leader grows and develops, it not only helps improve their life, but the lives of those around them.
A key skill to develop and maintain is a positive attitude.
Why?
Men and women rise and fall everyday because of their attitude.
“Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.”
— Thomas Jefferson
Positive Attitude – The Critical Factor in Leadership
If you really want to go anywhere as a leader, you have to examine your attitude! Whatever attitude you accept at this time is a critical factor in determining the success or failure of your future.
Too often people never come to a place of leadership where God wants them. Or they don’t produce the results that are expected, because of a negative attitude. A leader may want God to use them, but He is saying “No” because of their sour, nasty attitude. A negative attitude will hinder a leaders potential.
And don’t be one that points the finger of blame at others, especially as a leader. Each persons attitude is their own responsibility.
Often times, people with bad attitudes don’t know that they have one. But if you are a leader and find yourself pointing the finger of blame at others regularly, that may be a great reason to examine the condition of your own thoughts and heart.
Positive Attitude – Helping Leaders Produce Positive Results
Understand that the attitude a leader has toward how they view and handle things, will determine the results they produce. As long as a leader is viewing things negatively, they are going to get negative results.
Leaders should not let other people govern their production and outcome. Leaders must have an “I can” attitude. Many people miss opportunities and promotions that God has for them, because they let someone else determine their attitude.
Of course as a leader, challenges are always going to come and attempt to get you to accept a bad or negative attitude. But remember it is a critical factor to have a positive, ‘I can’ attitude about what you are doing in order to produce positive results.
The results not only show up in the life of the leader, but in the life of those being led. This is the case whether it is a leadership role in a family, ministry, or business. You can make a difference.
“When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked rule, the people mourn.”
— Proverbs 29:2
Bottom line: A leaders attitude will create results. It is up to the leader to choose the attitude they will put on for the results they desire. A leadership role should require a positive attitude and one that produces positive results.
May you be a leader that maintains a positive attitude and a life of growing prosperity!
God bless you –
Cheers,
Brenda

Christian Leadership: How Can a Spirit of Excellence in Leaders Bring Growing Prosperity?
Christian Leadership: How Can a Spirit of Excellence in Leaders Bring Growing Prosperity?
Powerful Leaders Choose a Spirit of Excellence!
Leaders should continually strive for a spirit of excellence, especially Christians.
As leaders, we must pursue excellence all along our journey of life and not think of it as a destination.
Maintaining a spirit of excellence creates positive results and growing prosperity.
We serve a God of excellence and we should desire to have excellence come out of us.
“O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth!”
— Psalm 8:1
A Lack of Excellence Equals a Lack of Prosperity
Not everyone has had the privilege of being raised in an environment that operated in a spirit of excellence. Too often chaos and confusion are the norm. A lack of excellence in an environment tends to create a victim’s mentality in people.
How on earth can progress be made when the conduct of a leader or group is lazy, slothful and non-committed?
Where there is no commitment to excellence, there is no promotion or growing prosperity. People may seek excellence and prosperity in life, but nothing is going to happen until the excuses and victim mentality stops.
People, whether they know it or not, are looking for excellence, and it should be required in leaders.
A Spirit of Excellence Brings Promotion
Excellence always takes us to another level and causes things to happen. If we want more, we have to be determined to shake off a slothful spirit and put on an excellent spirit; in order to bring out our full potential.
Excellence often requires doing something we have never done before. It requires us to stretch in all areas of our personal growth. This does not go unnoticed to others or God. Leaders that have a spirit of excellence will get God’s attention and allow Him to take them to another level.
We see examples of this all throughout the Bible and throughout history. Take a look at how Daniel was promoted because of an excellent spirit.
“Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.”
— Daniel 6:3
Excellence is something leaders must continually work on and strive to improve and develop in themselves. Keep in mind; none of us are perfect and have it all together. This area of life, like all others, requires that we seek God daily for His help.
Believe me. As a leader, there might be areas in your life that other people don’t think you excel at, but once you start working and striving towards a life of excellence others will take notice. You will grow as a leader, and just like Daniel, you will find that a powerful spirit of excellence puts you in position for promotion!
May you continually pursue a spirit of excellence and experience a life of growing prosperity.
God bless you –
Cheers,
Brenda
P.S. Has there been a time in your life you experienced a promotion because you were operating with a spirit of excellence? If so, feel free to share and encourage others…

Leadership – Do You Utilize these Top 3 Powerful Skills?
Leadership – Do You Utilize these Top 3 Powerful Skills?
Discover the Top 3 Powerful Skills of Successful Effective Leaders!
Leadership is required in many different arenas of life.
A small number of people seem to be born with a built in set of skills for being an effective leader and it comes naturally to them. However, for the majority of people, study and training is required to bring out the true leader in them.
It has been said that “The person who says he is leading but has no followers is only taking a walk.”
That being said, I would also add that good leaders require good followers.
Effective leaders teach their followers how to step up and be all that they can be. As others imitate a leader, and follow their steps, growth and progress should come to the organization as a whole.
Top 3 Powerful Skills for Effective Leadership:
1.) VISION – It is vital that a leader be a person of vision. If you do not have a clear vision of where you are headed and what you plan to accomplish, how can you expect to get yourself and others there?
This type of vision is actually a spiritual vision.
When the Bible talks about vision it is about what will be; not what we see. Spiritual vision equals seeing what will be. Natural vision equals seeing what already is.
We are told that vision comes from God and that it should be written down and made clear to others. That way everyone can grab hold of it and run with it. (Habakkuk 2:1-2) It is vitally important that you stay focused on the vision.
2.) PLANNING & PREPARATION – Another key skill of an effective leader is the ability to plan. Before you start something; plan, make preparation, and look ahead.
What is the long-term impact of what you are about to do? Sit down and count the cost. Fully consider the project you are about to take on to be sure you can complete it.
Planning and preparation helps fulfill the vision. It is never wasted time. Learn to plan ahead, prepare, and be organized.
3.) PRAYER – Great leaders that stand the test of time are leaders that pray. Prayer is not just for your personal life, but also for your employment, business, family, school, etc.
In everything we do it should be by prayer. (Philippians 4:6)
Why would you not want to be built up spiritually before you do anything? In everything you do; be prepared in prayer and get God involved.
Keep in mind: Your vision may be so big that it seems impossible to ever attain it. Remember though, that vision tends to run in advance of your ability to fulfill it.
As a leader you have strength that can be tapped into through the resource of prayer. When God is your partner, nothing is impossible!
Your next step? Take what you have just learned and whether you are a leader of a business organization, or any type of group, ministry, or family begin to grow in these key skills. Start applying these powerful skills in your life and watch yourself become a successful leader.
May your leadership skills improve and your life overflow with growing prosperity!
Cheers,
Brenda

Plot Summary:
"Gay sex buddies Nathan and Justin are united by their passion for slasher, vigilante, serial killer and zombie films. Bored and frustrated with their lives as students at an obscure college in impoverished New Haven, Connecticut, they decide to teach a self-important classmate, Andy, a lesson by raping him. The drug-fuelled incident goes awry and Andy dies. High on the thrill of their first killing, Nathan and Justin decide to pay a visit to nearby Ivy University to wreak more havoc on the elite campus. What follows is a harrowing and bloody tale of homo-cidal mania."

Tweet
T.S. Slaughter’s debut feature film sees gay couple Nathan and Justin tire of their daily lives and when even sex becomes boring for them, they decide to take their anger at life out on an obnoxious fellow student. The plan (inspired by a news story Nathan heard) is simple, drug the guy and rape him for kicks, but when he accidentally dies, the guys take a liking to the idea of killing and set out to continue their plan on a bunch of Ivy League jocks who have previously wronged them.
Skull & Bones is well made there is no denying that. So I was particularly surprised to learn that this was Producer/Director of Photography Paul Serrano’s first time working with DV. The film also features some decent acting and some dreadful acting. The biggest flaw in my humble opinion is that tonally, the film is all over the place. Starting out quite eerily, S&B descends into camp at every available opportunity and whilst this works and is indeed entertaining, it essentially destroys what could have been a quite creepy vibe. It also leaves the viewer confused and slightly disturbed, as we are essentially being asked to laugh at rape, torture and murder. As if that isn’t bad enough it also delves way too deeply into (one can only assume) Writer/Director T.S. Slaughter’s personal social and political views. I couldn’t help but think that he has a huge chip on his shoulder as his characters really went to town on the fact that they are viewed differently and shunned by other more prominent social/political groups. This in my opinion will really alienate straight audiences who perhaps may not be able to relate.
Skull & Bones eeks a lot out of its meager budget and comes up trumps in the looks department. It is also carried well by the two leads with Derrick Wolf in particular doing a very convincing job. It’s light and bright and moves quickly.
OVERALL SUMMARY
In the end, this is a well shot and thought out feature that does have more going for it than just surface value. Unfortunately, it is too damn smart for it’s own good and the casual horror fan will perhaps find it too heavy.

Cease-and-Desist letters as self-executing copyright bombs
Posted on August 13, 2016 by Ron Coleman
Written by: Ron Coleman
Originally posted 2007-10-13 23:50:07. Republished by Blog Post Promoter
Techdirt reports (thanks, Pennywit!) on a law firm that tells recipients of its questionable “C&D” letters that if they dare post them, they’ll be liable for copyright infringement. This is the law firm, and this is the letter. And this is the response. (And here’s the definitive treatment, via the Citizen Media Law Project).
A very good lawyer taught me, as a young pup, that you should never put anything on your legal stationery you’re not prepared to use, or see the other side use, as an exhibit to a motion — i.e., ask yourself, “What will the judge think when he reads this?” Now the question is a lot broader, as is the advice: Don’t write a so-called “lawyer’s letter” that you’re not prepared for the whole world to see.
Some more homey advice: Don’t make threats you can’t back up. And don’t try making a bomb just to have it blow up in your face.
UPDATE: The other shoe drops. Are you moved? Pennywit writes: “I’m actually quite surprised at the intense personal tone of parts of it; wouldn’t even a minimum amount of professionalism mandate a certain detachment?”

Copyright Law

I thought copyright protection is secured upon creation of the work (in this case, the C&D letter). Am I mistaken? Registration is no longer a requirement for copyright protection.
The irony is if someone reprints your letter, then you may actually meet the “publication” criteria for copyright protection, too–that you “published” the letter to the recipient with intent for redistribution. However, does such a publication confer the rights to the recipient to publically perform the copyright protected work? I don’t think so …
IMHO, IANAL, etc., a C&D letter ought to receive copyright protection as soon as it’s authored, and publishing such a letter in whole (sadly) should constitute an infringing use. Of course, Fair Use should also apply here and quoting select parts of the copyrighted work (the C&D letter) for purpose of commentary ought to be fair use–but reproduction in whole is certainly infringing.
This is why I’m so glad I’m not a software developer and lawyer–lawyers can’t make up their minds–computers don’t have one. You are either right or wrong, and the computer tells you so.
Ron Coleman
October 14, 2007 at 8:40 pm
Copyright does indeed vest as soon as the work is fixed, but, oddly enough, you have no right to sue for infringement (or to collect attorneys’ fees or statutory damages) unless and until you have a registration.
You are also right that a letter from A to B is technically protected by copyright (though, again, without a registration that’s not much protection), Dossy. But it is necessary to go through the fair use analysis under copyright law to understand why publication would in fact be permitted, i.e., not actionable.
Dossy Shiobara
October 14, 2007 at 9:37 pm
What I’d like to know is whether it’s “enough” protection to effect a DMCA takedown notice. Or, as you say, reproduction of the C&D letter in whole meets fair use criteria.
I guess until something like this is tested in a court of law, we’ll never really know for sure. Thanks for kicking the idea around with me, though.
Bob Cumbow
October 15, 2007 at 7:21 pm
CMLP’s pat assertion that republication of the letter “would be fair use” is a bit conclusory. As you mentioned to Dossy, below, fair use analysis is a process, not a simple assertion. Stupid of the firm, though, to send a letter saying that republication of the letter wold result in “further legal action” for copyright infringement without taking care to register the copyright first. They could still register it later and sue–but no statutory damages, and no costs/fees, and I doubt they’d be able to show much in the way of actual damages.

Thanks for this post, Ron. Most enlightening and symptomatic, I think, of the problems we are all experiencing as a result of the shift in the means of artistic production and distribution (i.e., Radio Head & my own much less successful but nevertheless working artist and musician friends here in Los Angeles.
Fear seems to be the primary driver of the recording industry’s attempts to protect its “turf” — an emotion that interfers with the higher cognitivie functions necessary to solve new technological problems with new business methods.
I’d categorize the type of dispute you chronicle here (together with the ones Mr. Dozier is fighting) as forms of cyber-bullying.
Perhaps more pernicious a form of consumer bullying is addessed by my recent post on the RIAA’s $200K-plus jury verdict agaisnt a single mother of two with an income of approximately $36K/year.
I’d love to hear what your readers say about my abbreviated response to that verdict here: http://www.ipadrblog.com/articles/ip-adr-dictionary/.
Thanks as always. I’m a daily and much appreciative reader.
Best,
Vickie
The Title, the Blog and the Blogger
The question of whether consumers are likely to be confused is the signal inquiry that determines if a trademark infringement claim is valid. I write here about trademark law, copyright law, brands, free speech (mostly as it relates to the Internet) and legal issues related to blogging. That may sound like a lot, but it's just a blog.

Potential changes include adding sugary beverages — which received 9.25 percent of all expenditures of food stamp money, second only to meat — to the list of items consumers cannot purchase with food stamps, allowing food stamps for online grocery purchases, and creating policy measures to prevent food-stamp fraud and loopholes.

President’s Budget Seeks Devastating Cuts to Health Programs
“This budget goes against our nation’s deeply held belief in our shared humanity,” said Kathy Ko Chin, APIAHF president and CEO. “The proposed cuts would devastate efforts to help keep families and communities across the country healthy.”

Asian Americans Advancing Justice Denounces the White House Budget
“The White House budget would cut trillions in investments for families to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy and a harmful mass deportation agenda to tear countless families apart and create terror in communities across the United States. Our immigration enforcement and mass incarceration system is rampant with abuse. Funding should be used to reform broken systems instead of increasing monies for incarceration and immigration enforcement activities that operate with no checks and balances.

APALA Condemns Latest White House Budget
“We are not surprised by this budget – it confirms everything we have seen and knew would continue to happen,” stated Johanna Puno Hester, APALA National President and Assistant Executive Director of the United Domestic Workers, AFSCME Local 3930. “Our broken criminal injustice system already disproportionately impacts communities of color. With the government’s blessing for more agents and more detention beds, the private prison industry will continue to profit on the incarceration of Black and Brown bodies.”

President Trump’s 2018 Budget Attacks Vulnerable Communities
President Trump’s FY 2018 budget reaffirms the sentiment that our communities are not important to this Administration. While hard-working Americans families are being deprived of the programs they need to survive, this Administration is also planning to provide major tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. Federal investments in affordable housing would be cut by nearly 15% compared to FY 2017 through overall decreased funding to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

It's winter - stay warm out there!

My climbing partners and I rode a train into the canyon, it stopped in the middle of nowhere and we jumped out. The conductor said “Good luck, we’re coming back on Tuesday. Be ready.”

The 3 Most Important Pieces of Equipment
Nicholas Bratton
August 25, 2018
Let’s focus on the basics: what do you really need for your sport? In my time as a guide and outdoor athlete on three continents I learned a few simple truths. Here is one: there are three pieces of gear worth investing in and everything else is secondary. Based on 25 years in the mountains, here is my take on the top three gear choices you will make.

Project: Land Rover custom door panel
Nicholas Bratton
January 29, 2017
The stock door panel on a Discovery covers a lot of real estate but doesn’t offer much function beside a pocket and a subwoofer. I wanted to replace this with a panel that would expand the utility of the cargo space. Let’s be honest: my days of alpine climbing are mostly behind me and I spend more time car camping (also known to some as “overlanding”) these days than I do shivering on Mount Rainier.

Project: Land Rover cargo space shelf
Nicholas Bratton
January 8, 2017
My dog, Bastien, loves to travel and camp. He knows it’s time for an adventure when I start loading gear into the Land Rover. It can be challenging to pack equipment into the cargo space in a way that is comfortable and safe for the dog while also convenient for me to access.

What I love most about this record is the feeling of intimacy – it’s heartfelt, it’s revealing, and the arrangements are complex. It sounds like they are right there in the room, performing just for you. This could be my favorite record of the year.

By excluding homosexuals you are espousing the value that it is acceptable to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. What kind of value is that? A morally crooked one. I believe that homosexuality in no way detracts from or disqualifies a person from being able to live and embody the ideals of Scouting.

We switched off the engine and observed in silence as he approached us, walked within a couple of meters of the Land Rover, and settled down with some delicious foliage nearby. For half an hour we sat there, watching each other. This was a magical Tembe moment.

Climbing to the sky
Nicholas Bratton
May 10, 2015
On my last visit to Sani Pass I had been a passenger and was now looking forward to driving the route. The road climbed steeply up to the head of a valley. Above us to the right were the cliffs known as the 12 Apostles. The road was narrow, only a car's width for much of the way, with nothing between the edge and a long drop off.

Unexpected diversions
Nicholas Bratton
April 27, 2015
Wednesday we decided to take another two-pronged assault on Table Mountain. I would take the bus back to Kirstenbosch, hike up, and meet Jenna at the upper cable station after she had the morning to walk around town. The "tablecloth" was enveloping the mountain, a thick shroud of cloud that rolls in from the Atlantic and dissipates around the edges of the plateau. From the gardens I could see a thick blanket of cloud stretching out to the southeast, meaning a hike would be completely socked in. I made a quick change of plan and found the quickest way back to town.
I took a metered taxi from the garden down to the main road in Newlands, then hopped on a minibus taxi back to Cape Town's civic centre. The taxi ride had nearly the full complement of quotidian drama: I was wedged in between a large woman and the door, the barker hung out the door shouting, the driver casually wove through moving traffic, narrowly avoiding numerous collisions, playing his horn like jazz trumpeter. There was an entire language spoken by hoots.
Rejoining Jenna we adapted our plans. The mountain was not meant to happen on this trip. Instead we walked along High Level road to explore the Bo Kaap neighborhood. This area is characterised by brightly-painted houses lining the streets. The colourful palette of buildings is a relatively recent transformation of the neighborhood, but it has a longer history of being a home to Cape Malays. We learned some history of the quarter in the small museum and breathed deeply of the exotic aromas across the street in the Atlas spice trader's.
Jenna wanted to visit the District 6 museum, so we walked west with a break at a balcony cafe overlooking Long Street for a cup of rooibos. District 6 is an area of prime real estate just outside of downtown that had been populated by minority groups during apartheid. In the 1980s the government began a systematic relocation campaign to move its residents to far-flung suburbs and redevelop the area for whites. It was a sad period of local history and the museum is a beautiful tribute to the spirit of the community that had emerged organically in District 6 prior to relocation.

Marching Band News
MPA, October 14th 2017
ALL Marching Band rehearsals (including band camp), football games, and competition dates for the upcoming summer and fall season have been entered into our online band calendar. Click the "Resources" menu and drag down to "CHARMS/Band Calendar".
Please be aware that attendance at each rehearsal is what enables us to be successful, and that students should make arrangements to schedule additional commitments around our pre-set schedule whenever possible.
School Rehearsal Schedule - Fall 2018
Monday afternoons - 3:30-4:30p (alternate Brass and Woodwinds only - See CHARMS calendar)
Tuesday evening - 6:00-9:00p (full ensemble)
Thursday evening - 6:00-9:00p (full ensemble)
2018-2019 Band Commitment Form (includes summer band rehearsal dates)*
*This form is required of all students wishing to enroll in the band program for the 2018-2019 school year.
"The Pride of the Red, White, and Blue" Marching Band
With over 245 members, the marching band is the most active and visible part of the Pace High School band program. This includes all wind instruments*, percussion and color guard members. Within the Pace High Band Program, membership in the marching band is a required portion of our overall music curriculum. Students must also remain enrolled in a band, percussion, or color guard class during the entire school year to maintain their membership in this ensemble.
This ensemble is competitive on a local, state, and national level. In order to maintain this prestigious high standard, marching band members follow a strict rehearsal and performance schedule each summer and fall. Rehearsal dates are posted on CHARMS and can be found in the current Band Handbook. This ensemble performs at all home and away football games, pep rallies, statewide/national competitions, and several local parades. Additional performances will be announced well in advance, and students will be expected to make all efforts to be in attendance.
Due to the strict quality of sound that we strive to achieve each year, only the following wind instruments will be utilized on the marching band field: piccolo (selected through flute audition only), flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, alto sax, tenor sax, trumpet, mellophone, trombone, baritone, and sousaphone. Students who do not currently play one of those instruments have options to switch to a different instrument, perform with the front ensemble, or join the color guard.
Why Is Marching Band Important?
This performance ensemble provides a “society” and “family” to which all band students can belong. It is a place where they learn values and standards, where they can learn to depend on one another in their pursuit of excellence. They learn about responsibility, doing their fair share, and sticking to a common goal. They learn to value people, respect their peers and not make judgments on the superficial. They frequently acquire a stronger base for their adult life than any other avenue open to them.
In the Pace High Band program, each and every student is encouraged to strive to be their absolute best at each rehearsal and performance. Our students carry what they learn in marching band with them for the rest of their lives!

I would love love love it if they changed to the unofficial snake logo, although it would look like they were copying the Philadelphia Union (really it's the other way around).
I would settle for making the stripes and the star background the right colors for how they appear on the flag...

Yeah, the nautical stars don't really make sense... And the snake logo is definitely very much used (I know it was a big debate/snafu about whether Nike had copyright on the snake logo or not) Maybe we should honor Ben Franklin's other famous love and put a wild turkey on the logo...

Hahahaha, I'm really shocked that wasn't my intended allusion... (Besides Wild Turkey was always more of R54s poison of choice.)
I will say, however, that after waking up to a large tom screaming at me through a sliding glass door that maybe these birds are terrifying enough to be our natural symbol (I mean Eagles mainly eat detritus, how noble is that?)

The kit is out too.
If you ignore the good looks that apparently run in the Nash family and concentrate on the design you will note that it is pretty nice, especially considering some of the things adidas has come out with lately.

The Good Place – Season 2
The Good Place – Season 2
February 6, 2018

This Could Be… Heaven?
Diving headlong into its high concept without ever once dropping the ball, The Good Place‘s second season cements it as one of the cleverest and most compassionate shows on television. What’s more, its constant, madcap humour proves it has just about the strongest ensemble and staff of comedy writers around.
Rating: 9/11
When you make a show about the afterlife, you tend to lose a lot of cards that you can usually play in more worldly stories. A narrative need stakes, threats and consequences to thrive, all of which are encountered by the story’s characters over the course of their lives. But in The Good Place everyone’s already dead, they’ve all been judged based on their actions on Earth and now have wound up in a cosmic paradise. With that premise, it’s hard to imagine much conflict arising, which suggests there mightn’t be any central drive to the show.
Here’s where things get complicated, though: the titular Good Place (aka Heaven) that all of the human characters believe themselves to be in is, in fact, the Bad Place (aka Hell… duh). As a revolutionary form of torture, these humans were deceived into thinking that they belonged in the Good Place, while secretly they were being pitted against one another and forced to make their own afterlives miserable. As far as thematic groundwork goes, this helps to provide an interesting commentary on how deluded our self-perceptions usually are, as well as how arbitrary the process of judging the goodness of others can be.
More importantly, though, this shake-up that ended The Good Place‘s first season paved the way for its spectacular second season, which concluded last Friday. This time around, the characters were no longer faced with the dilemmas of trying to live up to an idealised afterlife, or dealing with the fact that they were all kinda bummed out about how suspiciously flawed that afterlife turned out to be. Instead, each of them was forced to come to terms with how they were super shitty people – whether directly or passively – during their time on Earth. Eleanor (Kristen Bell) was lazy, manipulative and cruel, Chidi (William Jackson Harper) was so indecisive that he routinely ruined others’ lives, Tahani (Jameela Jamil) was vain and vindictive and Jason (Manny Jacinto) was and remains, honest to God, the dumbest human being in existence, which led him to some pretty awful decisions.
As an additional complication, this season Michael (Ted Danson) – the Bad Place overseer who initially posed as something of an angel – is struggling with his own shortcomings. His deceptive form of torture has already failed once, largely due to Eleanor’s unpredictable selflessness and, later, her shrewdness. Now, he’s backed into a position where, no matter how many times he erases the core characters’ memories and tries the whole charade again, they keep figuring out that they’re in the Bad Place. He’s tried this very move 802 times to be exact, and still no success. What’s more, as it has been made clear to Michael by his superiors that his continued failings will have eternal consequences, he now has no choice for redemption other than joining these four humans on their ill-advised attempts to escape the Bad Place.
This choice by Michael, and the necessity of it, have become the bedrock of The Good Place. To start with, because this latest season was less concerned with the show’s central mystery than the first season, it allowed more time for the characters to grow in the realised environment. Now that they know they’ve been relegated to eternal damnation, the human characters have to exhibit more self-awareness and conscientiousness in order to flourish. And, against all odds, when these stupendously bad (or, at least, thoughtless) people are brought together, they begin to improve. Instead of provoking and torturing one another in the way that Michael intended, they can’t help but bring out the best in each other.
As Chidi’s ethics student, Eleanor begins to retain many of the complex and varied approaches to moral philosophy he dishes out. In the process, she examines her past and present behaviour and is able to identify the insecurities that keep her from forming meaningful relationships. Chidi, meanwhile, is made to reconcile with the fact that his decisions impact others, mostly through Eleanor’s mocking treatment of his indecisiveness. This dynamic comes to a head as Eleanor and Chidi discover that – in several past iterations of themselves in Michael’s many different versions of the Good Place – they actually fell in love, which leads to an identity crisis for the love-averse Eleanor and an ethical one for Chidi, who isn’t sure that he feels the same way.
Tahani, for her part, forms an unlikely attachment with Jason, a man so dim-witted that the summary of his behaviour every episode could be “Jason remains oblivious.” Yet his stupidity masks a strange and unaffected kindness, as well as a total disregard for what others might think of him, which is exactly the kind of salve Tahani needs. If I’m being honest, I’m not sure that Jason in and of himself actually makes any strides towards betterment; he’s just such a freewheeling, stoner goldfish of a character that he becomes less terrible when he’s surrounded by people who will help him make better choices.
All of this functions wonderfully to fulfill one of the favoured tropes of The Good Place‘s creator Michael Schur: the wayward, unlikely family that grow into a formidable alliance. It was there on his previous show in the civil servitude of Parks and Recreation, and you can see it in the quirky police precinct of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It’s somehow even more impressive on The Good Place, though, because the obstacles and hardships that bond the characters require such a pristine suspension of disbelief. See, regardless of your religious or spiritual inclinations, having Heaven, Hell and Purgatory as settings in a TV show should rob it of all credibility, not to mention it undercuts the biggest consequence that could possibly befall the already-deceased characters.
Yet, even in these inflated circumstances, The Good Place finds room for relatable troubles. Whether it’s the incessant love triangles that are bound to pop up whenever a group of attractive single people are brought together, or an eternal being like Michael somehow having to wrap his head around the existential quandary of death, basically every episode of the show ekes laughter and pathos from its characters’ shortcomings. What’s more, without getting soppy or treacly, it asks us to imagine a reality in which being a better person doesn’t need to come at the expense of your own happiness. Sometimes, all it takes is a willing group of people and someone to ask the right question: What do we owe to each other?

Haining Open – Starts Monday
October 18, 2015 October 18, 2015 matt2745	5 Comments
The snooker tour resumes tomorrow with the start of this year’s Haining Open, an event won last season by Stuart Bingham who now has an impressive four Asian Tour titles to his name.

October 16, 2015 October 17, 2015 matt2745	Leave a comment

As regular readers will be well aware, to fully understand how each of the current tour players are currently placed, it is necessary to analyse a number of different ranking lists and orders of merit.
With two of the biggest money events to come in the International Championship and UK Championship tournaments, today I take my first player-by-player look at the current state of play and flag up some of the surprise names with work to do if they are to remain on tour for another season…

Tell It To Venus
Tell It To Venus is for those who still have hope in love and relationships; even in the current and often discouraging environment in which we live. An environment that appears to offer a slim chance of having a healthy and happy relationship, or any possibility of marriage. We are still encouraged. We understand how easy it is to become tired and discouraged; Tell It To Venus is here to listen.

Dear Court (Courtney):
Where should I start? There’s so much I want to say to you. First let me say that I’m really proud of the woman you are. You’re not my baby, but you’ll always be my baby. Okay so out of 23 years we’ve only had a few disagreements. They were BIG, but only a few. Remember that time we had that argument about Kurtis and you call yourself telling on me? You called Daddy remember? Didn’t you get a surprise? You’ve got to respect the fact that although Daddy lives in Kansas City and we live in Chicago he has never disrespected my decisions or questioned my authority when it came to you. I love him for that.
I had the guiltiest feeling when I decided to divorce Daddy. I felt that I was doing you a disservice. About to turn 5; in all your wisdom telling me how this was for the better, and that you felt better and so should I. I didn’t realize until we were out of the situation; how much pressure you were under. Constantly checking on me and asking if I was okay. You did the same for Daddy. You’re a good child.
I could go on but, let’s get back to the purpose of this letter. Courtney, I know you are crazy about Nana, and you should be. My Mother has helped raise you and been your saving grace. It’s hard to be the perfect example of motherhood when you still need your Mommy. We both know I still need my Mommy. lol She is the woman and person I most admire, and I know she is the same for you.
As a parent you wish your child only saw you at your best, but unfortunately you’ve seen me at my lowest. There have been times you’ve seen me in the depths of depression. It may not seem like it, but you were the only reason I decided to wake up. Relationships? I haven’t always been the shining example of perfection. I promised myself that I wasn’t going to bring anyone around you unless it was serious. Wow, I actually thought they were serious?! Whatever criteria I was using has got to change.
One thing you know is that Daddy and I love each other, but more importantly we LOVE you! You represent the best of the two of us. You are perfection in our eyes. Here’s the experience and lesson I want you to get from me: LOVE YOURSELF!!! Of course, LOVE of GOD is always first, and then it’s LOVE of SELF. I know you love your family. You show it every day in all the things you do. But it is most important to LOVE YOU! The depression, the bad relationships, the indecisiveness, would all have gone away if only I knew how to LOVE myself. That means a lot of things Co. It means having a respect for yourself that allows you to honor your body and who you are at all times. That means not making decisions to pacify others, but doing whatever is in your best interest and not feeling guilty about it.
As a parent we want our children to be better than us. You were better than me, smarter than me, all those things better than me a long time ago. I’m thankful to GOD for that. You have been my protector when I should have been yours. You’ve been my parent when I should have been yours. You’ve been a sister, a best friend, and a confidant, and you’re still my child. I couldn’t ask for better. I’m proud that GOD chose me to be your Mother. So if I could share one thing that could save your life and make for a happier life it would be to LOVE YOURSELF! I LOVE you, Daddy LOVES you, and Nana LOVES you. Anyone who knows you LOVES you, but most important is that YOU LOVE YOU!
Question: If you could share one experience with a young man or woman that could save their life what would it be? Would you hesitate to share the experience even if it made you look weak or vulnerable?

A man called Point... July 9, 2010 at 2:39 PM
Would you limit me to just one Veela?!
I share many of my experiences with my daughter. That's part of what we parents do.
Nothing I could share with her makes me feel weak. I am stronger for having gained each experience and for being able to guide and groom her through sharing them.

all i can say to that story veela is WOW. thats a great story and it sounds like its about you and your daughter. i don't have any kids and i haven't been in a serious relationship in almost 10 years. i been through a lot and i felt i wasn't ready to be involved with anyone. 10 yrs ago, i was almost married to a woman who i thought was the love of mt life. i was dead wrong. like they say: You live and learn. i gave 100% of my heart and soul to this woman and she stepped on it like a grape. i am ove it now but for about 3 or 4 years, i dwelled in it and it was really effecting me. then i started doing bad drugs and working while on drugs. it was depressing, bad, stupid, and it made me look really bad. it also cost me my career that i worked so hard for. I was a professional drum technician and was touring with various famous artist from around the world. i am originally from Chicago but currently residing in San Francisco. when i came here, i said to myself that i was gonna be a famous drummer and audio technician. i was young and dumb. i moved here in 1994 with a vision, my clothes, a drum kit and some deejay gear. i had sold everything else in chi. i knew i was more than ready for this. after all that. me and my ex met after living here for a year. we ended up living together after 4 months of dating. we stayed together for almost 5 years. my heart was broken, i was depressed. living alone in a 3 bedroom apartment wasn't fun. so i did the ultimate i sank myself into the production industry so intense that it landed me a tour after a year. i mean 18hour days 7 days a week with very little sleep. non-stop work and partying. mixing bands, setting up shows, performances with my band. were 3 or 4 times a month. i was on fire. my family was trippin because i came here and just jumped right in the mix of meeting people and making things happen. after a year the band was touring and we did a few shows in chicago. that was cool. a good time. anyway. what i am saying is. now that i am in my 40s and have changed my whole lifestyle. no more drugs, partying all night (well once in awhile i go to a friends house)but other than that. my life is based around playing drums now. its all i think about as well as women. there are so many beautiful women in this city that it makes me crazy. all nationalities. everything and most of them love the brothas...you know. LOL. Now..today i am a decent looking man with a good heart, no kids, drama, a free spirit who's also a good dresser and i love to smell good for the ladies. I still play drums like there's no tomorrow. (Sick with it)its who i am. the reason i live here. In 15 years. i have played in about 15 bands...almost some touring some not. mostly local punk rock, fusion, metal, classic rock, cover bands, blues bands. to mee it all became very boring. i am into the whole groove thing (jill scott, talib kweli,common,ramsey lewis). ok anyway is there hope for me in finding my true love. i need to know this as i am getting discouraged. ?

LOOK AT GOD! COACHING CLIENT PENS NEW BOOK ABOUT HIS FAMOUS MOTHER, MARVA COLLINS by Richard Cuff
May 29, 2017
Look at God!! A former coaching client referred Patrick Collins to me for my Get Ready for Greatness Executive Coaching Series. Patrick is the son of world renowned Civil Rights activist and educator Marva Collins who was portrayed by Cicely Tyson in the made-for-tv movie - The Marva Collins Story.
After the first few coaching sessions, Patrick presented me with the honor of editing his new book - Learning Curve; Living in the shadow of Marvin Collins. He and I are now joining forces by combining my work in early childhood music education with his international early childhood education advocacy effort. He has agreed to serve as chairman of our board as we create the Marva Collins Foundation and the Marva Collins Early Childhood Education Scholarship Fund. The Marva Collins Foundation will be operating out of Chicago, IL where I am now opening a second office for CTI Marketing and the Marva Collins Scholarship will become part of our Cora Lee Cuff Fund here in Jacksonville, FL…

TRANSFORMATIONS BY VEELA: HOW I CAN HELP YOU CHANGE YOUR LIFE!

TRANSFORMATIONS BY VEELA
I’ve invested my time and experience into being a blessing. Here is an eBook I created: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GZH1SLQ - I would appreciate you visiting my website: TRANSFORMATIONS BY VEELA. If you do there is a free online course (GET HAPPY!) and another bonus awaiting you.
MY COACHING PHILOSOPHY
When I think in terms of quality of life I immediately think in terms of success and what a successful life should look like; what I have, what I own, how free I am to play and travel. But over the years I have recognized that there have been times when, even having all these things, I was still unhappy. Why is that? How can that be? We've been trained by society to believe and be defined by a big house, nice car, great spouse, kids going to good schools, great vacations and good looks. All part of the vision we hold onto to find happiness, success and live our lives to the fullest. We work incessantly trying to reach these goals. I have had the great fort…

HOW YOU GET THEM IS HOW YOU KEEP THEM
July 22, 2017
I don’t usually dispense relationship advice, but I’m not only a Certified Life Coach but certified in Relationship Counseling. After having my own bumps in the road I began to study and assess my own mistakes. Someone has got to have the answer. Some do. If you’re in a healthy relationship and the work it takes to maintain your relationship seems easy thank GOD up above. It doesn’t always happen like that.
We all have our issues. Women seek men that give them stability and support. While men look for a woman that makes them feel good about themselves. Did she or does she make him a priority? There are some things that men and women both want.
1.Is this person affectionate? Do I feel loved and cared for with this person?
2.Do we share the same values? You don’t have to agree for your moral compass to be in sync.
3.Am I a priority? Everybody has family and other obligations, and responsibilities. Everyone can appreciate ambition. But would you allow your job to take priority over the perso…

comments
A top Taliban leader has threatened to begin operations attacking Pakistan. An ultimatum has been made that an offensive will open up from the strongholds in the Pashtun heartlands that will stretch throughout the country. The Taliban leader bragged that the Taliban network now reaches as far as the capital Islamabad.
They are angered that the agreement made in the armistice with local tribes, which they claim included them last year, has been broken by the Pakistan military operations in the frontier regions and retribution will not stop there. He boasted that the offensive would begin with Al Qaeda-style suicide bombings in the capital and spreading nationwide to a more general offensive against the Musharraf regime.

I've hit many potholes in my life, but none of those previous experiences could have prepared me for my most recent encounter. I was driving my usual route home from work, I would like to say I was minding my own business, but in truth, I was somewhat attending to my business, while vocally criticizing the business of those around me. I was in the right-hand lane of a two-lane road that was narrowing to one lane and there was one car ahead of me. This car was moving at an incredibly slow rate of speed, so he was going to have to be passed before the merge down to two lanes, which was coming up quickly. Employing my usual caution (none), I whipped into the left lane and sped past the offender, momentarily glimpsing the object of his speed reduction…BAM!<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />
This was not a pothole; this was a cauldron hole. Ants probably travel from all over the globe to stand at the rim in gape-mouthed wonder of its size and depth. To say it was jarring would be like saying electrocution is uncomfortable, if my car had been a fighter jet, lights would have been flashing, buzzers would have sounded and the altimeter would have wildly started spinning it's way to zero. After the initial impact, a torrent of profanities poured out of me like water from a hydrant. I swore long, loud and creatively, I'm pretty sure there was a point where Jesus and God themselves peered down from a cloud wondering what the hell a pothole was and why it needed to be damned to hell so vehemently. I eventually had to stop screaming to assess the damage…nothing…then, thudump, thudump, thudump. The profanities came again, pretty much the same lines as the first diatribe, but with "tire" replacing "pothole", I guess my creativity had been exhausted. Along with the interest of God and our Savior, because they obviously weren't going to be helping me out on this one.
I didn't want to actually change the tire. For one thing, it was fairly cold outside and it was snowing. For another, I was in <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" />South Chicago and am not an active member of the Latin Kings street gang. And last and most importantly, my mechanical aptitude falls somewhere between a three-year-old child and a mentally disabled orangutan. As luck would have it, there was a service station right where my tire went flat, as my of luck would have it, it had closed for business somewhere around 1984.
As I was bundling up to face the harsh winds and snow, I noticed a taxi sitting in the parking lot of the Supermercado just south of my tire changing location. He had turned on his headlights and his "TAXI" dome was also lit. I took this to mean that he doubted my tire changing capabilities and was signaling to me that there might be a better course of action. If this was a challenge, I was going to meet it head on, "sit in your warm taxi and watch how a real man handles a problem."
A smart person would take the time to get to know a vehicle after coming into its possession. But if there's one thing you can take away from this column every week, it's that I'll never have to suffer the recruiting efforts of Mensa or any other groups where intelligence is considered to be a prerequisite. I'd never really read this car's manual or even bothered to see what was in the trunk; the car is German, surely such an engineering-minded race of people have taken steps to make a simple tire change a snap. The trunk was orderly, I'll give them that, every tool had its little compartment. I located half the jack, but couldn't seem to find the other half that would actually make it stable. After searching the trunk and cursing the wind for 10 minutes, I noticed the jack had a diagram on it. The diagram seemed to suggest that this slight piece of metal was the jack, the whole jack and nothing but the jack, those savvy Germans had done it again!
To my astonishment, the jack actually seemed to be working, right up until the moment the tire left the ground. Then the car rolled forward and the jack collapsed sideways. My curses now fell squarely on the German people, no wonder they lost two world wars! Incompetence, mechanical incompetence! I then collected myself and assumed it was my placement of the jack that probably caused the problem, this time I angled it to compensate for eventual rolling of the vehicle. This accomplished one thing very well; it allowed me enough time to get the tire halfway off, so that the next collapse wedged the tire between the ground and the wheel well. I launched into the Germans again, and may also have kicked the jack a few times for good measure. Throughout this entire ordeal, the taxi remained where he was, like a damned lighthouse calling out to a lost ship at sea. Although, at this point I suspect his motives may have shifted; it was probably damn good entertainment from a distance.
I attempted the angling method about three more times with the same results, pausing to sit reflectively in the cold between attempts. After the third time, even the taxi driver gave up and left me, so I decided it was time to consult the manual. Yes, I had avoided doing so up to this point. As I leaned in to open the glove compartment I steadied myself on the emergency break handle, and that's when a German-accented voice called out to me, "Uz zee emergenzee brake, dumkoff!" Yes, I saw it now, the Germans had designed the jack for people who had common sense and the ability to consult a manual, what arrogance.
After discovering the magic brake, I was on my way in about 5 minutes. I was so happy to be finished that I apparently left the key to my locking lug nuts on the ground somewhere near the "crash site". So, now I'm navigating these war-torn streets with no ability to change a tire, which isn't too far from where I started, if you think about it.

Newcastle 1-0 Man Utd: 'Jose Mourinho was wrong, the Magpies did not get lucky'
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho was totally wrong when he said Newcastle played for a draw and relied on luck to beat his side on Sunday.
The only thing Mourinho was right about in his post-match interview was that the Magpies players worked incredibly hard for their victory.
Rafa Benitez's side thoroughly deserved their win because they defended better than Manchester United, they dominated midfield and they did what United could not do, which was score.
Yes, United created some chances and Newcastle's new goalkeeper Martin Dubravka had an incredible game on his debut.
But Mourinho relies on his goalkeeper David de Gea to get them a point sometimes - like at Anfield earlier this season, for example.
Mourinho would not tell you there was anything fluky about that result, and the same goes for the way the Magpies earned their win. They were everything but lucky, in fact.
From start to finish, it was a brilliant all-round team performance from Newcastle, and it would be unfair to just pick out one performance because there were so many that stood out.
In contrast, Manchester United showed why they are so far behind Premier League leaders Manchester City, as they struggled all over the pitch.
How Newcastle got their fans going from the start
Newcastle had slid into the bottom three before kick-off because of Huddersfield's win over Bournemouth earlier in the day.
Swansea had also moved above the Magpies in the table with their win over Burnley on Saturday, so it became hugely important that they got something out of the game, and their attitude was exactly what was required.
As well as picking up three much-needed points and climbing from 18th to 13th in the table, the way they did it should give them a huge boost of confidence, which is something they have been lacking at home and is one of the reasons they have been struggling there.
Newcastle are 13th in the table but are only two points above the relegation zone
The Newcastle fans definitely helped but the way the players went after Manchester United in the first 10 minutes lifted the whole stadium and got the crowd going from the start.
Benitez played with two up front in Dwight Gayle and Ayoze Perez, which was a really attacking approach anyway, and the high-tempo start the whole team made set the tone for the rest of the game.
We used to try to do something similar at St James' Park when I was a Newcastle player because we knew if we really took the game to the opposition early on then it created a really positive atmosphere from the start.
I understand why this Newcastle side has not been doing it at every home game, because Benitez knows the limitations of the squad he has got.
St James' Park is also a difficult environment to play in at the moment because of what is going on behind the scenes, with so many of the fans desperate for the owner Mike Ashley to leave.
But now the players have shown what they can do and they also know what kind of response they will get.
Newcastle are going to need to produce more home performances like this one in the next few months if they are going to stay up but, with the backing of that crowd, they have got a very good chance.
"You saw different players in the Newcastle shirt against Manchester United," Shearer said on MOTD2. "You saw them stand up and become bigger and better players because of the atmosphere. They have now got to do that against the so-called smaller clubs when the pressure is on them a little bit to try to attack."
The fans know what Benitez is going through
I don't think there has ever been any doubt that the Newcastle players have been giving their all for the shirt all season. The question has just been whether they have got enough ability to get out of trouble.
In the games I have seen, they have all worked extremely hard but one of the reasons they got the win on Sunday is that they also produced some quality when it mattered too.
"Diame and Shelvey were absolutely magnificent," Shearer said on MOTD2. "They combined so well together, covered every blade of grass and gave everything you want from midfielders - whether that was protection of the back four or sliding passes into the forwards. They worked their socks off for 90 minutes."
As well as Dubravka in goal, Jamaal Lascelles was magnificent, and Jonjo Shelvey and Mohamed Diame bossed midfield to the extent that United's big-hitters, Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic, were both taken off.
Newcastle had chances for more goals - De Gea made a world-class save to deny Shelvey - and they should have had a penalty when Chris Smalling fouled Gayle.
"Shelvey and Diame totally and utterly controlled the midfield against Matic and Pogba so that Mourinho took them both off," added Shearer. "They were driving and pulling Newcastle forward and feeding their forward players."
And, when Manchester United came back at them, they also defended brilliantly when they had to. One of the things Benitez has spoken about in the past is a lack of experience to see games out but they managed that on Sunday.
Benitez himself deserves huge credit for that, for the way he organised and motivated his team.
It has been a tough season for Newcastle but they have got the right man in charge, there is no doubt about that.
I think he is doing a magnificent job and the vast majority of fans are with him and know what he is going through, and having to put up with.
I was not surprised the club did not spend more money in the January transfer window because of what was going on in the background with the failed takeover, and I know Benitez wanted to strengthen his squad more than he did.
But two of the three signings he did make - Kenedy and Dubravka - have been excellent, and hopefully Islam Slimani will have the same impact in attack when he is fit.
Newcastle need goals to go with their spirit and resilience
Who will go down? Shearer says it will be West Brom, Stoke and Huddersfield or Crystal Palace
It has been obvious all season that Newcastle need more firepower and, although it worked against Manchester United, scoring one goal will not get them a win every week.
It was not enough against Burnley in their previous home game when Newcastle created lots of chances and missed a penalty, only to see their 1-0 lead pegged back in the final few minutes.
The reason they managed to hold on this time was down to their spirit and resilience, which are both positives, but they are going to need more goals to go with that too.
This was a brilliant win, but it remains incredibly tight at the bottom of the table and there is a lot more work to do.

Don’t Miss This Supersize View of Provincetown Bear Week from a Drone: WATCH
July 22, 2015 by Andy Towle Leave a Comment
David Cox is a maestro of drone videos, and he happens to live in Ptown. So when Provincetown Bear Week rolled around this year, he revved up his Yuneeq Q500 and went aloft to capture some spectacular aerial shots in and around the harbor, the Crown and Anchor, the Provincetown Inn pool (aka Bear Soup, above), and the Pilgrim Monument.
Everything else was captured with Cox’s iPhone 6.
Enjoy this beast of a video, below:
To see more of Cox’s drone videos and photos check out his new Facebook Page : Droning Provincetown.

No risk of World War III…not yet
Tweet
Published:
Tuesday, April 17, 2018
Alas, Babylon is a post-apocalyptic novel written by Pat Frank in 1959 about the aftermath of a nuclear war. It starts when an American fighter jet accidentally attacks a Soviet military base in Latakia, Syria. This plot, while plausible at the time of writing, was probably considered to be one of the least-likely triggers for World War III. But fast-forward sixty years later and the events taking place in today’s Syria begs the question of whether it could indeed become a flashpoint that results in a conflict of global proportions.
The Syrian Civil War is now entering its eighth year. Since its beginnings in March 2011, the fighting between rebel factions and government forces has resulted in over half a million dead and almost ten million refugees. Through the use of brutal tactics and support from powerful allies, the Assad regime has managed to hold on to power.
But the situation is far from stable. Many cities are in ruins. Parts of the country still remain under opposition control. And interference by foreign powers is now a normal occurrence. It’s a safe bet that the war is far from over. But the frightening part is that no one can say for certain what shape the next phase will take.
Following the recent chemical attack on the city of Douma, President Trump vowed to take military action to punish the regime. He even called out Russia for their continued backing of “Animal Assad”. In response, a spokesperson from the Russian foreign ministry warned that any incoming missiles would be shot down. President Trump, again resorting to provocative language, tweeted that Russia should “get ready” because they—the missiles—are coming, “…nice and new and smart.”
While this posturing was going on, both Britain and France signalled a willingness to join the Americans in whatever action they chose to take. And that’s exactly what happened on Friday night when allied aircraft and smart weapons struck multiple targets across Syria. At the time of writing the Russians have not retaliated, and there’s little reason to think that they will.
This back-and-forth was the first time since the Cold War ended that the US and Russia have been overtly antagonistic towards each other. Nevertheless, it would be premature to assume that both sides are on a path destined for war.
President Trump may have simply gotten ahead of himself, thinking that his bombastic rhetoric, which seemed to work with North Korea, would work here as well. But in doing so, he painted himself into a corner.
After criticising his predecessor’s failure to act on the infamous “red line” threat, Trump found himself caught between a rock and a hard place. He either had to fulfil his promise and hope the Russians weren’t in the mood for a confrontation, or back down, which would have not only eroded America’s reputation but embolden Assad to launch more chemical attacks in the future.
What did occur, however, was a third option—the targeting of Syrian military assets while avoiding the Russians; a “compromise” that was similar to last year’s attack on the Shayrat airbase. And that’s probably the end of it…because if the Russians were going to strike back they would have done so already, not that diplomatic farce of protesting before the Security Council.
This “tiptoeing around each other” allows both of them to save face. The Americans showed some backbone by following-through and the Russians were able to hold back using the excuse that they weren’t attacked directly.
Tragic as it may be, the Syrian Civil War is an internal matter. This is an important distinction because the US is once again imposing its will on a sovereign nation. The last time they did that was 15 years ago with the invasion of Iraq, the consequences of which are still being felt throughout the region. With that lesson in mind, neither they nor the Russians are going to risk starting World War III…not over the suffering of the Syrian people. They were dying before, what makes now any different?

Everyone we know was once a stranger, but how do those strangers become the people we love and care for? 'We All Start Out as Strangers' is a fifteen minute love story about two college age kids who are uncovering each others secrets and moving from strangers to friends.
Farm folk, who are amiable and simple yet cunning lived here on this Farm. From time to time strangers come to the Farm. And it is then that all hell always breaks loose. Because the strangers have also brought death with them. And destruction. And hate. And jealousy. And vanity. And shame. And lies. On this Farm strangers always just cause trouble...
Michael and Ava are two strangers who meet at a bar and a have a few too many drinks. The next morning neither has any recollection of each other or what happened the night before and with their location under police lock-down, these two strangers are trapped with each other. Michael and Ava are two strangers who meet at a bar and a have a few too many drinks. Waking up the next morning in bed

A portrait of Sarah and Michael from two strangers who know nothing about the other, to two strangers who know everything about each other. At once hilarious and heartbreaking this short film attempts to show just an ounce of the ambiguity, joy, and heartbreak of youthful love.
Seven strangers find themselves trapped inside an abandoned hospital after an unexplainable apocalyptic event. In addition to being haunted by what they've lost, the strangers must also fight off mysterious creatures that hunt them down one by one.
Strangers stumble across one another by chance. At first, nothing seemingly happens in each of these easily forgotten encounters, but everyone is affected without their knowing. 'Unknown' takes a closer look at these occurrences, which may unknowingly turn strangers into offenders or victims.
'Get into Bed with Me' is an experimental film inspired by a 7 day performance where the featured artist asked 7 strangers to get into bed with her. The sound composition has been composed from the interactions with those 7 strangers over 7 days. The film is completely unscripted.
A man's existence is put on trial when he finds himself inside a house with no exit. His whereabouts are as much a mystery as the identities of its inhabitants, and -- more importantly -- their motives. As his situation becomes elucidated, he finds the strangers may not be strangers after all.
A Homeless Man does everything he can to take care of the things that are most important in his life. In doing so, he crosses paths with several strangers, including a self-absorbed Businessman. Through the Homeless Man's actions, he changes the lives of these several strangers in a single moment.

The Latest on Tuesday's primary elections (all times local):
8:40 p.m.
Polls have closed across Pennsylvania, one of four states holding primary elections Tuesday.
In Pennsylvania, 84 candidates are vying for nominations in 18 U.S. House districts following the state's court-ordered redrawing of congressional maps. The new districts are expected to give Democrats their best shot in years of picking up seats long held by Republicans.
Republicans are also choosing their party's challengers to Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and to U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, setting the stage for what is expected to be a hotly contested general election two years after Pennsylvania helped deliver the White House to Donald Trump.
Idaho, Nebraska and Oregon are also holding primaries Tuesday.
___
12:10 a.m.
A redrawn congressional map in Pennsylvania just three months ago has left candidates scrambling as four states prepare to hold primaries.
In Pennsylvania, primary voters will decide the fate of President Donald Trump's pick for U.S. Senate. Idaho, Nebraska and Oregon are also holding primaries Tuesday.
Congressman Raul Labrador is one of three GOP candidates for governor in Idaho, a state so heavily Republican that the primary goes a long way to determining the general election.
Ten Republicans are vying for Oregon's gubernatorial nomination — the most in more than a century. The interest among candidates belies the uphill climb for the party in the Democratic-leaning state.
In Nebraska, Omaha-area Democrats will have options for the first time in the state's lone urban House district, where two liberals are running.

Possible congestion pricing plan for Los Angeles takes a step forward
January 23, 2019
A plan to bring congestion pricing to Los Angeles County has taken a tentative step forward, The Los Angeles Times reports. In an effort to reduce traffic while also raising funds for new mass transit projects, next month the board of directors for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) will take up an initiative to study the issue. The initiative, if approved, would allow the board to assemble a panel of experts to investigate how congestion pricing might work in Los Angeles County, where The Los Angeles Times reports nearly three-fourths of commuters drive to work. According to Metro, it could take up to two years to study possible congestion pricing plans. Metro’s consideration of congestion pricing comes as the transit authority gears up for its “28 by 28” initiative, a plan that seeks to bring over two dozen transformative transportation projects to fruition before the city hosts the 2028 Olympics. The 28 by 28 plan would build-out L.A.’s planned public transportation system as envisioned by the recent Measure M initiative. The 2016 measure raised county sales tax rates to partially fund system expansions to the tune of $860 million per year. That’s a sizable chunk of what’s needed to bring many projects to life, but ultimately not enough to have them completed before 2028, hence the need for additional funding. Metro is expected to tap federal and state funding sources—including California’s gas tax funds—to fill in funding gaps for projects that include a new transit route crossing the Sepulveda Pass, the completion of the Purple Line to Westwood, and a new transit line connecting Downtown Los Angeles with the southeastern suburb Artesia. Congestion pricing could help bridge the gap for the agency, however. According to The Los Angeles Times, a recent Metro report indicates that a per-mile tax on driving could raise $102 billion over ten years and that a fee to enter Downtown Los Angeles could bring in an additional $12 billion. Metro officials claim that congestion pricing could bring in enough new funding to lower base transit fares or even make the entire system free to ride. It’s possible that with the right congestion pricing plan, Metro could make transit more affordable and useful as it makes driving more expensive and difficult in tandem.
L.A. looks to rebrand its Metro lines using letters and colors
November 15, 2018
The Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) is moving to rename its new and existing rail and bus rapid transit lines. Metro staff this week recommended a new plan that aims to create a “clear, consistent, [and] uniform wayfinding system” for the transit authority and its 34 million annual riders. The proposed changes would replace the existing color-based nomenclature—Blue, Red, Purple, Gold, Orange, Silver—with letters and colors for the system’s major lines. If adopted as proposed, the transition to the new naming system could begin as early as 2019 when the Blue Line re-opens as the A Line after extensive renovations. In coming years, the so-called Regional Connector project currently being built to connect a pair of lines that dead-end into Downtown Los Angeles will come online, as well, reorganizing and consolidating the number of existing transit lines. Officials hope that the new naming system reduces confusion and makes traveling across the system smoother for local strap-hangers and tourists alike. The proposed policy is a result of extensive study and ridership polling that asked respondents to choose between different configurations of numbered, colored, and lettered options. Eventually, it was decided that a combination of approaches worked best and allowed for the most flexibility, considering that many of the forthcoming lines and extensions are still in the early planning stages and the ultimate configuration of the transit system is still unknown. The changes come as the city works to dramatically expand L.A.’s transit system before the 2028 summer Olympics. Before then, Metro aims to complete 28 major transit projects across the region, including the construction of several new lines and extensions, in addition to the Regional Connector project.
Construction begins on L.A.’s Purple Line extension as adjacent projects take shape
October 18, 2018
Over 30 years after it was initially planned, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) has started tunneling the final phases of the Purple Line subway. According to Metro, when completed in 2026, it will be possible to take a one-seat underground ride from Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles to Westwood—an area home to the University of California, Los Angeles campus, the Veterans Administration complex, and other major institutions—in roughly 25 minutes. For comparison, today the trip takes nearly an hour and a half by car or bus. Though its completion is many years away, the pending extension has begun to impact adjacent areas as rezoning efforts get underway in anticipation of the route. The pending Purple Line Transit Neighborhood Plan, for example, will modestly boost densities between the three adjacent stations surrounding the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) campus. As proposed, upper height limits in the densest areas could reach 70-feet, ten feet higher than currently allowed. The prospect of taller buildings on and around Wilshire Boulevard is not a far-off vision, however. The 18-story Vision on Wilshire project by Steinberg Hart and developers UDR, for example, wrapped up construction this summer. The pixelated tower comes with 150 units and joins other new apartment towers recently completed along the corridor. Nearby, a new glass-wrapped tower by MVE + Partners and developers J.H. Snider is slated for a site adjacent to the LACMA campus, and will bring 285 apartments and 250,000 square feet of offices just steps from the transit line. Another project on the boards is a two-tower condominium development slated to join the historic Minoru Yamasaki-designed Plaza Hotel in Century City. Here, Pei, Cobb, Freed & Partners, Gensler, Marmol Radzinger, and RCH Studios will add 290 luxury condominiums behind the historic hotel on a site that will host a new stop on the extension. The project is currently under construction. Not everyone is happy about the coming transit line, however, especially in Beverly Hills, which will see a new subway stop at Wilshire and Rodeo Drive. The City of Beverly Hills has been engaged in a years-long struggle to block the subway from running below its streets. Most recently, the Beverly Hills Unified School District orchestrated what it called a student “walk out” against the proposed metro line. The demonstration occurred last week and was aimed at trying to get the attention of President Trump, who is himself a Beverly Hills homeowner. According to The Los Angeles Times, students carried signs calling on the president to move the subway route, which is currently slated to run underneath Beverly Hills High School and other sites in the city, away from delicate areas. The students also sought to have the president take the unprecedented step of revoking the $1.5 billion in federal funds and low-cost loans awarded to the transformative project. There’s no word from the president yet, but Metro cranked up its two new tunneling machines Monday to begin digging the next leg of the extension nonetheless. It’s expected the tunneling machines will advance roughly 60 feet per day from La Brea Avenue and Wilshire toward the current Purple Line terminus at Western Avenue. After the tunnel there is excavated, the machines will be driven back to La Brea and begin the work of completing the final leg of the line. Phase one of the expansion is slated to open in 2023 with the second phase due to arrive in 2025 and final completion expected by 2026, just in time for the 2028 Olympic Games.
Boring Company unveils Hyperloop route for L.A.’s Dodger Stadium
August 17, 2018
The Boring Company has released yet another underground transit proposal for Los Angeles. Wednesday night, embattled Boring Company CEO Elon Musk announced the so-called Dugout Loop, a proposed “zero-emissions, high-speed, underground public transportation system” that could potentially ferry passengers between the Red Line subway and Dodgers Stadium. The company released a series of possible proposals, with variations on route length and station origination point. The ultimate aim of the proposal is to improve travel times between the East Hollywood, Los Feliz, and Rampart Village neighborhoods and the stadium, which is roughly 3.6-miles away. Boring Company estimates that the proposed loop would be able to complete a one-way trip in roughly four minutes and carry between 1,400 and 2,800 passengers per day, roughly the same number as are currently transported by the express Metro buses that currently operate between the stadium and Union Station using dedicated bus lanes. Here’s the hitch: Unlike conventional transportation systems that convey passengers in both directions simultaneously, Musk’s link would only be able to operate in one direction at a time. The limiting arrangement is a result of the small diameter tunnel that is being proposed for the route, similar to that of other Boring Company tunnels proposed for western Los Angeles and Chicago. The proposal comes after a week of questionable business decisions and erratic tweetstorms from Musk, and as L.A.’s Metro makes plans to embrace a proposed $125 million gondola system connecting the Union Station in Downtown L.A. with the stadium. Backers for the gondola plan include former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt; Estimates for the transit link indicate the gondolas could ferry as many as 5,000 passengers per hour, with traffic moving in both directions simultaneously. Musk recently drew criticism and accusations of project “segmenting” for bypassing environmental review as the Boring Company attempts to move forward with a portion of a proposed Hyperloop route through L.A.’s Westside neighborhoods. Neighborhood groups outraged by the effort successfully sued to block the project. The proposal also comes as the Boring Company faces legal challenges for a similarly-vague proposal issued for Chicago that would link the city with O’Hare Airport.
Los Angeles to deploy body scanners on its subways
August 15, 2018
Los Angeles County’s transit system is poised to become the first in the country to deploy airport-style security measures to screen its passengers. The Los Angeles Times reports that the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) is rolling out new portable body scanners that can be deployed in response to terrorist threats and during large crowd events like protests and sporting matches in an effort to thwart potential “mass casualty” attacks. The scanners can be used to screen passengers using radio waves from up to 30 feet away and are designed with an integrated split-screen display that produces a black square over the part of a person’s body where a gun or non-metallic explosive device might be located. Metro currently operates 93 subway and light-rail stations—with many more on the way—and has plans to utilize the mobile devices as necessary across its system. Officials at Metro explained that areas where passengers might be subject to body scanning will be clearly labeled in each station with signs that read: “Passengers proceeding past this point are subject to Metro security screening and inspection.” Plans call for making “randomized” scans of passengers traveling within these zones. Officials at a press conference announcing the plan explained, however, that passengers seeking to opt out of the possibility of being scanned will not be allowed to ride transit from that station. The scanners can process roughly 2,000 passengers per hour, according to Dave Sotero, spokesperson for Metro. The figure is an improvement over previous technologies, The Times reports, but likely to fall short of what would be required to process crowds efficiently during rush hour or large scale events. Recent protests in Downtown Los Angeles, for example, have drawn hundreds of thousands of people at a time and have snarled Metro service even without the scanners in place.
An automated people mover could come to L.A.’s new football stadium
July 23, 2018
The City of Inglewood in Southern California has announced a plan to add a 1.8-mile automated people mover (APM) connecting the forthcoming Los Angeles Rams stadium and the region’s growing transit network in the near future. A recently-unveiled scoping study called Envision Inglewood calls for establishing a “direct connection to rail” between downtown Inglewood and the city’s impressive slate of professional sports and performance venues. Facilities that could be connected by the new transit route include: The Forum, the forthcoming Los Angeles Stadium and Entertainment District at Hollywood Park, and the recently-unveiled Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center, a potential new basketball stadium for the Los Angeles Clippers NBA team. The new $2.66 billion Rams stadium is designed by HKS Architects and will be joined by a 3,000-unit mixed-use residential development next door known as “City of Champions.” The Forum was designed by Charles Luckman Associates in 1966 in the late modern style; The complex is slated to host the gymnastic events for the 2028 Olympic Games. The Envision Inglewood plan was crafted in conjunction with a series of other transportation and pedestrian fixes. The plan considers four different alignments and a handful of transport modes in its aim to provide a “world-class transit connection to-and-from the Metro Crenshaw/LAX Line” transit route, an 8.5 mile light rail line connecting the cities of Los Angeles, Inglewood, and El Segundo through southern Los Angeles County slated to open in 2019. According to a presentation made at the Inglewood City Council, the report’s chosen route—dubbed the “Market-Manchester” alignment—would add the APM link starting from the forthcoming Downtown Inglewood stop on the Crenshaw Line. The elevated train would snake down Market Street and Manchester Boulevard, ultimately ending up on South Prairie street where it can conveniently stop at the three stadium and performance venue locations. Renderings for the proposed plan depict lively street scenes overlooked by elevated train tracks on concrete piers. Projections for the line envision up to 2,578,120 potential boardings across the APM route per year, with slightly less than 40% of all boardings related to “event ridership.” According to the report, the link could cost $614.4 million to build and between $18.2 million and $19.5 million to operate each year. A timeline for the project’s completion has not been announced. The new football stadium is scheduled to open for the 2019-2020 NFL season.
L.A. is one step closer to bringing light rail to the San Fernando Valley
June 19, 2018
Although the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles is home to nearly two million people, aside from two subway stops and a bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor, the enclave maintains relatively few robust regional public transit connections. That situation is likely to change over the coming decade if a plan to build a 9.2-mile light rail transit line is implemented as recommended by a recent Los Angeles County Metro staff report. Staffers call for Metro to build the so-called Alternative 4 plan, a scheme that would stitch the Sylmar/San Fernando Metrolink Station in the northeast corner of the valley together with the Metro Orange Line BRT route on the valley’s southern edge. The L-shaped route would run on a 2.5-mile segment within the Metro-owned railroad right-of-way adjacent to San Fernando Road along its northern stretch with the remainder of the route running at-grade in the street median along Van Nuys Boulevard. Although perhaps best known as a 1950s-era cruising spot, Van Nuys Boulevard is now home to the second-busiest busway in the valley and also clocks in as the seventh busiest bus route system-wide. The planned light rail route would shave 30 minutes off the current travel times, with trains passing every six minutes during peak intervals. With a bit of luck, the proposed route also has the potential to definitively link the valley with the rest of Los Angeles, depending on which alignment is chosen for other forthcoming high-profile project routes. Metro is in the planning stages for the Sepulveda Pass transit project, a scheme that would bridge the mountain pass currently traversed by Interstate-405 in order to connect the valley to L.A.’s Westside neighborhoods and to Los Angeles International Airport. Metro is investigating a smattering of transit schemes for the route including heavy rail subway, light rail, and even a monorail, among other options. If the agency goes with the light rail alternative, it’s possible a one-seat ride from San Fernando to LAX might one day be a possibility. Several of the other alternatives under consideration for the line could still create the regional link, albeit with a transfer from the Van Nuys line to the Sepulveda Pass route. If a direct connection to the Sepulveda Pass is unavailable, the Van Nuys line also has the potential of becoming a spur off of the Orange Line—the existing BRT route in the valley—which Metro is considering converting to light rail sometime in the future. Metro has not explicitly stated this potential alignment as a possibility, but if the agency decides to pursue heavy rail or a monorail through the Sepulveda Pass, it would be an easy way to connect the route to the existing and planned transit system. Metro is also currently eyeing extending the Orange Line east through Burbank, Glendale, and Pasadena, though only as a BRT project as of now. The agency is also considering a complimentary east-west BRT line through the valley along Nordhoff Street. The recommended proposal for the Van Nuys line has the potential to remake the valley, either way, as the areas surrounding the potential route are already densifying and lots of development is slated for adjacent neighborhoods. The Metro Board of Supervisors will take up the light rail recommendation on June 27th; The agency expects to begin construction on the route during fiscal year 2020-2021 with final completion due by 2027, just in time for the 2028 olympic games.
L.A. Metro unveils plans to link San Fernando Valley with Westwood and eventually LAX
June 12, 2018
The Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) has unveiled six potential alignments for a forthcoming transit project that could link L.A.’s San Fernando Valley with the city’s Westside neighborhoods and—eventually—with Los Angeles International airport (LAX). The concepts were unveiled last week and represent the latest efforts to span over the Sepulveda Pass with public transit, an effort that is complicated by the route’s steep terrain, the presence of the Santa Monica Mountains, and the presence of Interstate-405, the busiest and most congested freeway in the United States. Plans call for building the link in two phases, with an initial segment connecting the Westwood with the southernmost edge of the valley due to be completed by 2026. A southern extension to LAX could be completed by 2057 under the current timetable. For that initial segment, the six proposed alignments are as follows: Concept 1: Planners envision a 10-mile underground subway alignment that would link the future terminus of the regional Purple Line subway with the Orange Line busway in the valley neighborhood of Sherman Oaks, where the line could link with a forthcoming north-south transit route planned for Van Nuys Boulevard. To the south, the new heavy rail transit line (HRT) would also link with the east-west Expo Line that connects Downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica. Concept 2: A second potential HRT line would follow a similar tunneling route but would connect with the Orange Line station on Sepulveda Boulevard instead of Van Nuys. The potential alignment could contain as many as five miles’ worth of aerial alignments constructed to link separately with the forthcoming Van Nuys Line, as well. This route would run a total of 13 miles in length and could connect to the Expo similarly to Concept 1. Concept 3: This alignment would follow the same path as Concept 1 but would be built using light rail transit (LRT) technology, a cheaper option that would ultimately carry fewer passengers per train at slower speeds than the HRT proposal. The underground route would ultimately run about 10 miles in length. Concept 4: This route would run along the same alignment as Concept 3, but would feature a mile-long aerial spur that would link to the Orange Line. Plans are currently underway to convert the Orange Line from a bus rapid transit route (BRT) to a light rail line, meaning that, with this option, the two routes could potentially share trains in the future, creating the possibility of several different one-seat routes. Concept 5: Metro is also considering monorail and rubber tire trams for the Sepulveda Pass route, options that would blend below-ground, at-grade, and aerial alignments to cross through the mountain range. Concept 5 would follow the same route as Concept 1 but would result in a transit line that simply linked the two regions without offering the interlining capabilities of Concept 4 or the capacity and speed of Concepts 1 and 2. Concept 6: Concept 6 is proposed as an extension of the Purple Line route, an idea that would thread the primarily east-west line northward into the valley, where it could link with other forthcoming lines or even extend further in their stead. The potential alignment would be the death knell for the “Subway to the Sea” concept originally proposed for the Purple Line that would have extended the line to Santa Monica. That idea has been on the back burner for years as Metro has moved ahead with planned extensions that take the route only as far west as Westwood, where the line simple dead-ends. Metro will be gauging public opinion on the routes over coming weeks and will announce a consolidated list of route options at a later date. The route is listed as one of the 28 transit projects Metro would like to complete before L.A. hosts the 2028 Olympics, so the timeline for the project will likely be sped up over the coming years.
L.A. breaks ground on next leg of Purple Line subway extension
February 27, 2018
Officials in Los Angeles broke ground late last week on the second leg of a long-planned 9.1-mile extension of the city’s Purple Line subway. The so-called Section 2 extension will bring an additional 2.59 miles of underground track and two new stations to the line in addition to the 3.92 miles currently under construction for Section 1 of the extension, The Source reports. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) began construction on the Section 1 extension in 2015 and is currently 30 percent done with work on that leg. Work on Section 1 is expected to be completed by 2023, with Section 2 wrapping up in 2025, and a planned Section 3 completed the following year. Metro is aiming to finish the entire 9.2-mile extension before the year 2028, when Los Angeles is due to host the Summer Olympics. Section 1 of the extension will thread the heavy rail line to the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and La Cienega, just west of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art campus. Sections 2 and 3 will bring the line to Century City and the Veterans Administration campus in Westwood, respectively. Metro recently awarded a $1.37-billion construction contract to joint venture contractor Tutor Perini O&G to build the Section 2 subway; Another joint venture contractor—Skanska-Traylor-Shea—is building Section 1. Work on the line has already begun to impact the areas around the extension, with many new high-rise projects currently in the pipeline for sites immediately surrounding Wilshire Boulevard. The expansion has also spurred new construction of luxury-oriented housing adjacent to existing stops, as well. During a public presentation earlier this month, Metro officials detailed construction activity for the extensions, providing an update on utility relocation work, detailing which street tree specimens would need to be removed—and replaced—to facilitate construction, and also debuted preliminary renderings for the above-ground elements of several new transit stations. Renderings for these new stations depict glass canopy-topped subway entrances surrounded by hardscaped plaza spaces. Next, Tutor Perini O&G and several utility companies will work on reorganizing the maze of pipes and conduit below city streets for Section 2 areas, while work on a staging site that will be used to begin drilling the subway tunnel takes place. Work on the Section 1 extension will continue as planned.
L.A. mayor to announce 28 transit projects for completion before 2028 Olympics
November 28, 2017
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is preparing to announce a final slate of projects for his "28 by 28" initiative before the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s (Metro) board of directors this week. Garcetti’s effort aims to complete 28 regional transit projects before Los Angeles hosts the summer Olympics in 2028. The proposal includes a collection of projects already planned under a recently passed transportation funding ballot initiative called Measure M, urbanize.LA reports. Measure M is slated to bring $860 million per year to regional transit projects that Metro will utilize to diversify regional transportation options. According to a plan posted to the Metro website, Garcetti’s initiative includes 16 projects planned under Measure M and a previous transit measure. These projects include light rail and bus rapid transit (BRT) expansions across the region, as well as several highway improvement and widening efforts. The plan calls for expanding six light rail lines, which includes the completion of new light rail lines to Crenshaw in South Los Angeles, Van Nuys in the San Fernando Valley, and Santa Ana in the southeast. Also included are a slew of regional BRT projects in the northern San Fernando Valley along Vermont Avenue and through Glendale. The collected projects have the potential to reshape the region’s urban geography, as evidenced by the explosion of transit-oriented development proposed along the recently extended Expo light rail line in West Los Angeles. The areas around the first phase of the Purple Line subway extension are already booming with high-density, mixed-use developments. Further information on the 28 by 28 plan is forthcoming. See the Metro website for the official Measure M transit expansion roll-out schedule.
Los Angeles seeks public-private partnerships to build mass transit faster
October 3, 2017
Officials with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) have begun to explore the potential opportunities public-private partnerships (P3) might afford the entity as it seeks to fast-track the construction of several key transit expansions across the Los Angeles region. Specifically, The Source reported that Metro is currently working to develop a timeframe for expediting the delivery of three projects: The construction of a new north-south transit tunnel running through the Santa Monica Mountains underneath the Sepulveda Pass; the addition of the new southeasterly West Santa Ana transit line to the city of Artesia; and the county-wide expansion of the existing Express Lanes toll lane system. The projects represent lynchpin expansions for the 26-year-old transit system that will result from the passage of 2016’s Measure M, a regional half-cent tax increase that is expected to raise $860 million in new transit-oriented revenue each year in perpetuity. Measure M is expected to rework the region’s approach to mobility by expanding Metro’s rail network by more than a factor of two, while also funding street, bicycle, and highway improvements, as well. Metro received several unsolicited proposals for the projects in question earlier this year. The proposals, aimed at improving delivery times and reducing construction costs for the projects, are the result a new effort on the part of the transit agency to draw industry knowledge and experience to its project planning operations under the tenure of Chief Innovation Officer Joshua Schank. In a statement, Schank said, “We are seeing innovation at its best and we look forward to delivering projects and programs—supported by P3s—to improve the quality of life in our region sooner rather than later.” Metro has utilized the unsolicited proposals to begin crafting RFPs for each of the projects. The logic behind the move is that P3s can speed construction and improve coordination between the agency, designers, and contractors, allowing for faster delivery of the projects in question and also—due to cost savings—potentially lead to expedited delivery for other projects, as well. Parsons Transportation Group and Cintra US Services submitted unsolicited bids for the Sepulveda Transit Corridor project, the transit portion of which will now be developed via the RFP process as a P3 project. Once completed, the 20-mile-long, $9.4 billion corridor is expected to serve over 100,000 daily transit riders. Parsons completed work on the final leg of Metro's Expo Line extension late last year. Metro received two proposals for the West Santa Ana Branch Transit Corridor from Skanska and Kiewit, which will also result in an RFP for a P3 project that will utilize elements from each firm’s unsolicited bid. The 20-mile long route would be built in two phases for between $3 billion and $4.5 billion and carry 75,000 riders daily. Lastly, Goldman Sachs submitted a proposal for the regional expansion Metro’s ExpressLanes network. Metro will pursue a procurement bond in order to underwrite the implementation of the new regional toll road network. Details, as well a timeline for the RFP process, are set to be released in the coming months.
Fly through L.A.’s massively upgraded Union Station in this new video
July 21, 2017
The Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) has released a new promotional video showcasing preliminary designs for a collection of dramatic upgrades slated for the city’s Union Station railway and transit terminal in Downtown Los Angeles. The fly-through video features conceptual designs for the improvements and demonstrates that designers for the project are thinking big as they aim to rework the historic Los Angeles Union Station building. According to the video, a new circular, airport terminal–like elevated concourse will wrap between train platforms on the far eastern end of the complex, with the station’s many public transit connections scattered throughout the station’s western extents. The scheme calls for sandwiching an ADA-accessible vertical circulation core between the new structure and the existing station functions. The above-grade concourse will also feature retail spaces, wayfinding signage, and treetop views of the city, all looping around multiple train concourse platforms that will eventually include a depot for California’s forthcoming high-speed rail network. The new concourse is part of the ongoing LINK Union Station project that aims to add through service to the regional transit hub. Currently, several regional transit lines dead end at the station, an arrangement that will change once the improvements are made, allowing for faster travel times through the area, a reduction in necessary transfers between regional commuter rail lines, and expanded access and visibility for the hub. Metro has not secured funding for the project, which according to certain estimates, could cost between $1.7 and $2.1 billion. The scheme will be in the running against a more expensive ground floor concourse concept that is still currently under development. For more information, see the Metro website.

ONE COLUMNIST’S VIEW: INSIDE THE ‘MIND’ OF DONALD J. TRUMP
Posted by Asia Media Staff | Jan 3, 2018 | China, Hong Kong, Tom Plate | 0 |
TOM PLATE WRITES – Recent U.S. presidents, at least in public, would speak of China only after the vetting of practically every word, as if an errant one might prove seriously chancy. The bilateral was too complex, the stakes too high, the relationship freighted with too many tensions to have it otherwise – to speak off-the-cuff, to use excessive verbiage, to wax macho or nacho … irresponsible and possibly disrespectful. President Donald J. Trump is different and in the back-and-forth between China and the U.S., this lays on more uncertainty to the bilateral relationship.
It’s as if the entire world – one hypothesis making the rounds has it — exists within the confines of his own mind, so that when that mind is turned off, as it were, it might be said that the world sort of ceases to exist. Absurd as that may seem, there is ample precedent for this view in classical philosophy. Bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753) defined reality (the ‘stuff’ out there…) as nothing more than a product of, and dependent on, the human mind – for what can really be said to exist outside of the mind? Here in the quaint words of this landmark Irish philosopher: “All the choir of heaven and furniture of earth – in a word, all those bodies which compose the frame of the world – have not any subsistence without a mind.” The self-regarding mind of Mr Trump could be said to mirror this. Last week a New York Times reporter caught our U.S. president in a Berkeleian mindset, as it were. The interview covered tout le monde even though its duration was but a half hour.
Zhongnanhai carefully noted that the ‘reality show’ inside the president’s mind did not exclude China, nor its president, Xi Jinping. Said Trump from the Grille Room of his Mar-a-Lago hotel: “Yeah, China. …. I like very much President Xi. He treated me better than anybody’s ever been treated in the history of China .… One of the great two days of anybody’s life and memory having to do with China. He’s a friend of mine, he likes me, I like him, we have a great chemistry together. [But] China’s hurting us very badly on trade, but I have been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war. O.K.? …. I’m disappointed. You know that they found oil going into [North Korea] … Oil is going into North Korea. That wasn’t my deal! … My deal was that … they’re a nuclear menace, so we have to be very tough… If they’re helping me with North Korea, I can look at trade a little bit differently, at least for a period of time…. China has a tremendous power over North Korea. Far greater than anyone knows.”
That has been Mr Trump’s persistent view; but as persistently Beijing has warned the world that its leverage over the southeast-border neighbor is easy to overestimate (Americans who dismiss this PRC assertion out of hand might reflect on our own limited leverage over southern neighbor Mexico – maybe Beijing doesn’t want to have to build a wall someday?). For its part, the Hong Kong government, of the very special administrative region of China, said it is taking serious note of allegations of Hong Kong-based tankers involved in midnight oil-to-Pyongyang subterfuge. In matters of this gravity, the foreign ministry in Beijing responded by calling for “calm” – a boilerplate response of late that makes one wonder if MOFA-Beijing has anyone (or two) in mind. North Korea, after all, is a nuclear power, its leader a bombastic Brexit-style bully.
The China on Trump’s mind: Over the centuries western philosophy made a virtual profession of toney quarrels about the so-called mind-body problem. But not all philosophers were reverent: Gilbert Ryle would scoff at the very idea of an independent mind ‘thing’ – derided in his memorable phrase: “the myth of the ghost in the machine.” Of course, this strong-minded English philosopher (1900-1976) had not encountered our current president; if he had, the experience might have made him believe in ghosts. With respect to Ryle, we mere intellectual mortals routinely conjure about our leaders only because of what we suspect their minds might contain.
An American novelist once asserted that the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. Unexamined is the question of how to rate an intelligence that may lack the ability to hold just one unopposed coherent idea. On the evidence available, the mind of our American president, who is to mark his first full year in office soon, tends toward the blunt-binary – ‘they’ are either for us or against us; ‘they’ are either cooperative (as we define it) or are rudely non-compliant.
You may have noticed this kind of mind soaks in self-congratulation (“…better than anybody’s ever been treated in the history of China”) – almost bathing in a buoyant mentality that talks only to itself, as if to minimize contradiction or interruption. With that to work with, intelligence-service agencies assigned to psyche-profiling of leaders now have their hands full, if not their minds blown. After all, Trump’s predecessor proved much the easier psychology to scope out: always valuing the rational, rarely preferring melodramatic action, almost even predictable (perhaps to a fault) – a mind shaped more by the mechanisms of law-school analytics than the showmanship of the pitches of the American salesman. Mr Donald J. Trump is the opposite of former President Barack H. Obama. In terms of the back-and-forth between China and the U.S., this is a difference that will add a new layer of uncertainty to the world’s most pivotal bilateral relationship. We should keep this in mind.

Our Mission
A continuously appearing, student-driven publication of Loyola Marymount University’s Asia Media International Center, which is a part of LMU’s Department of Asian and Asian American Studies (AAAS), the new AMI retains the former ASIA MEDIA’s scholarly aim while incorporating a contemporary outlook and format. The integration of innovative concepts to the new website serves to re-emphasize its mission: the examination of Asian countries by undergraduate students. This is Asia’s century. As the world’s center of political gravity is inevitably shifting to the East, this site seeks to place its spotlight on Asia as a method of focusing on trends within its society and politics. The mission of the new ASIA MEDIA also aims to help deepen LMU’s overall institutional understanding of – and relationship with – Asia.

Sahuarita students receive book donation from veterans groups
August 19, 2014 |
Amber Woods/Sahuarita Unified School District
A A A
Breaking down barriers and establishing community ties to provide students with authentic rich learning experiences is one goal of the new courses offered at Walden Grove High School.
Last year the high school in Sahuarita Unified School District began offering a new option for English IV to seniors. The response was so overwhelming that they are offering two new sections in English this year for sophomores and juniors.
The new English III class, offered to juniors, focuses on literature about America’s military conflicts.
Krista and Jeremy Gypton approached the Green Valley Military Officers Association of America and American Legion Post 109 to ask for involvement with the class.
The members of these groups saw an opportunity to make a difference and decided to help out. They purchased 240 books for the class and offered to commit to being part of a year-long biography project.
Lt. Colonel John McGee USMC, Major Steve Abel USAF, and Vice Mayor for Town of Sahuarita Bill Bracco delivered the books to the students on Tuesday, August 12, 2014.
“I think that anytime that we can break down the walls between the community and our classrooms it’s a good thing,” said teacher Krista Gypton. “I love that the organizations were willing to invest in our students. The more real connections, real audiences, and real conversations we provide the kids to see that education matters beyond a test score, we all win.”

Katie Farrell knows what it’s like to struggle with weight issues. Unhealthy and destructive eating habits plagued her for years, until she discovered how to care for herself in accordance with God’s will. In Nourish, she explains how she was able to make peace with her body and learn to live a healthy lifestyle.
Farrell shares the types of foods she enjoys along with those she tries to avoid. This may not be the same eating plan the reader follows, but can easily be adapted if necessary, since she doesn’t dwell on specifics. Some healthy recipes are provided, and the author’s website has more available. Exercise is also encouraged, but again, no specific plan is promoted. Instead, she encourages the reader to discover for herself exactly how God wants her to care for her body.
God’s word can be trusted to instruct us, and Farrell provides Biblical references she has used in developing her own self-care plan. If you’re looking for a diet and exercise checklist to follow, this is not the book for you. But if you’re looking for a spiritual mentor to lead you to God’s will for your life, Farrel is a wonderful guide. I highly recommend Nourish and the Dashing Dish website.

Sandy’s Punch Proves Truth Will Out
Celia Wexler, sr. Washington rep., Center for Science & Democracy | November 8, 2012, 3:55 pm EDT
Sometimes it’s really difficult to accept that we’re still evolving. In the far distant past, our ancient ancestors could look about them and observe the planets and the stars and the tides. They would experience flood and drought and watch for signs of impending disasters. They might believe that the disasters were caused by angry gods, and their strategies for avoiding calamity may have been limited by their belief systems. Nevertheless, they were guided at least, in part, by what their eyes and senses told them, and relied on their powers of observation to predict what would happen.
This post is part of a series on Hurricane Sandy: Confronting the Realities of Climate Change.
Thankfully, as the world has grown more complex, we’ve developed scientific tools to help us precisely observe changes in our environment and project what those changes may look like in the future.
In many parts of the country, elected officials are happy to make decisions grounded in science.
For example, some communities realize the threat of rising sea levels and are slowly taking the necessary steps to adapt and protect their communities. Take south Florida. Sea levels rose 8-9 inches over the last 100 years. If Sandy had hit Florida, dozens of cities would have flooded.

Four counties — Miami-Dade, Broward, Monroe, and Palm Beach — formed the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact in 2009 to help mitigate and adapt to the consequences of climate change. In early October the four-county compact released its Regional Climate Action Plan (RCAP), to address the consequences of rising sea levels, among other issues.
In other parts of the country, some elected officials seem bent on limiting what their eyes can see and their minds may be able to measure.
Last year the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality censored a scientific study on sea level in Galveston Bay — based on years of peer-reviewed research — that concluded that levels were rising much faster than in the past. Somehow, just acknowledging that change became politically controversial, as if not noticing rising sea levels would make them go away. It was only after outrage from academics and scolding from many of the state’s editorial writers that the Commission backed off and let the passages about sea level rise and climate change linked to human activities remain in the final version of the report.
The red areas are the most vulnerable parts of North Carolina due to the estimated sea level rise. Photo: USFWS
In North Carolina, as my colleague Michael Halpern wrote last summer, some legislators seemed to believe that if you pass a law that bans the gathering of information, the laws themselves will alter the reality. Don’t utter the words ‘sea level rise” and bingo! – The coasts are intact and protected.
The North Carolina legislature considered passing a law that would have required its Coastal Resources Commission to consider only historic data, and excluded any new evidence of rapidly rising sea levels, when regulating coastal development. The legislature ended up approving a weaker version of the bill that still delays any action to address science-based sea level evaluations for at least four years. Actually, the legislation was driven not by a naïve belief in the power of words, but a money-driven conviction that any hint that sea levels were going higher would discourage development, and thus cause a reduction in the level of real estate developers’ incomes.
Ironically, the North Carolina State House sits just a few blocks from a world-class natural history museum that lays out the stark realities of rising sea levels for the state.
My home state, Virginia, is not immune from this behavior. State delegate Chris Stolle of Virginia Beach referred to “sea level rise” as a “left-wing term.” But he was okay with a study that looked at “recurrent flooding.”
When elected officials fail to face the facts and deny the science underlying that reality, they delay, and perhaps permanently block, the best means to help their communities cope with future weather events and other natural disasters.
These examples would be funny if all they did was provide grist for late-night comedy shows. But here’s the problem: Softening the language or changing the words we use can often obscure what the problem actually is.
One would hope that the dramatic impact of Hurricane Sandy might help these information censors see the folly of their ways. Whether you accept it or not, a mass of water will make you wet and likely will do something pretty drastic to your coastlines.
It’s hard enough changing the way we think about floods without the distraction of these word games. Even the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as stellar as it was in responding to Hurricane Sandy, is falling down on the job when it comes to preparing for future severe weather. As Juliet Eilperin reported recently in The Washington Post, FEMA continues to use only historic data when planning for future floods. Floods are coming more frequently, and doing more damage. FEMA’s maps must be revised to account for human-caused climate change.
Yes, the word is climate change. You might be able to kick it out of the political lexicon, but that won’t stop its terrible toll.
President Barack Obama and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie witnessed the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy first-hand. We need to ask all of our elected officials to look at the science and make responsible policy decisions to prepare for the changing climate. Photo: White House
And there has been a toll. People who survived Hurricane Sandy are suffering. New Jersey’s coastal communities were not wiped out by a “left-wing term” but by a very real and angry sea that was higher than it used to be because of climate change. Not only did they lose their homes, but in some cases, they face a long-term loss of infrastructure. The water smashed bridges, downed power lines, and seeped into natural gas pipelines, causing months-long displacement for thousands of people.
This is something the rest of the country can see with its own eyes. We can only hope that the havoc raised by Hurricane Sandy changes minds and helps everyone understand that facts are not political, nor are they the enemy. When it comes to predicting and preparing for the future, facts can be, in the truest sense of the word, our best and most powerful friends.

The science I am seeing in these blogs is true and disturbing. The wrong-headed thinking of those who deny the existence of climate change and the dangers it poses is far more frightening. Having just watched Ken Burns’s film about the Dust Bowl years, I fear that we are headed that way again, but on a far grander scale. We must work on what we can do to get the truth out there where it can be obvious to “the meanest intelligence,” and even to the most short-sighted, self-interested, and greedy. I wish us luck.

Sultry Labor Day weekend !
Labor Day weekend will serve up plenty of heat and humidity, but only small helpings of rain through Monday. Temperatures will only drop into the lower 70's on Saturday morning and then scoot right back up toward the 90's by the afternoon:
The heat index will make it especially hot during the afternoon on Saturday:
Sunday may bring even higher heat index temps.
Only isolated to widely scattered storms possible on Saturday afternoon:
Additional scattered storms will appear on Sunday afternoon and evening, too.

Friday Night Football; Weekend Storms
Most of the Friday morning showers will stay to our southwest. A few showers possible in Carmi & Fairfield.
A warm front will move in on Friday, causing our temps to remain near 90-degrees…which is slightly above normal. A few scattered thunderstorms possible but with a low severe weather threat. Dry for most area football games but a brief shower is possible in the first half.
Summer weather still going strong at the start of meteorological fall. Saturday through Labor Day will feature partly sunny skies with mainly scattered afternoon thunderstorms. High temps will remain in the upper 80's to 92.

August driest month yet this year.
After a very wet winter and spring, Mother Nature has turned the spigot off for the late summer in the Tri-State. Rainfall has dipped enough below normal that the U.S. Drought monitor now classifies parts of the Tri-State as abnormally dry. Not quite a drought, but much less rain than we would expect for this time of the year.
In August, most of the Tri-State only scratched out a measly .95" of rainfall, almost 2" below the normal. The dry conditions, combined with heat have put stress on your lawn and garden...especially if you don't water them.
Only a handful of days have brought rain, and even those days did not produce a significant rainfall:
This is certainly a contrast to the first half of the year. February was the wettest in over 100 years, and March & April delivered surplus rainfall as well:
May and June looked promising, but since July our fortunes have switched. Most of July was bone-dry until the blockbuster 2.35" rainfall on the last day of the month.
The Climate Prediction Center hints at near-normal rainfall in the coming 10 days, but September and October tend to be the driest months in the Tri-State. Keep your fingers crossed and keep the hose & sprinkler going !

Presidential Forecast; Weekend Storm Chances
A few scattered showers...mainly during the morning. Dry weather through President Trump's visit with light winds from the northeast.
High temps in the mid-90's disappeared behind a cold front. Mostly cloudy and not as hot with high temps only in the lower 80’s.
Saturday through Labor Day will feature partly sunny skies with mainly scattered afternoon thunderstorms. High temps will remain in the upper 80’s. The normal high temp is 87-degrees.

Rain possible today, nicer weather Thursday
After multiple days of sunshine and temperatures in the 90s, rain and cooler weather has returned to the Tri-State.
Our severe weather threat has been downgraded, and it looks like we will probably just be dealing with run-of-the-mill scattered showers and thunderstorms this afternoon and evening.
Overnight, temperatures will fall into the upper 60s to low 70s. The rain will start to taper off tonight, but there is still a slight chance of rain on into Thursday morning.
Aside from a few morning showers, Thursday looks mostly dry. However, the clouds will still hang around throughout the day, and cooler air will continue to filter into the Tri-State from the north. Temperatures will top out in the lower 80s Thursday afternoon under mostly cloudy skies.
A warm front will make its way toward the Tri-State Friday, causing our temperatures to rise into the upper 80s and bringing isolated rain chances back into the forecast as we head into Labor Day weekend.

On Alert For Strong Thunderstorms
Heat break on the way.
Rain chances return today as a cold front slides south from the Great Lakes easing temps in the upper 80’s. There is a Marginal Risk for severe thunderstorms. The primary storm threats include damaging winds, lightning, and torrential rainfall.
The best chances for showers and storms set-up Wednesday afternoon through 9:00 p.m.
On Thursday, cooler with high temps in the lower 80’s. Temps slightly above normal Labor Day weekend under partly sunny skies. High temps in the upper 80’s with scattered showers and storms during the afternoon. However, dry weather on Labor Day.

On Alert for storms Wednesday
We remain on Alert for the possibility of a few severe storms Wednesday, and the cold front bringing those storms will also bring us a brief cooldown.
Tonight will be mostly clear and warm with low temperatures in the low to mid 70s.
Our clouds will increase throughout the day on Wednesday as that cold front makes its way in from the northwest. Our rain chances will start to pick up around midday day.
Scattered showers are likely and a few severe storms are possible through Tuesday afternoon and into the evening.
The rain and clouds will put a slight damper on our temperatures, but it will still be muggy with highs in the upper 80s.
We are under a Marginal Risk for severe weather Wednesday, which is a 1 out of 5 on the risk scale. That means a few severe storms with strong winds, heavy rainfall and frequent lightning are possible, but widespread severe weather is not expected.
The cold front will push through the Tri-State Wednesday night, but some of the rain will hang around behind it into Thursday, mainly in the morning. High temperatures will only make it into the low 80s.
That cooldown won't last long. High temperatures will return to the upper 80s with isolated rain chances throughout the weekend. Right now, Labor Day looks mostly dry but hot with afternoon temperatures near 90°.

On Alert For Wednesday Thunderstorms
We hit 94-degrees on Monday. High temps right back in the lower 90’s under mostly sunny skies. The heat coupled with the humidity will stretch the heat index to 98-102 this afternoon. Tonight will be clear and muggy with low temperatures in the lower 70’s.
On Wednesday Alert for strong showers and thunderstorms. We have a Marginal Risk for severe thunderstorms from noon until 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday.
Rain chances return on Wednesday as a cold front slides south from the Great Lakes easing temps in the upper 80’s. The best chances for showers and storms set-up Wednesday afternoon through midnight. On Thursday, cooler with high temps in the lower 80’s.

Hot & humid again Tuesday, on Alert for storms Wednesday
We have one more day of this hot and humid weather before showers and storms return to the forecast and high temperatures return to the 80s, but I have added an Alert Day as some of those storms could be strong or even severe.
Tonight will be warm and muggy with low temperatures in the lower 70s under clear skies.
Much like today, Tuesday will be mostly sunny, hot and humid with high temperatures in the lower 90s and heat index values around 100°.
Our clouds will increase throughout the day on Wednesday, and showers and storms are likely, mainly in the afternoon and evening, as a cold front moves in from the northwest.
I have added an Alert Day Wednesday because we are under a Marginal Risk for severe weather that day, which is a 1 out of 5 on the risk scale.
A few of those storms Wednesday afternoon and evening could be severe with gusty winds, heavy rainfall and frequent lightning, but widespread severe weather is not expected.
Some of the rain will linger into Thursday as that cold front swings through the Tri-State, but Thursday will also be the coolest day of the week with high temperatures in the lower 80s.
An unsettled weather pattern will keep hit-or-miss rain chances in the forecast through the weekend with high temperatures climbing back into the upper 80s.

A Sweltering Monday; Storms On Wednesday
High temps right back in the lower 90’s under mostly sunny skies.
Hottest school day to date under mostly sunny skies. Tonight will be clear and muggy with low temperatures in the lower 70’s. Little change on Tuesday as high temps remain cemented in the lower 90’s.
The heat coupled with the humidity will stretch the heat index to 100 this afternoon.
Rain chances return on Wednesday as a cold front slides south from the Great Lakes easing temps in the upper 80’s. The best chances for showers and storms set-up Wednesday afternoon through Thursday. There is a Marginal Risk for a few severe thunderstorms from Wednesday afternoon until midnight.

On Friday, I sent a letter to (Prince William County) Brentsville Supervisor Jeanine Lawson in response to her conduct on Election Day, the full text of which can be found below. I’m not one of her constituents, but the weight of her words and actions affect our whole county. Silence is not an option.
You can read more about the incident in question here.
—————–
Dear Supervisor Lawson,
As we enter this Thanksgiving Holiday weekend, we reflect on all of the blessings we have in our lives. Family, friends, faith, and so much more. I have been doing much reflecting of my own, and that is why I’m writing to you.
I’m writing to you in regards to your interaction with Evelyn and Heidi BruMar’s daughter on Election Day. It is no secret that I know their family personally, and because I care deeply about them, I know that I am far from an unbiased perspective. By the same token, I’ve read and seen enough to respect you; for your service to our county, for your commitment to your convictions, and for the care you show toward your constituents. It’s for those reasons that I don’t believe your words came from a place of intentional malice.
That all said, I feel that your conduct was both insensitive and disappointing. You may not have initiated the interaction, but the context of your reaction matters. Their daughter is a child who was already outnumbered by others who shared opposing viewpoints to her own. She is a teenager and was alone at a polling location on Election Day. You allowed others to belittle her beliefs loudly and publicly. In fact, you emboldened them with your mere presence. Depending on who else may have been present or passing by at that point, such behavior may be viewed as a form of voter suppression. You have struck me as an independent person, thinking for yourself with a grounding in facts over feelings; qualities of a leader. Your behavior on Election Day, though, runs counter-current to those qualities.
Again, I doubt this was your intent, but those of us who operate in the public eye know that impact often means more than intent.
Worst of all, you essentially told a child that her family is invalid in your eyes and in the eyes of the Creator. Even if you did not mean it in such a way, you implied that she is lacking a full life because she lacks a father and mother in the traditional sense. You likely have no idea what her past family situations were like, but such ignorance is not an excuse for your words. Those words perpetuate intolerance and a singular view of what can constitute a complete family. They also betray the notion that redeeming love can come in a wide variety of forms. Even if it wasn’t your intent, your words are encouraging to those who would spread fear, hatred and bigotry in our society.
Not too long ago, my own family would have been considered invalid in various circles. As I am the son of an interracial couple, I am keenly aware that the union of my own parents was seen as inappropriate in the “biblical sense” for the greater part of our history.
Was my family less because in some interpretations of scripture my parents were never meant to wed or have a child together? Did I live a less full live because of my mixed heritage, or the fact that my parents divorced when I was a child? What of children who have a biological mother and father who abuse them? Are they still better served simply because they have both of their “biblical sense” parents in their lives? Tradition matters, but what happens when life creates a different path?
I ask these questions not to offend, but to hopefully spur reflection. There was a time in which my beliefs in regards to family aligned almost identically to yours, but my experiences with families like the BruMars forced me to reflect over the years. In them, I see the same redeeming love that I see in families with heterosexual parents, foster parents, single parents, and in so many other familial configurations.
In closing, I know that there are likely things we disagree on, but I hope you can see through the noise of partisan rhetoric to understand that your actions have perpetuated division, and that your words have hurt a family. Regardless of your intent, damage has been done, and our community is a bit dimmer for it. If there is to be a silver lining though, it is that this interaction has opened the door for a much larger conversation. That must be the next step.
Thank you for reading, and I look forward to continued dialogue with you and the rest of our county supervisors. It is my hope that together, we can have earnest discussions on race, views on family, and a whole host of other issues facing our community.
Sincerely,
Kenny Boddye – Occoquan Resident

If you love running old content for transmog items, you'll love the new legacy loot system. Whenever a player enters a dungeon or raid where they are 10 or more levels above the content, the dungeon or raid bosses drop an amount of loot equivalent to what would have dropped for a full group when the content was current. That means players could earn loot for five people in dungeons and loot for 20 people after soloing a raid. The legacy loot system also drops other gear types, like cloth dropping for a plate wearer. It's now much easier to get the transmog gear you want, and you can also collect gear for your alts on the same run.
Certain locations in World of Warcraft – primarily inns, capital cities, and private instanced zones like your garrison or class order hall – are rest areas. You know you’ve entered one because your character portrait will gain a “Zzz” icon where your level is normally shown, and because you can immediately log out of the game instead of waiting 20 seconds.

Since it's like a premium version and it's not modifying game files it gets by somehow. I personally hate Zygor's guides and always have, it's just personal honestly. I understand some people like his guides and have no problem paying for them but I personally hate the idea of charging someone for an addon that - as this post points out - has plenty of bugs in it. These were fixed last week and if I'm paying cash for an addon I want that addon bug free and not causing a hassle and taking my time away when I could be doing a better job without an addon at all.
Once a week, you will be able to open a chest rewarding between one and three items, with the number and quality based on the difficulty of the highest M+ dungeon that you finished the week before. Unlike the end-of-dungeon chest, this chest can contain Azerite items. Gear from the weekly chest starts at 355 and can increase to 380, or 340/385 for Azerite pieces.
Some people have made arguments that quest blues can sometimes be more powerful than heirlooms, especially with sockets. I'm not convinced. The simple fact that you never have to even look at quest rewards will save a non-insignificant amount of time over the course of leveling. Also of consideration is the value of enchanted gear never having to be re-enchanted.
For Alliance it's Lok'Modan, Redridge, Darkshore, Felwood, Stranglethorn (both parts), Plaguelands. Somewhere between 3 - 3.5 of these get you to 60 in like a 16 hours /played, if you queue for dungeons at the same time. I recommend dropping everything at 45 and going to Darkshore-Felwood if you didn't do them yet - they are literally the fastest levelling zones in the game right now, maybe only trumped by Silverpine.
Meanwhile, on the island continents introduced in the Battle for Azeroth expansion, players level 110 and above who have unlocked world quests can participate in Faction Assaults. These special events, alternating between Alliance and Horde territory, will give each faction a chance to band together to defend their territory or invade their enemy’s via a series of world quests. The prize? Survival! Also faction, gear and gold. Maybe even some pride.
This kind of storytelling comes with problems, ones that players have been facing since the early days of the silent video game protagonist. Players in World of Warcraft have so much agency and choice when it comes to their own characters and how they build them. But despite their importance to the world itself, they can do nothing to change its story.
Some quests in my guide are marked as "SKIP" and colored in red. These quests are simply either too hard to solo or not worth the XP/time and are skipped. My guide will only list SKIPPED quests if the quest is a direct follow up after completing a quest, not one that you have to click the NPC again to get it. If you hover over the skipped quests, it will give info on why it is skipped in the guide (unless that info is already listed directly in the guide text).
War Mode, which allows players on PvE realms to turn on PvP combat and PvP realm players to turn it off, launched--offering a fairly measly 10% extra experience to leveling players for the privilege of getting ganked by max-level characters, or 10% increased world quest rewards for level-capped characters. For many players, that's not much an enticement.
Island expeditions require groups of three players to venture to islands with randomly spawned enemies and piles of AP. The island expedition ends once they collect a certain amount of AP, and they are granted about 300 AP as a reward — unfortunately, players don’t get any of the between 6,000 and 12,000 AP they collect during the expedition. These missions can take anywhere from three to 20 minutes, and never once offer any real challenge or depth.
Allied races are variants of existing races. The Void Elves are a version of Night Elves, while the Highmount Tauren are, you guessed it, a version of the Tauren. Four allied races are already in the game before launch and two more, the Dark Iron Dwarves and Mag’har Orcs, were added after Battle for Azeroth launched. Each Allied Race has its own racial abilities. You can also unlock a heritage armor set by leveling any Allied Race to the level cap.
“It’s challenging for sure,” said Cobo. “but I think that, ultimately, we have to look at what’s at the core of the faction [...] Everything is about honor when it comes to the Horde, and as the story unfolds and you start to learn about the motivations behind Saurfang, or the motivations behind Sylvanas and why she’s doing what she’s doing, it starts to create a perspective around, ‘Is that the kind of person that I want to follow?’
So much new stuff. The war questline expands. Island expeditions get a couple of new locations to explore. Azerite armor gets tweaked so it’s slightly less stupid than it already is. While we wait for the servers to go back up, Blizzard’s prepared a handy survival guide for Tides of Vengeance. I suggest looking it over, or else risk not surviving at all.
I have tried it a few times. It's good if you're new to the game. Otherwise not so much. I found I leveled slower by using it, as it's suggesting to take the longest possible route usually. Basically following roads everytime, when you could take an easy shortcut. Especially if the shortcut involves a bit of fall damage, it's out of question. The "go here" spots don't also update if you take a shortcut, and then the waypoint arrow points to wrong direction. But perhaps it has been updated since then.
Heirlooms: Heirlooms are the best source of bonus XP for leveling. All slots can be gotten pretty easily now, except the rings. The time you need to spend to get the rings if you haven’t gotten a level 3 shipyard in WoW is way too long, so getting the rings is generally not worth it. Having all your heirloom gear will boost XP by 55%. Generally, you want heirloom gear with crit on for leveling as you want to kill mobs in a few hits as possible
These stat priorities help to get a rough idea of what gear to go for, but the most important thing to get as soon as possible is your stat weights. Stat weights help you zero in on which stat is the most effective at increasing your healing. However, healers have no grand simulator, as there are a lot more variables that can affect your overall performance than there are for DPS specs. In light of that, healers use fight analysis tools like WoWAnalyzer and the Teachings of the Red Crane spreadsheet that takes logs from WarcraftLogs and gives you accurate weights that would improve your output.
-Island Expeditions- Island expeditions was one of the new features I was looking forward to but Blizzard no longer makes games that are ready when they are ready but rather makes games ready when the deadline comes. Thus, many of the new features are completely stripped down from what was expected and it's literally just a small scenario you enter with two other players to continue to grind out your Azerite neck piece.
Hopefully, you have a good idea how you want to begin your endgame experience in Battle for Azeroth. A whole new set of content will drop on September 4 when the Uldir raid opens up and the PvP season begins. That also marks the beginning of Mythic+ dungeons in BfA. Even after that happens, many of these tips and strategies for gearing up will still be the best sources of early gear for your new 120 characters.
Just like player item levels, the game's professions have become pretty bloated over time. Blizzard has made some updates to the leveling process before but Battle for Azeroth features a skill squish that should smooth things out considerably. Instead of having to level hundreds of points before you can start crafting Battle for Azeroth items, each expansion will have its own separate skill tier. In other words, you can start crafting Battle for Azeroth content right away, while the gear and items from other expansions will each feature their own separate counters. Your first Battle for Azeroth item will put you at 1/150 on the counter for the new expansion, no more grinding needed.
Battle for Azeroth (110-120) Leveling Tips and Consumables How to level from 110 to 120 as quickly as possible in WoW Battle for Azeroth, including recommended zone order, best consumables, general leveling tips, and best addons. Leveling from 1-60: Questing and Dungeons Recommended leveling paths for new players between 1 and 60 in World of Warcraft. Includes tips for questing zones and leveling dungeons. Heirloom Collections Guide A guide to the Heirloom Collections Tab. A complete list of all heirlooms, how much they cost, which vendors sell them, what currency you need, and more!
Elixirs serve the same purpose as Flasks, but the buff expires if you die. You'll only use these between 1-70, generally speaking, until you can start buying Flasks which persist through death. Try not to die, and carry extras just in case. If you can't find an Elixir with the stat you want, look under scrolls, since they count as battle or guardian buffs as well.
Another thing that disappointed me was how Zygor artificially separated their Pet & Mount, Titles Reputations & Macros from the Achievement & Profession guide to inflate their prices. This angered a lot of their existing customers like myself. Those guides should have been included with the Achievement guide because things like Pets, Mounts, Titles and Reputation involve completing a lot of achievements.
Once a week, you will be able to open a chest rewarding between one and three items, with the number and quality based on the difficulty of the highest M+ dungeon that you finished the week before. Unlike the end-of-dungeon chest, this chest can contain Azerite items. Gear from the weekly chest starts at 355 and can increase to 380, or 340/385 for Azerite pieces.
-Gameplay- Gameplay has largely been stripped down to be a shell of its former self. This trimming has been going on for several expansions, but now it's even worse. Classes only have so many buttons which has resulted in very little skill involved in PvE (even PvP is a faceroll for most melee, lacking any sort of depth and decision-making as it's pretty clear what buttons to press in any given situation) and it's become more of a gear check. This expansion gave zero new abilities to classes, only took them away.

This album is apparently quite different from their other stuff, because all the "muse fans" in this thread and the last one hate it. I like this one a bit, but when I listened to Black Holes/Revelations and Absolution, all the songs felt like watered down versions of each other.

Hillary Clinton’s notorious email scandal is now the but of sitcom jokes. Clinton’s cameo on the debut episode of the new “Murphy Brown” sitcoms included a gag about her being secretary of state and a reference to her maintaining an illegal private email server while she was on that job
“For four years I was the secretary … of a very large organization,” Clinton explained. “I do have some experience with emails.” She offered some homespun advice on producing a news show too: “Everyone works together. It takes a village.”
Brown thought “Hilary,” as he was named in the show, was “very impressive” but “maybe a little overqualified,” according to Variety.
Clinton’s donned her requisite pantsuit for the television role that had her looking for secretarial work at the fictional cable news show, “Murphy in the Morning.”
“Murphy Brown” was originally on-air from 1988 to 1998 and was now for its liberal political comment, including an infamous interjection into the 1988 presidential campaign when her character questioned the real-life comments of then-vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle who questioned the show’s positive depiction of being a single mother.

10 Best Bets for $75 or Less – Cheap Chukkas, Rain Ready Jackets, & Game Changing Underwear
April 19, 2017 By Joe | Heads up: Buying via our links may result in us getting a commission. Here's why.
Seventy Five bucks. That’s a lot of money. It’ll get you a couple pairs of Levi’s , a decent casual dinner out, or a couple months at your local gym. Ten picks follow, all for $75 or under, with some of them much, much less. Expect these round-ups on a monthly basis. Got a tip on something for under $75? Send those in to joe@dappered.com.
J. Crew French Linen Cardigan – $67.12 w/ HOPTOIT ($89.50)
“Summer sweater” can seem to be a bit of an oxymoron, but if you spend any time outdoors after dark, having an extra layer laying around the house or packed in your bag for the beach/lake is super handy. And while this 100% linen cardigan isn’t the cheapest thing in the world, it’ll look and breathe a heck of a lot better than that all cotton hoodie you’ve got smashed into a drawer.
Gustin Made in the USA Waxed Canvas Dopp – $49
The summer travel/vacation season is quickly approaching, so if if you’re due for an upgrade to what you keep your toiletries in while on the road? Now’s not a bad time to look for something new. These don’t ship until June (so if there’s an early summer jaunt in your future, this might miss that deadline), but fifty bucks for a waxed canvas, super sturdy, YKK zipper equipped dopp seems fair. Could you get a cheap, pleather option for much, MUCH less somewhere else? Of course! And more power to you if that’s what you want. But good luggage, even the small stuff, can make being on the road more comfortable.
Banana Republic Alexander Chukka – $70.79 ($148)
A basic chukka that can probably see use year round (yes, even in the heat… try em’ with chinos and a lightweight polo or linen shirt & cardigan). 4.9 out of 5 stars after 20 reviews. On sale, and thanks to the promo that BR is running, these things get an extra 40% taken off at checkout, no code needed.
“The Public Library” Candle – $21.20 w/ SPRING17
Paging our “Dappered Space” contributor. Designed to remind you of the racks of old books stored deep within a library, or, the most interesting man in the world’s study.
Target 4 Pocket Field Jacket – $49.99
Remember this steal alert for Filson’s Cover Cloth Mile Marker Coat? Right. If you rolled your eyes because those USA made jackets are just flat-out out of your price range, then here’s a much cheaper alternative. Stand up collar on these. Very much “imported.” Appears to have some sort of waterproof coating to it? Unlined. Plenty of pockets. Gunmetal snaps. Draw-cord at the waist allows you to make it more fitted if you so choose. Beat the hell out of it.
H&M Made in Portugal White Leather Sneakers – $59.99
From their “Premium Quality” line. Dead simple. Only real design accents is the pale grey suede patch at the heel. Leather is decent. Not amazing, but decent. Reinforced eyelets. Made in Portugal and leather lined.
Best Made Co. Enamel Tumblers – $15 ($32)
Great for sippin’ whiskey out of. Sure, you could use a plain ol’ rocks glass. You could also use a dixie cup. These? These are just different enough for around the fire or down on your back porch as the sun sets.
ExOfficio Men’s Give-N-Go Brief – $14 – $20
Now that winter is drifting away into the rear view mirror, many of us are thinking about how the hell we’re gonna be able to keep cool between now and autumn. There are many ways to accomplish this, but, one way to stay more comfortable than most when it gets warm? Skip the cotton underwear. All cotton underwear, no matter the cut, will just doom you to swamp crotch. Instead, wear something that has been engineered to breathe and wick. ExOfficio’s line of “give-n-go” underwear does just that. Diamond mesh pattern increases air flow. 94% Nylon, 6% Lycra Spandex material won’t hold on to sweat like cotton does. They’re odor resistant too. Some claim to only pack two pairs of underwear for any given trip. Wear one while the other is drying post end-of-day wash (and it’ll dry quick).
New Republic by Mark McNairy “Henderson” Buck – $51 ($68)
Once again, cheap suede almost always trumps cheap smooth leather. So these shouldn’t be that big of a risk. Classic spring/summer bucks, right down to the red-brick colored sole. Head here for a review of another model (a suede wingtip) in the New Republic line.
S-Town, the Podcast – Free
We aren’t so hot at telling stories anymore. The theaters are filled with Transformers remakes, and the 50 Shades of Grey series was a mammoth literary hit… before it joined Transformers “Age of Extinction” at the multiplex. S-town, on the other hand, might be one of the best stories told in recent memory. Brian Reed’s unfurling of this multi-faceted tale is brilliant. I sincerely hope it’s one day archived in the sound recordings section at the Library of Congress. Also, I wouldn’t be surprised in the least if it someday becomes taught along with the classics in some high schools. Even though it’s non-fiction. Which is hard to believe, since somehow, someway, it has a Shakespearean feel to it.

The Song of Deborah
About
DEBS AT WAR
During WWII, highly trained debutantes were recruited as spies and messengers for dangerous undercover assignments. Affectionately nicknamed ‘Debs at War’ these skilled women parachuted behind enemy lines to spy and report on the plans of the enemy. They intercepted secret communications, decoded critical messages, and couriered instructions between the command post and the frontline.
Israel’s third judge, Deborah, was the first Deb at War. Interceding for her nation, Deborah received God’s strategies on how to win the war for Israel. God aligned Deborah with a seasoned military leader and in unity they led Israel to victory in the most decisive battles of her time. Disciplined intercession, radical obedience, and a joyful heart qualified this Deb for war.
Today, militant Debs of War are rising. They train on their knees, interceding for their nation. In the heavenly armoury, they receive weapons of discernment and wisdom. At the sound of the trumpet, Deborahs are ready for war. With the burden of heaven deep in their hearts, God strategically aligns them with His Generals. With hearts lit with the oil of gladness, Debs at War courageously follow the Commander of Host into victory.

They must be doing something right in the music program at McGill University in Montreal. The Jensen sisters, Ingrid and Christine, finished their studies at McGill and now another young woman from B.C., Anita Eccleston, who graduated from McGill is out to make her mark on the music scene in Canada. She has been part of the Kamloops Symphony Orchestra as a trumpet player and has been a lead vocalist and/or horn player in a variety of other bands encompassing big band, jazz and rock in Kamloops, BC. She recently moved to Vancouver and has now released her Jazz EP. It really is more than an EP and at around 33 minutes, there is more music here than there is on many pop CDs. Essentially, Eccleston has included recordings she has made over the last seven years with a variety of jazz groups. The constant, on every track, is that there is an electric guitar and a young man who knows how to play it and, of course Eccleston’s pretty voice. The arrangements are well thought out. Specifically, the jazzy arrangement of James Taylor’s “Don’t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight” is positively inspiring!
Eccleston shows off her trumpet and flugelhorn prowess on three of the tracks. On Hoagy Carmichael and Ned Washington’s “The Nearness of You” she plays a beautiful flugelhorn solo. She also plays a haunting trumpet intro on the opening track “Black Coffee.” I’m glad she chose to use the trumpet again on “My Funny Valentine” as that was the signature tune of horn player Chet Baker.
This Jazz EP is essentially an album of classic jazz standards, where Eccleston showcases a captivating voice that can tug on your heart strings. She shows exquisite phrasing on a number of tracks and she doesn’t just play it safe. She really shows her stuff on the difficult “Dry Cleaner From Des Moines;” the song that Joni Mitchell recorded on her homage to Charles Mingus.
There are many good musicians providing support on this CD. I was particularly impressed by the interplay of guitarist Matt Warnick and bassist Anna Ruddick on the classic “Summertime.” Also, Vancouver’s Chris Gestrin did a nice job of mastering the various recordings from different sessions.
Fans of classic vocal jazz will definitely enjoy Anita Eccleston’s Jazz EP.

An Embarrassment
By: Karen Bass &vert; 17/7/2018
I’ve never seen anything like what we witnessed yesterday in Helsinki. A US president siding with the man who was responsible for attacking our democracy — over our own intelligence agencies. If you looked at your TV screen closely, you could almost see the strings Vladimir Putin was pulling as Donald Trump embarrassed himself and our country.
This is a moment in US history that I will always remember and one that we must respond to with resounding conviction, by standing up for our values, our country, and our democracy — even if the president won’t.
If Trump won’t defend our country, we will — and we’ll do it together. I hope that I can count on your support as I continue to stand up to Donald Trump and keep his administration in check. Apparently, we’re competing with Russia in this effort, so our solidarity is critically important.

Taylor Swift Groping Case Heads to Jury

DENVER (AP) — The Taylor Swift groping case has headed to a jury in federal court in Denver.
The jury got the case for deliberations Monday after Swift’s attorney Douglas Baldridge questioned former DJ David Mueller’s credibility in closing arguments.
In dueling lawsuits, Swift said Mueller groped her at a backstage 2013 event and Mueller accused Swift, her mother and a Swift representative of getting him fired while denying the groping accusation.
Baldridge noted Mueller lost audio recordings he took secretly during a meeting with his bosses after he was fired from a Denver country music station.
He said that “no credibility goes with a story-changing, evidence-destroying aggressor like David Mueller.”
The eight-member jury must rule unanimously on Mueller’s claim that Andrea Swift and Frank Bell wrongly caused Mueller’s firing. A judge removed Swift as a defendant in the firing claim.
The jury also must reach a verdict on Swift’s counterclaim of assault and battery and her request for a symbolic $1 judgment.

The Harry Potter franchise has had no scarcity of controversies through the years. The books have been repeatedly banned and questioned, and even tops the record of the American Library Affiliation’s most challenged books of the 21st century. Even after the conclusion of the primary guide and film collection, the debates have solely grown extra heated through the years. J.Okay. Rowling’s statements proceed to ship shockwaves throughout each the Wizarding World and our personal, together with revelations about Dumbledore’s orientation, Nagini’s actual id, and even Voldemort and Bellatrix’s secret daughter.
Amongst probably the most polarizing characters of the collection is Severus Snape, the brooding Potions Grasp of Hogwarts. He exhibits an intense distaste for Harry proper from the beginning and continues to make the boy’s life more durable than it must be. Snape finally makes an awesome sacrifice, motivated by his love for Lily Evans, and it prompts Harry to call his personal son after his Potions Professor. Whereas some might view Snape’s timeless love for Lily as a love story to finish all love tales, there’s no denying that he’s accomplished some questionable issues through the years. Snape’s faults are a part of what makes him such a compelling character, they usually’re value analyzing with out making excuses for him.
The listing under accommodates supplies from the core seven books of the franchise and all eight of the primary films, so no want to fret about getting spoiled for any of the Unbelievable Beasts spinoff movies.
Listed here are 20 Things Wrong With Snape We All Choose To Ignore.

19 2 He Makes use of His Childhood As An Excuse
20 1 He By no means Exhibits Regret
20 He Torments Harry From The Begin
Snape establishes himself as a bully proper from his first look in The Sorcerer’s Stone. Harry is already recognized all through the Wizarding World as “The Boy Who Lived” although he’s solely eleven years previous. Snape exhibits no sympathy for a kid who’s misplaced his mother and father and has spent all his life in an abusive family.
As an alternative of being knowledgeable educator, he makes enjoyable of Harry’s celebrity– although he himself is partially answerable for the boy’s tragic previous. Snape might have used the state of affairs as an opportunity to honor Lily’s reminiscence and maintain Harry. As an alternative, he chooses to admonish a mistreated youngster as a result of Harry reminds him of Lily and James.
19 He Is Neville’s Boggart
First launched in Prisoner of Azkaban, a Boggart is a creature that takes the type of one’s biggest worry. As a testomony to how terrible a instructor Snape is, Neville’s Boggart takes the form of the poisonous Potions Grasp.
Some may view this as an indication of how timid Neville is, however take into account the context through which this occurs, too: Sirius Black had simply damaged out of Azkaban, the one recognized escape from the high-security jail on the time. Neville isn’t afraid of the convicted felony infamous for allegedly ending the lives of over ten people– what he’s really afraid of is his Potions Professor. As compared, Lupin’s Boggart is a full moon, and Harry’s is a Dementor.
18 He Makes Enjoyable Of Hermione’s Thirst For Information
Okay, Hermione might come off as a snobby know-it-all at occasions, particularly when she’s simply beginning out at Hogwarts, however that’s not a purpose for Snape to make enjoyable of her in entrance of her friends. To prime all of it off, he’s a instructor. If something, he must be encouraging her thirst for information whereas assuaging her anxieties about overachieving, not ridiculing her for being an keen learner. A proactive scholar! Oh, the horror!
Snape expects nothing much less of perfection from even his lower-level college students, however when one among them dares to excel, he makes enjoyable of her for it. Snape’s inconsistency is unprofessional and his continually shifting aim posts are arbitrary and unfair. It is yet one more aspect that undercuts his qualifications as an educator.
17 He Makes Neville (Virtually) Poison His Pet
Neville—amongst many different college students—is afraid of Snape, and with good cause. Snape is imply to just about everybody for no purpose, along with being a reasonably dangerous instructor who expects no errors. To prime all of it off, Snape even threatens Neville’s pet toad, Trevor.
Throughout a very terrible Potions class, Snape makes Neville feed his Shrinking Answer to Trevor, including that Trevor will in all probability not survive it as a result of Neville had made errors within the course of. Neville is understandably shaken. Hurting a child’s pet is textbook youngster abuse. Plus, Snape is telling Neville to poison his personal toad himself! It’s astonishing that Snape is ready to do all of this and get away with it.
16 He Then Punishes Neville For Getting Assist
A lot to Neville’s aid, Trevor doesn’t get poisoned. Actually, the toad efficiently turns right into a tadpole. You’d assume it’d be trigger for reward, or a minimum of only a silent glare from Snape. No, Snape takes 5 factors from Gryffindor as a result of Hermione had helped Neville make the Shrinking Answer.
Positive, it’s not probably the most moral factor to get exterior assist by yourself work, however Hermione’s assist might be the one factor that retains Trevor alive. Additionally, Neville having to ask for a classmate’s assistance is yet one more testomony to how poor a instructor Snape truly is. He supplies nothing however unfavorable suggestions that helps precisely nobody. There’s no profitable with Snape, and every little thing you do will get you punished a method or one other.
15 He Exhibits No Compassion
It’s crucial to be punctual and to stick to official gown codes, so we will perceive why Harry acquired factors deducted for being late to the primary day of Hogwarts in Half-Blood Prince. However right here’s the kicker: Harry is actually coated in blood as a result of he’d been attacked by Malfoy on the Hogwarts Categorical and left motionless underneath the Invisibility Cloak. He wouldn’t have made it off the practice if Tonks hadn’t discovered him and healed his damaged nostril in time.
As an alternative of questioning why a sixteen-year-old boy is drenched in blood, Snape chooses to punish Harry with out contemplating the context. Had Snape recognized that Malfoy did it, he in all probability would’ve let his cherished scholar go on his merry method with out punishment, too.
14 He Makes Enjoyable Of Hermione’s Look
Hermione’s mind and eagerness to study aren’t the one issues that Snape brazenly mocks her for. He has even made enjoyable of her look, and his cruelty is much more obvious once you put the incident in context.
Harry and Malfoy have a stand-off, and their curses hit bystanders as an alternative of one another. Hermione is hit by Malfoy’s Densaugeo hex which causes her entrance tooth to develop to alarming proportions, previous her collar. Not solely does Snape not do something about it when he intervenes, he actively shames Hermione, telling her that he sees no distinction in her tooth regardless that they’ve now been magically enlarged. However, Snape sends Goyle to the hospital wing instantly.
13 He is Unabashedly Biased In the direction of Slytherins
Based mostly on Snape’s differing angle in the direction of Goyle and Hermione, who had each been hit by stray spells, you possibly can already see his immense bias in favour of Slytherins. Snape is the Head of Slytherin Home, a task that makes him accountable of taking good care of and disciplining the scholars within the Home. Nevertheless, Snape conveniently forgets the second a part of his duties.
He routinely takes factors away from different Homes for the pettiest of causes, all whereas permitting Slytherins to run free. Positive, every Head of Home belonged to stated Home throughout their faculty years, so there could be a little bit of a gentle spot for their very own college students, however no one else exhibits such blatant favoritism.
12 He was all the time Fascinated With The Darkish Arts And Blood Supremacy
Born to the pure-blood witch Eileen Prince and the Muggle Tobias Snape, Severus Snape is technically a half-blood wizard. He takes on the nickname “Half-Blood Prince” as a strategy to determine together with his Wizarding heritage due to his poor relationship together with his father. This turbulent upbringing drives him in the direction of the Darkish Arts and blood supremacy from a really younger age.
His tough childhood isn’t his fault, in fact, however all through his years at Hogwarts, surrounded by probably the most sensible minds and numerous concepts, Snape solely will get extra fascinated with these disturbing ideologies. Even his life-long friendship and obsession together with his Muggle-born neighbour Lily Evans don’t make him assume twice about his help for blood supremacy.
11 He Calls Lily A Slur
Snape and Lily go approach again earlier than their Hogwarts days, and Snape has been enamored together with her for years. The 2 stay buddies at college, and Lily is the one one who involves Snape’s protection when the Marauders bully him when Snape’s worst reminiscence is revealed in Half-Blood Prince.
In response, Snape calls her a “Mudblood,” a extremely offensive slur for Muggle-born witches and wizards. Lily will get rightfully outraged, and understandably stops being pals with him. Snape regrets utilizing the phrase not as a result of it’s improper and bigoted, however as a result of he’s harm by Lily’s determination to cease speaking to him. Snape brings this skewed ethical compass nicely into maturity, making little or no progress in the direction of truly embracing Muggles and Muggle-born witches and wizards.
10 He Turns into A Demise Eater
Not all Slytherins are evil. We all have that one Slytherin good friend who’s nice at asserting themselves and defending their beloved ones– however Snape isn’t one in every of them. When he graduates from Hogwarts, he promptly joins Voldemort’s ranks as a Dying Eater, full with the Darkish Mark on his forearm. There’s no canonical proof that Snape immediately harmed anybody, however he’s a recognized spy for the Darkish Lord, facilitating Voldemort’s torment of Muggles and Muggle-borns.
Redemption isn’t unattainable. There are individuals each within the Wizarding World and in our personal universe who’ve turned their backs on their previous bigotry and altered for the higher. Nevertheless, Snape’s change in allegiance isn’t motivated by a real change in ideology.
9 He Solely Modifications His Thoughts For Lily
Snape’s change of coronary heart solely comes when he overhears Sybill Trelawney’s prophecy about Voldemort’s downfall. He eavesdrops on Trelawney and Dumbledore on the Hog’s Head and will get thrown out earlier than listening to all the prophecy. Nonetheless, he relays what he is aware of to Voldemort. The Darkish Lord decides that Harry’s the Chosen One, and Snape realizes that he’s simply doomed the love of his life, Lily. It’s then, and solely then, that Snape modifications his thoughts and begs Dumbledore for assist cover Lily.
Snape solely switches allegiance out of his obsession for Lily– not as a result of he’s come to the belief that his blood supremacy is pure bigotry and that harming Muggles is dangerous. Altering his thoughts out of selfishness is best than not altering his thoughts in any respect, however he definitely hasn’t earned his redemption.
eight He solely tries to save lots of Lily’s life
Earlier than Snape runs to Dumbledore for assist, he approaches Voldemort first to plead for Lily’s life. At first look, that appears sweet– till you understand that his cope with the Darkish Lord includes exchanging Lily for Harry and James. Lest we overlook, Harry continues to be an toddler at this level.
Snape isn’t in any respect involved with Voldemort taking up the world by ending the lifetime of an harmless youngster and his father, so long as he might be with Lily in a world that deems Muggle-borns like her inferior. After Lily’s passing, Snape turns into a double agent to assist guarantee Harry’s security and honouring Lily’s sacrifice. How bullying an eleven-year-old counts as respecting Lily’s reminiscence is past us.
7 He Ignores A Crying Orphan
Within the film model of The Deathly Hallows, Half 2, there’s a flashback to the night time of the Potters’ passing in Godric’s Hole. It’s an addition by screenwriter Steve Kloves that doesn’t seem within the ebook, nevertheless it illuminates Snape’s motivations even additional. Snape runs to the Potter residence after their confrontation with Voldemort, and makes a beeline for Lily’s susceptible determine mendacity on the bottom. He straight-up ignores a crying child in his crib, sitting proper subsequent to his deceased mom.
Grief for a misplaced liked one is horrible and could be incapacitating, nevertheless it’s fairly heartless to go away a toddler alone when you hug a lady you’ve been disrespectful and bigoted towards, regardless of your love for her.
6 He Tries To Out Lupin
In Prisoner of Azkaban, Lupin takes days off from educating Protection Towards The Darkish Arts to accommodate his transformations right into a wolf throughout full moons, and to recuperate from the agonizing expertise. Snape has lengthy been eyeing the place of DADA Professor, and subs in for Lupin.
Lupin provides Snape directions and Hermione even explains the place they’d left off, however Snape nonetheless opts to dive proper into the werewolf part, hoping that a scholar would work out the rationale for Lupin’s absence. Snape does assist Lupin out with Wolfsbane Potion that makes transformations simpler, however that doesn’t negate the truth that he repeatedly tries to out Lupin, exposing him to intense systemic prejudice within the Wizarding group.
5 He Makes Enjoyable Of Tonks’ New Patronus
As if Snape’s prejudice towards werewolves— and Lupin particularly— isn’t sufficient, his distaste extends to those that related to them as nicely. After Tonks saves Harry from the Hogwarts Categorical in Half-Blood Prince, she conjures her Patronus to ship phrase to the fort. Harry merely perceives the Patronus as a four-legged animal, however Snape realizes that it’s truly a wolf that displays Tonks’ love for Lupin, very similar to how his personal doe Patronus symbolizes his love for Lily.
Snape promptly sneers at Tonks, saying that her new Patronus seems to be weak. Not solely is he insulting Lupin and his lycanthropy, but in addition Tonks, for falling in love with a werewolf whom Snape considers beneath him.
four He Will get Indignant When Harry Defends Himself
Legilimency is a approach to invade somebody’s thoughts and skim their deepest, darkest secrets and techniques. Occlumency is its reverse, a method of defending one’s thoughts from these makes an attempt. In an effort to shield Harry from Voldemort, a extremely expert Legilimens, Snape is tasked with educating Harry Occlumency.
On the floor it’s a noble and important a part of defending Harry, however the best way Snape goes about it’s too harsh. Dumbledore chooses Snape due to his expertise, however Snape’s hostility in the direction of Harry will get in the best way of their classes. Snape repeatedly invades Harry’s thoughts whereas giving him little or no information on the best way to defend himself. Harry actually tells Snape to cease, however Snape retains going. To shield himself, Harry makes use of Legilimency on Snape, who then will get enraged. How dare a weak fifteen-year-old defend himself from violation!
three He Created Sectumsempra For Enemies
Throughout Harry’s sixth yr at Hogwarts, he finds a Potions textbook belonging to the Half-Blood Prince, a.okay.a. Snape. Within the e-book, he finds modified directions for numerous potions, in addition to unique spells, together with one referred to as “Sectumsempra.” Because it seems, it’s a extremely harmful curse that slashes individuals aside, inflicting deep wounds that put the sufferer vulnerable to passing. Plus, any physique elements which are reduce off can’t be regrown, like George Weasley’s severed ear.
To prime all of it off, a teenaged Snape had written “for enemies” subsequent to the incantation in his previous textbook. Whilst an adolescent, he had no qualms about damaging his fellow college students so severely that they could lose their lives from blood loss.
2 He Makes use of His Childhood As An Excuse
Okay, Snape had a tough childhood. He was born to a pure-blood witch and a Muggle father, and his mother and father typically fought with one another and uncared for younger Snape within the course of. Nevertheless, Snape is way from the one tormented soul within the Wizarding World. There’s Harry, who loses his mother and father and is raised in an abusive residence, and is additional picked on by Snape himself. Neville can also be a toddler with a troubled previous, however nonetheless makes use of his trauma for good.
Somewhat than confronting his personal dysfunctions like a grown grownup, Snape repeatedly makes different individuals— even youngsters— bear the load of his ache. Like Snape says, life isn’t truthful, however that doesn’t imply he ought to make it more durable for different individuals, too.
1 He By no means Exhibits Regret
In the long run, Snape redeems himself in lots of Potterheads’ eyes. Even Harry is so grateful for him and his sacrifice that he names his baby after him, sparking numerous memes. Nevertheless, it’s necessary to notice that Snape by no means truly exhibits regret or apologizes for his problematic conduct.
Recognizing that you simply did dangerous issues and made errors is an important a part of atonement, however at no level does Snape truly make an apology or come to see the error of his methods. He’s seemingly motivated purely by his personal egocentric obsession with Lily, with out regard to justice or peace. Sure, he does play an element in defending Harry, however he does it whereas unnecessarily making the boy’s life a dwelling hell.

The Environmental Protection Agency has ended a nearly $1 million program that provided gym memberships for employees.
The new administration under EPA administrator Scott Pruitt identified the gym memberships as an abuse of taxpayer dollars. Examples of the program's misuse included $15,000 for gym memberships for 37 EPA scientists in Las Vegas last year.
"We have ended taxpayer-funded fitness centers at EPA; a program that was costing American taxpayers $900,000 per year," said EPA spokesperson Jahan Wilcox. "Disinvestment in using federal funds for EPA fitness centers will allow the agency to invest this money in core activities to protect the environment."
Pruitt vowed an end to taxpayer-funded programs after the Washington Free Beacon report on the agency spending $15,000 on gym memberships in Las Vegas, earlier this year. Employees in the U.S. Environmental Science Division billed taxpayers $399 each for gym memberships, even though employees had access to a "state-of-the-art" gym on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) campus.
The campus gym includes a relaxation room with massage chairs, fitness assessments, personal trainers for hire, a registered dietician, a spa and leisure pool, indoor jogging, and a "gender neutral bathroom."
The EPA began notifying employee unions last week that the agency is discontinuing fitness subsidies and fitness center funding, according to an EPA official.
The benefits will officially end on July 31, and no additional funds for fitness centers will be provided. For facilities that already have gym equipment that is paid for, the EPA will no longer pay for the maintenance of the equipment and will not purchase any new equipment.
The Trump administration has proposed cutting the EPA budget by 31 percent.

Trending: Why Did NBC News Knowingly Sit On This Important Kavanaugh Detail?
“In its latest diatribe against Bill O’Reilly, the Times printed leaked information provided by anonymous sources that is out of context, false, defamatory, and obviously designed to embarrass Bill O’Reilly and to keep him from competing in the marketplace,” Mark Fabiani said in a statement to CNN on Saturday.
O’Reilly reportedly paid a $32 million settlement in January to a colleague who accused him of sexual harassment, a substantial addition to the $13 million previously reported for other allegations. O’Reilly’s contract was renewed not long after, but then he was forced out of Fox in April when some of the allegations were made public.
Fabiani maintained that O’Reilly was falsely accused in the wake of allegations against Fox News founder and CEO Roger Ailes, who was forced to resign the network in 2016.
“Dozens of woman accused scores of male employees of Fox News of harassment — including the current co-president of Fox News, Jack Abernathy,” the attorney said. “21st Century Fox settled almost all these cases, paying out close to $100 million. Six months after Mr. Ailes left the company, Fox News Corporation signed Bill O’Reilly to a record-breaking contract after the company had analyzed and considered all allegations against ……..

A Proposed Plan that may lead to Your Destiny in Mission
As the cool invisible mountain breeze of East Africa rolls over the last glowing sunset of my April stay here, I imagine what the Prophet Elijah must’ve felt while resting in the wilderness after the Jewish princess Jezebel threaten to kill him. With its lush green views from the lanai of my guest room at Lake Nakuru Resort, I felt well rested after a long, but successful mission journey here in Kenya.
God used me mightily at every turn, trekking some distance of about 16,400 miles in total! Every encounter with people young and old was a humbling experience. Despite the human casualty of 149 university students killed in the town of Garrisa three weeks ago, the Kenyan people are resilient and strong. They are determined to face new obstacles and bury old colonial-ruled lifestyle patterns. Its people will sound a new trumpet of Zion; awakening every living creature that roams and breaths on their rich fertile lands.
I can’t wait to reschedule my spring visit next year and continue the work of sharing God’s message, instilling hope, and encouraging the discouraged.
By looking out onto this beautiful quiet sunset evening, I can’t help but to listen to the blowing wind mixing with the whistling chirping of birds and the call of insects boldly declaring their presence to the world. Was this temporary image supposed to give me the feeling of the Garden of Eden? Think about it, no arguments of fussing, no sounds of honking cars, no slaughter of animals….yet! And most of all, no stress! Can you imagine….
By the time you read this, I’ll be back into the grind of everyday life back in the United States, but (God willing) the next mission adventure will be in Jamaica W.I. this summer.
My prayer for the country of Kenya is that God does a new thing for its people. His plan will bring a cool fresh breeze on its people to become more unified than ever before. His blowing clear wind will remove the tainted attitudes and His gentle hand will be open to welcome those who will surrender to Him.
My personal prayer is that you’ll join me in 2016. Newly scheduled international mission trips will be posted on our website starting this week (June 5)! To view each destination, please visit: www.lifewalkmission.org. Perhaps next year while sitting on the lanai, I’ll look to the left or right of me and see you too, wearing worn socks and writing your mission journey in Kenya!

What we saw from the cheap seats…
August 2, 2015
There was a photo that one of the music majors took for their cover story on Mark Ronson. I guess it was after the hype and play of the Version days, around when Record Collection was due for release. In it, Mark was putting on a scowl, but it was obvious that he was trying to hide the laughter lurking behind it. He was holding a trumpet which he’d broken, presumably across his knee, with the headline printed along with his name a quote on how he doesn’t want to work with trumpets again. It is ironic, because during this tour, Ronson was at his best when flanked by his horn section.
Mark Ronson,
Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, July 29, 2015…
This was my first visit to Margaret Court Arena (as I hadn’t been able to attend the Wombat’s Splendour Sideshow the previous night due to an engagement next door) and it is certainly a venue with pros and cons. As a smaller concert venue than its older brother Rod Laver, it brings a surprising warmth and illusion of intimacy to the arena setting. Upon arrival, staff recommended that patrons use the facilities outside the arena in the Melbourne Park precinct to avoid prophesied queues inside, with vague signage seeing me exit the restrooms onto a tennis court. Sadly, we are not in the midst of the Australian Open, so hilarity did not ensue this time. Inside the arena, I was greeted immediately by a long queue that did indeed snake its way around the outskirts of the venue that surely, I thought, could not be for the bathrooms? I followed the queue in the direction of my door to find it ended in what appeared to be the only bar for the evening. Hopefully this was the result of venue management misjudging the audience’s thirst on this occasion and choosing to open only one bar, and that there are actually other dedicated beverage facilities hidden away somewhere, otherwise this would constitute an unforgivable design flaw.
On the other hand, the hungry were well-catered to, with an assortment of food options to rival even those of the Araneta Coliseum. Event staff paced the expansive bar queue, deceptively recommending patrons order drinks from one of the dining venues. (Deceptive, as many did not serve liquor, and those which did seemed to only stock the house beer.) Once I’d foolishly conquered the bar queue, I found my way to what could be Melbourne’s best wheelchair concert viewing area.
Pond played as main support, and played it well, producing catchy electro-rock sounds not dissimilar to those of Midnight Juggernauts. It was an exciting set, which enforced the intimate feeling of the arena, and put the group on my list of bands to see again.
During the intermission after Pond, and elaborate band-stand style prop was revealed on a stage distressingly otherwise bare of instrumentation, and the staff at the main bar advised patrons that the beer had sold out. The show opened in strange and underwhelming fashion. The house lights were dimmed, but instead of any action on stage, the PA was turned up to play a Tamsin West’s closing theme to Round The Twist to a darkened venue. After a moment of awkward silence the fake band-stand lit up with bright white, while a pair of rappers I couldn’t identify bounded onto stage to rap over a video of Mystikal singing Feel Right. The emergence of Mark Ronson himself, atop the centre pillar of the illuminated band-stand, was peculiarly overshadowed by the bold karaoke lyrics projected behind the animated dancing of Mystikal on screen.
It was when feature singers started emerging to the stage that the show really kicked off, with The Bamboos’ Ella Thompson impressing on vocal duties for Bang Bang Bang, the early sing-along remaining the night’s highlight, though closely followed by The View’s Kyle Falconer shyly reprising his Bike Song vocals. Business Intl songs stole the show from the current album selection. The show came to life when Mark took to the stage from behind the props to take up his guitar, and Mark himself looked to be particularly enjoying jamming with Kirin J. Callinan. It was a shame – though not a surprise, and understandable – to have Valerie played with an empty stage and Amy Winehouse’s piped vocals instead of utilising one of the many guest singers (Daniel Merriweather was, after all, featured only briefly and might have changed up another of the Version covers.)
These DJ shows are always a tricky thing to enliven, but Mark Ronson ended up doing well after a shaky start, though shouldn’t be afraid to feature more live instrumentation, because those moments were when this trip to Melbourne really shone. After pronouncing his excitement at playing his first arena show tonight, it would seem he can pull it off, though I’ve no doubt he won’t have any problem returning to clubs either.

Being You The Extended Adventure

In 2008 I reached my limit of playing by the rules of an overbearing authoritarian cultural / religious structure that I had tried to follow obediently my entire life. For my whole life I had tried to be the good girl, and tried to get right…Instead, it had only made me increasingly depressed and angry. I said, out loud, in that church’s testimony meeting, with every fiber of my being shaking and excited, “this is not working for me. This is killing me. I am me. I am going to go beyond these 4 walls to find out all about prosperity. I know you can have a life of prosperity beyond these four walls! I am going to go find out All about living beyond what these boundaries have defined ME and LIFE as being… I don’t know what that means. But I am starting … That’s all I have to say. Thank you.” Saying that in a testimony meeting in this religion had been virtually unheard of by anyone up to that point. Since then, vocal dissension by brave people is becoming a common occurrence.
For 3 years I plugged away at work as a nurse, and I felt a bit freer, having shed one cloak of ideology that was not working for me.
But much more still was bubbling up to be alchemized. I was looking for a good place to be as a nurse. Instead, I found myself hopping from job to job, hoping that this would be ‘it.’ That somehow, things would work out. I was judging myself as somehow wrong every time I left a job. The pain of self judgment stings!
In 2011, I reached another point. I was exhausted and depleted and disenfranchised with my work. Nurses bleed out in the profession. They literally burnout and leave. Half of them leave the profession within five years of becoming a nurse. That is the kind of ‘health’ care of the current structure. So what did I do? I quit my floor job. I demanded that things change in my life. I was pleading for something new to please find me. Then I came across the work of Dr Dain Heer, co founder of Access Consciousness, and author of Being You, Changing The World.
Although I was in the best shape of my life, having just run a marathon, and a supposedly acceptable size 10, according to society’s standards, I was miserable. I was inflicting loads of self judgment. I was torturing my body with extreme calorie counting and forceful obsessive exercise. I listened to Dain on the radio while stretching, having just finished a run. I was so anxious for relief. Dain had us do an exercise. He asked us to pick an area that we were upset with, an area we were in huge amounts of judgment with. I thought to myself, “Ha! That’s Easy! I have so many!” I picked my body image. He asked us to repeat several times with him out loud, “Interesting Point Of View I Have This Point Of View.” That shifted things for me instantly, for the first time, ever. Up to that point I was using every alternative modality and new age technique and teaching under the sun. They would work for a little while before the emotional pain would creep back in. I was just so-so in life. So, I was still stuck in the pattern I had learned of trying to get it right, and be good.
I began utilizing the tools of Access Consciousness. As I have continued to do so, life has and continues to get easier and more joyful. I have, in the area of prosperity particularly, already exceeded my wildest expectations for my life. And I know it is just the tip of the iceberg. For example, I now live in a 7 bedroom 5 bathroom house on 0.5 acres. I have more space available to me. I know what it is to receive, in a whole new way. How did I get here? By utilizing the tools of Access Consciousness! Please get that Access Consciousness is not an answer. It is not a community. Rather, it is a set up tools, techniques, and processes designed to facilitate you to change whatever isn’t working for you. These tools help you to have more ease and joy with whatever is going on in your life. And to empower you to know that you know. For some great tools, refer to my blog post “How To Change Anything – Four Tools To Get Unstuck Fast.“
I am not going to say that because of Access Consciousness or Dr Dain Heer, I am healed. I am not going to say that bells and choirs of “Ah!’ make up my current life. Becoming more conscious is a journey, not a destination. What I will say is that as I apply the tools to my life and living, I am aware I am much more me and much more free. I am much more aware of my capacity to facilitate people around me to have greater choices, possibilities, as well as more ease, joy, & glory. I know I have infinite choice and access to infinite possibilities. I enjoy life more than ever before, and I have witnessed numerous miracles. I look forward to the future with much optimism and know I create miracles!
There are no tricks to being you. There are no secrets. There are no steps. The willingness to go beyond what is defined to a place of vulnerability and courage…That my friends is where the space of being you begins.
What if you could wake up every day again with a wild enthusiasm for being alive?
You are invited to a very special event. Being You The Extended Adventure 1.5 Day Event is coming to Utah August 12&13th, 2016! This class has no prerequisites and every event is uniquely created by the people who choose to come. Together, we’ll go on a journey of creation…to a space that has never existed before. It’s one of the most undefined events of its kind, it’s only when you define something that you can limit it. Ever notice? Come here for more information. Check out the facebook event page here.
These classes are facilitated by special Being You facilitators worldwide and can give you an energetic experience of being that you won’t find anywhere else…The fabulous Donnielle Carter is facilitating this class. She is an author of Right Body For You, and an extraordinary facilitator. My aunt had one bars session and read this book, and within a few months, had shed 4 clothing sizes! It’s phenomenal to help you experience more joy and ease and being with your body.
One thing I know for sure, is that government will not change this world. Ideologies or belief systems of any kind will not change this world. Those institutions and belief structures are designed to perpetuate themselves consistently, as well as maintain judgment and limitation. When we buy into those paradigms as being the answer, we destroy possibilities for a sustainable future on this planet. We destroy possibilities. When we align and agree with maintaining judgment of any kind, we have no choice other then continue to kill each other and the planet. Is that what you desire?
So, with that, take a breath. Let Go. Good.
Consciousness includes everything and judges nothing. . . .
Now. Take another breath. ….
Good.
Oneness includes everything and judges nothing. . . .
I ask you to drop your barriers and expand out. Just Ask yourself to do so. You know. You always know.
Now, I have a question for you.
What if you being you is the gift, magic, and change this world requires?
and also,
Is now the time to be what and who you actually came here to be?
Welcome to Being You The Extended Adventure!
I invite you to check out Dain Heer’s special book Being You Changing The World. Would choosing to peruse or read that be light for you? This is available in book form and also audio book. For a FREE AUDIO of his first chapter, sign up here. Or, listen below. Choices Gallore!
What can we contribute to consciousness today? Cheers! ~Victoria

Israel/Palestine: UK officials to attend meetings at US embassy in Jerusalem despite London opposition to mission relocation
British diplomats and officials will attend meetings with American counterparts in the US mission recently transferred to the disputed city of Jerusalem despite London’s opposition to President Donald Trump over relocation of the mission from Tel Aviv to the Holy city.
The United Kingdom, France, Germany and much of the international diplomatic corps boycotted the inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem on May 14. London, Paris and Berlin have rejected President Trump’s December decision announcing the relocation of the mission from Tel Aviv.
Besides Arab and Islamic countries, Western powers and much of the international community slammed the decision, which jeopardizes the peace process and impedes the international consensus over the fate of the old city.
UK Middle East Minister Alistair Burt told last week, three days after the much criticized US diplomatic move, members of the British-Palestinian Policy Council that British officials and diplomats will be attending meetings in the building, Middle East Monitor (MEE) reports.
“When we asked him to confirm [that] UK officials would not attend meetings at the embassy going forward, as the UK does not recognize it, he was very clear that they would attend,” one source told the London-based media.
Burt’s remarks appeared to have been confirmed by the Foreign Office, which according to MEE, indicated that diplomats and other representatives will attend meetings at the embassy.
UK’s stance on the embassy relocation and at the same its decision to attend meetings at the facility puzzles politicians in the British-Palestinian Policy Council. London criticized Israel for the killing of over 60 Palestinians in a protest near the Gaza border with Israel in response to the US controversial move.
Kamel Hawwash, vice chair of the British-Palestinian Policy Council told MEE that the council was stunned by the decision.
Kamel regretted the hypocrisy of the British government.
Friday, UK abstained during a United Nations Human Rights Council vote on a resolution to assign international war crimes investigators to probe the massacre of Palestinian protestors.
The resolution was passed with 29 countries in favor. Other member countries abstained and only the US and Australia voted against it.

‘Cape’: MoneyWeek’s favourite valuation ratio
The conventional price earnings (p/e) ratio is great for deciding how cheap a share is. But Tim Bennett is an even bigger fan of its variant, the cyclically adjusted p/e ratio, (Cape). In this video, he explains why.

Second Thought – The Tenacity of Belief by Tim Parker	
Posted on October 25, 2016 by Tia Lalani	
Read psychology professor Tim Parker’s second thoughts on the US presidential election campaigns, and how the psychological phenomenon of tenacity may play a large part in the support Trump receives.
If you are like me, you are probably captivated by the US Presidential campaigns of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. A fascinating aspect of the Trump campaign is the approach taken by the Democrats, and also high-level anti-Trump Republicans, in responding to the outrageous statements made by Mr. Trump. How does one respond most effectively?
For example, Mr. Trump claims that he is “for” the middle class and “for” reducing offshore jobs. Why, then, is Mr. Trump’s support not reduced when opponents, or the media, point out that many of the products he sells, for example, his Donald J. Trump Collection shirts, are made in other countries. These shirts and other products such as perfume, cuff links and suits are made offshore in such countries as China, Bangladesh, and Honduras.
Why does he not lose support when it is conclusively demonstrated that he habitually – to give him the benefit of the doubt – makes “mistakes” in his claims? For instance, Trump has asserted that the USA is one of the highest taxed countries in the world when all the available evidence shows it is not. Why, also, did his supporters defend him when he attacked a Gold Star family (a family that has lost a child in the military)?
A number of well-known politicians, including Republicans like Mitt Romney, and Democrats like Mrs. Clinton and Joe Biden, have made speeches that have directly attacked Mr. Trump’s statements. What is the effect of these speeches that have revealed, and emphasized, how Mr. Trump has, at the very least, habitually stretched the truth?
Many psychologists would predict that these direct attacks would have little effect on the supporters of Mr. Trump. There are a number of factors that can help to account for this. For example, at Mr. Trump’s rallies, which are his primary campaign events, a basic mob or herd mentality might be promoting a self-reinforcing process of acceptance among those attending the rallies. It might also be the case that Mr. Trump comes across as a “strongman” who has induced unquestioning acceptance of his claims. While these factors might initially promote acceptance of Mr. Trump, they do not account adequately for his continued acceptance in the face of the fact-checking that is extremely easy for people to do.
A key factor that is at play here is a well-known phenomenon called tenacity. Simply put, there is a lot of evidence that when people who hold a strong belief are confronted with credible strong evidence to the contrary, instead of reducing their belief they are much more likely to believe more intensely. In addition, people are highly likely to quickly forget strong arguments against their position, while they are more likely to recall even weak arguments supporting their position. Thus, this effect tells us not to expect that direct attacks will reduce the support for Mr. Trump.
Similarly, leftist ideologues demonstrate tenacity in the face of the problems that have surfaced in Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. However, in light of the latest revelations about Mr. Trump advocating sexual assault, the focus is much more strongly on his supporters, than on Mrs. Clinton’s. One might expect that this latest scandal would begin to erode his support, but clearly many of his followers continue to support him even now.
Why, then, given the powerful tenacity effect, would both camps, Democrats, and many Republicans who are against Mr. Trump, choose to attack him directly? One possibility is that the advisors for both sides are not familiar with the tenacity effect, and chose to mount a conventional head-on attack. This might be the case, but it would invite the conclusion that perhaps the advisors are less than competent.
A more likely possibility is that the advisors are all too aware of this and are making these blatant head-on attacks for the benefit of the electorate that is undecided or against Mr. Trump. These constant attacks would have the effect of reminding people of the claims made by Mr. Trump and the extreme positions he has advocated.
This raises the uncomfortable possibility that Mr. Trump’s supporters are unlikely to change unless Mr. Trump himself causes them to question and mistrust him. On the other hand, those against Mr. Trump must fervently hope that continually attacking him will prevent others from joining his camp.

One response to Second Thought – The Tenacity of Belief by Tim Parker	
Ted d'Haene said:
Oct 27, 2016 at 8:30 AM	
I sense that people look at the Democrats and the Republicans against Trump as the elite who have no interest in the common person. This appears to be spreading throughout our society via the left leaning news media and educational institutions.
The ordinary person on the street feels like their freedoms, especially the freedom of speech, is constantly being attacked. So I can understand why so many people are supporting Trump because they can relate to him, even with his faults, more than the Democratic and Republican elite.
I can only hope that one day soon we have an individual who will stand up against the governing elite, news media and educational institutions in our own country who seem to be more preoccupied in shutting down free speech than actually discussing the issues openly and allowing everybody the ability to participate without fear of retribution.
Just my two-bits

5 Habits of Successful Investors

Jeremy Blossom
Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter
Sure, you can be a successful investor on your own, but learning from the best can really accelerate your learning. Here are five habits that five successful investors all do.
Do Your Homework
Investing is not a bucket of balls at the driving range. A wicked slice never hurt anything but your pride, but a bad investment could cause a costly ripple effect that reaches well beyond your checkbook. If you’re a beginner, you owe it to yourself to read up on the trillion-dollar, multi-national, hyperdynamic system we call ‘the marketplace’. Knowing the difference between futures and options, he effects of currency manipulation on foreign investments and understanding interest rates, dividends, capital gains, leverage, vesting, margins, premiums, volume–you get the idea. After you feel like you have a pretty good sense of the course layout, move on to tip two.
Have A Strategy
Do you know the difference between a Collar Strategy and a Calendar Spread Strategy? Are you a value investor? Do you believe that past performance is a reliable indicator of a given stock’s value? Finding the right strategy will allow you to invest within your budget and achieve your investing goals. A financial advisor can help you make sense of the various strategies and help you select the one that’s right for you. Of course, you can always dive into the market without a strategy, but you’ll probably wish you had one when the tide inevitably changes.
Set Goals and Stick To Them
Wealth, like Rome, wasn’t built in a day. It takes brains, a few lucky bounces, and no short supply of patience. Sit down with a financial advisor and set a list of realistic goals. Write them down. Read them often. Reconsider them at times. But whatever you do, don’t deviate from your goals at the first patch of rough water. A well-thought out, proven strategy can help you set achievable goals, an advisor can help you stick to them, but in the end it comes down to you to see them through.
Don’t Bet The House
When our back is against the wall, we often ask ourselves, ‘What have I got to lose?’ Well, depending on your investments the answer could be a lot! If a fund declines in value, it’s the fund’s job to recover! The last thing you want to do is try to compensate for an underperforming stock. If you have a strategy then that strategy should carry you through market downturns. Stick to the plan, stay within your budget, and if all else fails, see a financial advisor before you bet the house on a wing and a prayer.
Play Golf, Go Fishing, Learn to Cook
Investing, like Fantasy Football, has a tendency to become all-consuming. Unlike Fantasy Football, investing doesn’t have an offseason. So, find some separation from the market and keep your perspective. Remember, you’re investing because you want the financial freedom to do the things you love. So, don’t let the market keep you from living the life it’s meant to support.

Adobe Reader X - Sandbox, (Fri, Nov 19th)
Adobe released the Reader X version today. This is the version of Reader that has sandbox feature built-in, there is now a degree of separation between the OSand the potentially malicious PDF files. The same sandbox mechanism had been implemented in Google Chrome and also MSOffice. Containment of the harmful files lessen the damage should a successful attack were to happen. Given the amount of 0-day attacks on this software, we recommend our readers on Windows platform to upgrade to this version of Reader soon to leverage the sandbox technologies. While it does not prevent all exploitation, every little bit helps.
Adobe has written a series of blog entries explaining the sandbox mechanism. A good read if you are curious how it helps to protect against attacks. (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. http://isc.sans.org Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.

Exchanging and sharing of assessment results, (Fri, Nov 19th)
Penetration tests and vulnerability assessments are becoming more common across the whole industry as organizations found that it is necessary to prove a certain level of security for infrastructure/application. The need to exchange test result information is also increasing substantially. External parties ranging from business partners, clients to regulators may ask for prove of tests being done and also results of the test (aka. Clean bill of health).
The sharing of pentest information can create a huge debate, just how much do you want to share? There are at least a couple ways to get this done. The most seemingly easy way to do this is to share the whole report including the summary and also the detailed findings. While this seems easy, the party sharing out the report may be exposing too much information. Pentest reports can be like treasure map to attack an infrastructure and/or application. The detailed report usually include ways to reproduce the attack and effectively documenting a potential attack path in a step by step manner. It is true that vulnerabilities should be fixed as soon as possible after the pentest is done. Consider this scenario, the day after pentest is done, the regulators shows up and ask for the most recent test result. If you are not above the law, you should be yielding the latest report that is full of unfixed flaws.
Another way to share pentest result is to only share the executive summary portion. This portion of the test report usually gives a good overall view to what was done in the test and what sort of overall security posture the test subject is in. While this protects the party sharing out the test result, this may not grant the reviewer the right kind of information. Some executive summary does not contain sufficient information especially those ones done by less competent testers. Aside from that, one of the trend I am noticing is the less experience the receiver of test result, the more him/her want to see the whole report, they just dont know how to determine the security posture based on the executive summary alone.
There is no current industry standard for this kind of communication, it seems that all the exchange and sharing currently done are on ad-hoc basis. Some like it one way and others like it another way. I consider the current baseline for this kind of communication to be a well written executive summary containing actual summary information of the test with the methodologies used and also the high level view of the vulnerabilities that was found to be sufficient for giving a decent view into overall security posture. This obviously can escalate into a full report sharing if the quality of the executive summary just isnt there.
If you have any opinions or tips on how to communicate this kind of information, let us know. (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. http://isc.sans.org Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.

Two recent privacy breaches at the Veterans Affairs Department involved employees who disregarded information security protocols they were trained to follow, said Roger Baker, assistant secretary for information and technology at VA.
One incident involved an employee who plugged a personal unencrypted thumb drive into his computer at work and used it to inappropriately store Social Security numbers and other personal data for 240 veterans. The thumb drive was then lost inside a VA facility, found by a VA security guard, taken home by the guard and finally returned to VA officials, who declared the events a security breach.
In the other incident, a VA employee printed out Social Security numbers and other personal information on 180 veterans and took the papers home, where he typed the information into a Microsoft Word file on his home computer. When he tried to send the file to his work account via e-mail, VA's system flagged the message, resulting in discovery of the breach.

Christie dares NJ sanctuary cities to risk losing federal funds

New Jersey 101.5 video
Gov. Chris Christie told the mayors of the state’s two largest cities to “have at it” by declaring themselves “sanctuary” cities after the Trump administration once again threatened to cut federal funding.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday said such cities — which refuse to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws — risk losing grants that already have been awarded.
“People should just comply with the law,” Christie said Monday during his monthly appearance on New Jersey 101.5’s “Ask The Governor.”
After Trump signed an executive order in January that would defund cities that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities, Christie advised municipalities to take Trump at his word.
Christie also has vowed to veto any measure that would use state dollars to reimburse sanctuary cities for lost federal funds.
On Monday he called Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka by name.
“If they engage in voluntary conduct — which means sanctuary city is not mandated by the state; it’s voluntary conduct — then they think it’s important enough for their taxpayers to pick up the tab. Their call.
“Mayor Fulop, Mayor Baraka — have at it.”
There is no official definition of a sanctuary cities, but such municipalities often adopt policies that prevent police and local agencies from inquiring about people's immigration status. Officials say residents will be reluctant to come forward to report crimes and cooperate with investigations if they fear deportation.
Sessions on Monday did not release further details on how the federal government would go about cutting funds to local jurisdictions.
Last year, the Office of Justice Programs made nearly 3,000 grants totaling $3.9 billion to cities, counties, states and other local governments, the Associated Press reported.
Sessions said cities will have to show that they are in compliance before applying for $4.1 billion in grant money held by the Justice Department.

Trust in Trump and the trouble with taxes (Ask The Governor Highlights)
Louis C. Hochman
Gov. Chris Christie joins Eric Scott For Ask the Governor Dec. 22, 2016 (Louis C. Hochman / Townsquare Media)
Share on Twitter
Share on Facebook
It had only been days since President Donald Trump took office when Gov. Chris Christie — the first former rival of Trump's to endorse him during last year's GOP primary — joined Eric Scott for New Jersey 101.5's "Ask the Governor" Wednesday.
And already, Trump has taken action to scale back the Affordable Care Act — a key campaign promise. But Christie told Scott Wednesday he's not worried that'll endanger the governor's own priority for his last year in office — battling New Jersey's growing opioid addiction problem. Instead, Christie said, he's confident changes to federal policy will give governors the tools they need to set priorities locally.
Christie: I'm sure there was voter fraud in NJ
Also Wednesday, Christie said he agrees with Trump on moves to scale back funding to so-called "sanctuary cities" — those that have pledged not to work with the federal government on immigration enforcement or take such enforcement on themselves. And Christie said it'll be up to those local leader to explain to their constituents where the funding they depend upon has gone.
New Jersey property taxes were up nearly $700 million in 2016, as New Jersey 101.5's Michael Symons reported this week (see here to find out how much the average tax bill in your own town went up). And while Christie blamed the state Legislature for blocking some initiatives he said could have saved taxpayers money, he heralded legislative accomplishments such as a 2 percent (with some exceptions allowed) cap on year-to-year property tax growth. The governor also said he hasn't given up hope on more progress in the coming year.
When Christie leaves office, the state's first lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, hopes to replace him. But while Christie spoke with affection for his second in command, he wouldn't say whether she's up for a campaign — describing the process as a grueling one, and arguing there's no way to know if any candidate can withstand it until he or she tries. The governor also declined to endorse his lieutenant, saying it's better to see how the contested GOP primary progresses.

Let’s Talk About Healthcare: Can We Keep the Affordable Care Act?

Everyone seems to be talking about healthcare. And they should be, and you should be, too. This bill will have an effect on millennials, but how?
Let’s break this down… with some help from The New York Times.
The Affordable Care Act, nicknamed “Obamacare,” was passed in 2010 and allowed more Americans to be covered by health insurance for lower rates, and encouraged all Americans to get health insurance before they got sick. While the act definitely had some flaws, the intention behind it was to make sure that everyone had health care. One of the biggest topics during the election debates was how each candidate planned on improving Obamacare.
Since Obamacare was enacted, a lot of Republicans have wanted it removed, mainly due to the fact that in order to afford Obamacare, richer Americans are being taxed heavier. During the election process, Donald Trump made it clear that he wanted Obamacare repealed. As he transitioned into power, the repeal was one of the first things he set in motion.
The bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act would reduce Medicaid and would allow insurance companies to turn away more people with “preexisting conditions,” which is quite the opposite of what Obamacare is all about. No one should be turned away from healthcare, but evidently that is a difficult concept for people to grasp.
However, repealing the Affordable Care Act may not be in the best interest for Americans, as it was just revealed that repealing the act would cause 22 million Americans to become uninsured by 2026. Twenty-two. Million. Americans. Oh boy.
Many senators have come forward saying that should the bill to repeal Obamacare reach the Senate, they would vote against it. Senator Rand Paul stated “it’s worse to pass a bad bill than no bill.”
The choice now is to either withdraw the bill so that it can be improved upon, or keep it in so that it will inevitably be destroyed.
This begs the question — what can be done to improve Obamacare? Is it maintainable? Is it broken, or does it not need to be fixed? Does it beat the proposed alternative? Because the current plan seems to be causing more harm than good. It’s up to Trump and his administration to figure out a happy medium, so that Obamacare can be repaired while millions of Americans still get to keep their health insurance.
How will the proposed alternative, if passed, affect millennials? Well, many of us also have pre-existing conditions just like members of other generations. But that’s not the least of it. If millennials don’t purchase health insurance because the cost is just too high, when there is actually a medical problem that requires attention, we won’t be able to pay for treatment. Obamacare required the purchase of health insurance, and as a result, millennial medical debt decreased by 20% since 2010.
If the proposed alternative is passed, that figure has the potential to rise. We’ll be back in debt. We’ll be shopping for poor quality options. And worst of all, we won’t be healthy.

Kobach: If You Wanted to Pass a Law to Encourage Voter Fraud
Date: March 13, 2019Author: Nwo Report 0 Comments	
Source: Kris Kobach
On Thursday, on a party line vote, Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats in the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, dubbed the “For the People Act of 2019.” It is a massive federal intrusion into the states’ constitutionally-protected realm of regulating and maintaining voter rolls.
It’s also a recipe for voter fraud. Republicans in the House correctly derided it as a “voter fraud and election theft” bill. But that understates how bad it is. H.R. 1 rolls out the red carpet for election fraud.
This is true in multiple respects. A few of the most outrageous provisions in the bill are the following:
Preventing states from requiring proof of citizenship. The problem of aliens registering to vote has become one of the greatest threats to the integrity of American elections. In many states, the number of aliens on the voter rolls is in the thousands. Four states — Kansas, Arizona, Alabama, and Georgia — have addressed this problem by enacting laws requiring proof of citizenship to register. As Kansas secretary of state, I drafted our law and then defended it against the ACLU’s attacks in court. (The case is now on appeal in the Tenth Circuit.)
All of that would be in vain if the H.R. 1 were to become law. The bill prohibits states from requiring proof of citizenship by declaring that mere “attestation” of citizenship on a voter registration form is enough. That’s ridiculous. It has also been demonstrated empirically to be false. In defending the Kansas law in court, I presented more than a hundred instances of aliens who had knowingly or unknowingly checked the box claiming to be citizens when registering to vote. Asking registrants to check a box declaring their citizenship is utterly ineffective in ensuring that only U.S. citizens are registered to vote.
And we have already seen elections that have likely been stolen by aliens voting. The infamous J.J. Rizzo v. Will Royster primary election for the Missouri legislature in 2010 is such a case. There, some 50 Somali nationals who were coached to vote for Rizzo tipped the election for him — he won by a margin of exactly one vote.
But even when illegal votes by aliens don’t change the outcome of an election, they do effectively disenfranchise U.S. citizens. Every time an alien votes, it cancels out the vote of a citizen. If H.R. 1 were to become law, this sort of disenfranchisement would become even more widespread.
Voting is the most precious right of citizenship. Yet many on the Left are willing to give it away to non-citizens. The Democrat stronghold of San Francisco now allows aliens to vote in school board elections. During the deliberation on H.R. 1, Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) offered a motion to recommit which would have expressed the sense of Congress that “allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.” The motion would have sent the bill back to committee for such language to be added by amendment. All but six House Democrats voted against the motion, killing it.
Enabling people to easily vote at multiple addresses. H.R. 1 also makes it easy for fraudsters to vote multiple times at multiple polling places. Now, most states use provisional ballots to deal with the fact that voters sometimes change their residence but forget to change their registration address. You get to vote at the polling place near your new residence, but you use a provisional ballot. This allows the election officials to verify in the days after the election that your new address is indeed correct and that you didn’t also vote at your old address. Your vote is then added to the official tally.
But, inexplicably, that’s not good enough for the authors of H.R. 1. The bill would compel election officials across America to allow any voter to walk into any polling place and assert that he now lives at a new address in that district — and then be given a regular ballot, not a provisional one. At that point, the voter’s ballot is cast and then intermingled with the other ballots. If it were later discovered that the person lied and does not live in the district, it would be too late to do anything about it.
Even worse, the fraudster could do it all day long, going into separate polling places and declaring a new address each time. Election officials might eventually discover the crime, but the damage would already be done; and the fraudulent votes could not be removed from the totals.
Dumping duplicate names and bad data into state election databases. Voter roll databases are difficult enough to keep accurate as it is. Every year millions of Americans change addresses or die. For example, the Pew Center on the States studied this problem in 2012 and found that there were over 1.8 million deceased individuals on voter rolls across the country. The number of people who are registered in multiple states was even higher — approximately 2.75 million. In total, approximately 24 million voter records (or one out of eight) were invalid or significantly inaccurate.
H.R. 1 would make this problem much worse. It forces states to dump data from their various government databases, as well as from federal databases, into the voter rolls in order to “automatically” register voters. The problem is that most of those databases are even less accurate than the voter rolls are. The addition of this garbage data into the states’ voter rolls would create millions more duplicate and inaccurate names on the voter rolls, each of which would present an opportunity for individuals to commit voter fraud.
Usurping the constitutional role of the states. The United States Constitution gives the states primary responsibility for determining the “time, place, and manner” of elections in Article I, Section 4. Congress is allowed to modify those rules regarding the time, place, and manner of federal elections. However, Article I, Section 2, affirms that the states have sole authority to determine the qualifications for voting in each state, and by extension the qualifications for becoming registered to vote.
The authors of H.R. 1 evidently are not familiar with that part of the Constitution. Nor are those representatives who voted for it. If H.R. 1 ever became law, it would eviscerate Article I, Section 2. It would replace state rules for determining who is a qualified voter with a one-size-fits-all federal system. The bill even gets into the minutia of determining the content of state mailings to voters and the content of state election websites.
These are only a few of the many flaws in H.R. 1. For the sake of brevity, I will end the list here.
Fortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that the Senate will not advance the bill; and President Trump has made clear that he would veto it if it came to his desk. But beware: This invitation for voter fraud will likely be offered again when Democrats next control the Senate.
Kris W. Kobach served as the Secretary of State of Kansas 2011–2019. In that capacity he authored Kansas’s Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act of 2011. An expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the Arizona SB-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the ten ICE agents who sued to stop Obama’s 2012 DACA executive amnesty. During 2001–2003, he served as U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft’s chief adviser on immigration and border security at the U.S. Department of Justice. His website is kriskobach.com.

Space station dodges junk from old satellite (Update)
October 27, 2014 by Marcia Dunn
The International Space Station sidestepped a piece of treacherous junk Monday just hours before the planned launch of a supply ship from Virginia.
NASA said debris from an old, wrecked Russian satellite would have come dangerously close to the orbiting lab if not for the move.
The space station was maneuvered well out of harm's way to keep the outpost and its six inhabitants safe.
Mission Control was informed of the space junk over the weekend. It is wreckage from a Kosmos satellite that was launched in 1993 and collided with an Iridium spacecraft in 2009.
Mission Control said the space station's relocation would not affect Monday evening's scheduled launch of a commercial supply ship.
Orbital Sciences Corp.'s unmanned Cygnus capsule holds 5,000 pounds (2,267 kilograms) of cargo for NASA, including 32 mini research satellites, a meteor tracker, and a tank of high-pressure nitrogen to replenish a vestibule used by spacewalking astronauts. Liftoff was scheduled for 6:45 p.m. from Wallops Island, Virginia.
The launch, coming a half-hour after sunset, should be visible along much of the Eastern Seaboard, from South Carolina to Connecticut and Massachusetts. As an added bonus, the space station was to pass overhead five minutes later, resembling a fast-moving star.
Traffic is heavy these days 260 miles (418 kilometers) up.
Just this past Saturday, a Dragon cargo ship supplied by the California-based SpaceX company—its fifth—departed the space station after a monthlong visit and splashed into the Pacific with a load of precious science samples.
On Wednesday, a Russian cargo ship is set to rocket into orbit from Kazakhstan and arrive at the space station the same day.
The Cygnus—named after the swan constellation—would arrive Sunday and remain at the station until early December. It is not designed to return safely like the Dragon, but rather will be filled with trash and burn up in the atmosphere.
"Given all the traffic that's coming and going ... we might want to send up some of those red and green wands they use on the deck of an aircraft carrier," said Orbital Sciences' executive vice president Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who lived on the space station more than a decade ago.
This is the fourth space station delivery for the Virginia-based Orbital Sciences. Each one honors a deceased person linked to the company or commercial spaceflight; this one pays tribute to Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton, who led a rocket company until his death in 1993.
Orbital Sciences tucked in some treats for a post-Halloween celebration by the two Americans, three Russians and one German on board. Culbertson did not want to divulge the type of goodies and spoil the surprise. "They might be watching" he said, smiling, at Sunday's prelaunch news conference.
NASA is paying Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to make regular space station deliveries.

Hackers say they're revealing more from trove of NSA data
October 31, 2016
A group calling itself "Shadow Brokers" says it's releasing another tranche of information from its trove of top secret hacking data stolen from the U.S.'s National Security Agency.
Shadow Brokers has been closely followed by intelligence watchers and cybersecurity specialists since the group released a set of NSA hacking tools into the wild in August, purportedly the opening act in an implausible money-raising stunt.
The Intercept, an investigative publication with access to NSA material leaked by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, confirmed Shadow Brokers' tools were real by cross-referencing the leaked data with information held in a previously unpublished top secret manual.
The authenticity of the latest batch of material could not immediately be established. The Shadow Brokers did not return messages seeking comment Monday. The NSA declined to comment.

Enzyme helps bacteria defend themselves against oxidants secreted by immune system

Enzyme helps bacteria defend themselves against oxidants secreted by immune system
March 21, 2017, FAPESP
A research project conducted at the University of São Paulo (USP) in Brazil in collaboration with other Brazilian research institutions and abroad has revealed new aspects of the action mechanism of organic hydroperoxide resistance (Ohr) enzyme, which enables several species of bacteria to neutralize oxidizing substances released by the defense system of the host organism, be it a plant or an animal.
According to the researchers, the resulting knowledge could be the basis for novel therapeutic approaches.
"There are known proteins with a structure similar to Ohr's in plants and animals. That suggests it's possible to inhibit the enzyme in bacteria without causing significant harm to the infected organism, making it an interesting target for drug development," said Luis Eduardo Soares Netto, a professor at the University of São Paulo's Bioscience Institute (IB-USP) and the principal investigator for the study.
However, he stressed that more research is required to produce data relating the presence of Ohr to pathogen virulence.
Linked to the Center for Research on Redox Processes in Biomedicine (Redoxoma), one of the Research, Innovation and Dissemination Centers (RIDCs) funded by FAPESP, Netto's team performed several experiments, often using pathogens, to understand how Ohr participates in bacterial anti-oxidant defense.
"When we started the research project, we knew Ohr had an anti-oxidant function but knew nothing about the physiological substrates for this enzyme," Netto said. "We show in the study that it most effectively neutralizes peroxides, especially long-chain fatty acid hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite."
To reach this conclusion, the researchers initially performed molecular docking tests in computer simulations that showed how the possible substrates docked in the Ohr active site. These analyses pointed to significant structural complementarity between Ohr and different types of fatty acid hydroperoxides, such as those derived from arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, which act as mediators of inflammatory processes in mammals and plants, respectively.
This first finding was validated in in vitro biochemical assays with Ohr produced by Xylella fastidiosa, the bacterium that causes citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC), a serious disease of sweet oranges and other citrus species. As Netto explained, this research followed from the X. fastidiosa whole-genome sequencing project completed in the 1990s with FAPESP's support.
The in vitro tests consisted of incubating purified Ohr with various types of hydroperoxide. The aim was to measure the time taken by the enzyme to convert each of these oxidants into less toxic substances.
"We observed, for example, that [Ohr] was able to neutralize hydrogen peroxide but that the process was 100,000 times slower than in the case of arachidonic acid hydroperoxide," Netto said.
The chemical reaction occurred in milliseconds when the enzyme was incubated with fatty acid hydroperoxides, but with other types of hydroperoxide, it took minutes, he explained.
The researchers were surprised to find Ohr acting just as efficiently in contact with peroxynitrite as it did with hydroperoxides derived from arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, given that this was not predicted by the computer simulations.
"Peroxynitrite is the product of two other radicals: superoxide and nitric oxide. It's released by both plants and mammals in response to infection by pathogens," Netto explained.
The next step consisted of microbiological assays using lineages of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes opportunistic infections in the respiratory system and elsewhere in humans.
"We compared a group of mutant bacteria, in which the Ohr gene had been deleted, with wild bacteria that produced the enzyme," Netto said. "Both groups were placed in different hydroperoxide concentrations to test their resistance."
The wild bacteria grew even in high hydroperoxide concentrations, while the mutant lineages stopped multiplying even in low concentrations. However, when the Ohr gene was reinserted into the mutant bacteria, their resistance to the oxidant was comparable to that of the wild bacteria.
According to Netto, during their evolution, bacteria developed a vast repertoire of anti-oxidant proteins to circumvent host organisms' defenses.
The tests performed by Netto's group showed that other mutant bacteria, in which the genes for these anti-oxidant enzymes had been deleted, were not as sensitive to fatty acid hydroperoxide and peroxynitrite as the mutant lineage without Ohr. According to Netto, this suggests that Ohr plays a central role in bacterial anti-oxidant defense.

Supreme Court sympathetic to Microsoft in Xbox owners' suit (Update)

The Supreme Court suggested Tuesday that it is sympathetic to Microsoft Corp. in a dispute with disgruntled owners of the Xbox 360 video-game system who sued saying the console has a design defect that scratches game discs.
The justices heard arguments Tuesday in a case that involves the Xbox 360 owners' attempts to get class action status for their lawsuit, which was filed several years ago in the state of Washington, where Microsoft is headquartered.
Xbox 360 owners were denied class action status in the lawsuit. Several justices seemed sympathetic to Microsoft's argument that the Xbox 360 owners shouldn't be permitted to use a procedural maneuver to force an appeals court to weigh in after the appeals court declined to do so. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the attorney for the Xbox 360 owners, Peter Stris, that a lot of work had gone in to the rule governing appeals in class action cases and suggested he was making an end run around it.
Microsoft has sold millions of Xbox 360 consoles since they were introduced in 2005. It says only 0.4 percent of owners report disk scratching and that in many cases damage is the result of consumer misuse. The company says consumers were warned both in the instruction manual and on a sticker affixed to the console not to move it while a disc was inside.
When a handful of Xbox 360 owners sued, a federal judge initially said the lawsuit couldn't proceed as a class action, reasoning that the actions of each user were different, and an appeals court declined to hear an appeal. But after the Xbox owners asked the judge to dismiss their case in order to get the appeals court to hear the dispute, the appeals court weighed in. Microsoft says that shouldn't be allowed to happen.
Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have urged the court to side with Microsoft. In briefs to the court they say a ruling for the Xbox 360 owners gives those who file questionable class action lawsuits another chance to pursue class action status if they fail to get it at an early stage of the litigation. Businesses say that would make defending against class action lawsuits more expensive and push businesses to settle claims.

Then what does? I am 70 and my son and I have both had xbox 360s(several) that did the same thing. It was not a uncommon thing to have happen. What they don't mention here is that the xbox's DVD player was keyed to only the xbox that it was sold with. That way you could not fix it even at your own expense.

Scientists 'excited' by observations suggesting formation scenarios
August 23, 2017, University of Birmingham
This artist's concept depicts a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. The blue color here represents radiation pouring out from material very close to the black hole. The grayish structure surrounding the black hole, called a torus, is made up of gas and dust. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech
Physicists have described how observations of gravitational waves limit the possible explanations for the formation of black holes outside of our galaxy; either they are spinning more slowly than black holes in our own galaxy or they spin rapidly but are 'tumbled around' with spins randomly oriented to their orbit.
The paper, published in Nature, is based on data that came about following landmark observations of gravitational waves by the LIGO gravitational wave detector in 2015 and again in 2017.
In our own galaxy we have been able to electromagnetically observe black holes orbited by stars and map their behaviour - notably their rapid spinning.
Gravitational waves carry information about the dramatic origins of black that cannot otherwise be obtained. Physicists concluded that the first detected gravitational waves, in September 2015, were produced during the final fraction of a second of the merger of two black holes to produce a single, more massive spinning black hole. Collisions of two black holes had been predicted, but never observed.
As such, gravitational waves present the best and only way to get a deep look at the population of stellar-mass binary black holes beyond our galaxy. This paper states that the black holes seen via gravitational waves are different to those previously seen in our galaxy in one of two possible ways.
The first possibility is that the black holes are spinning slowly. If that is the case it suggests that something different is happening to the stars that form these black holes than those observed in our galaxy.
The second possibility is that the black holes are spinning rapidly, much like those in our galaxy, but have been 'tumbled' during formation and are therefore no longer aligned with orbit. If this is the case, it would mean that the black holes are living in a dense environment - most likely within star clusters. That would make for a considerably more dynamic formation.
There is, however, also the chance that both possibilities are true - that there are instances of black holes spinning slowly in the field and instances of black holes spinning rapidly in a dense environment.
Dr Will Farr, from the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Birmingham, explained, "By presenting these two explanations for the observed behaviour, and ruling out other scenarios, we are providing those who study and try to explain the formation of black holes a target to hit. In our field, knowing the question to ask is almost as important as getting the answer itself."
Professor Ilya Mandel, also from the University of Birmingham, added "We will know which explanation is right within the next few years. This is something that has only been made possible by the LIGO detections of gravitational waves in the last couple of years. This field is in its infancy; I'm confident that in the near future we will look back on these first few detections and rudimentary models with nostalgia and a much better understanding of how these exotic binary systems form."
The team was led by researchers from the University of Birmingham in the UK alongside the University of Maryland, University of Chicago and Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in the US.

Amazing that something that used to be so theoretical is now confirmed beyond any doubt. Shame that Hoyle wasn't alive to see it. Don't think he'd have been too impressed, but, as a good scientist, he'd have seen something confirmed in the scientific way. And you can't do better than that. Eh?

Antibiotic-resistant infections in pets
October 4, 2017 by Diana Yates, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
Veterinary clinical medicine professor Dr. Jason Pieper, a veterinary dermatologist, sees patients with antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections nearly every day on the job. Credit: L. Brian Stauffer
Nearly every day on the job, veterinary clinical medicine professor Dr. Jason Pieper, a veterinary dermatologist, sees antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in cats, dogs and other pets. This is not just a local phenomenon; nationally, rates of antibiotic-resistant infections in companion animals are rising at an alarming rate. Pieper spoke to News Bureau life sciences editor Diana Yates about what he sees and what can be done about it.
How often do you see antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in your patients at the Small Animal Clinic in Urbana?
Yesterday, we had three animal patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, a type of bacteria that colonizes the skin of dogs and cats. Today, we have one. If you averaged it out over time, every day in the clinic we're seeing about one case of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius.
There also are other types of antibiotic-resistant infections in pets. A difficult one that we commonly deal with is Pseudomonas ear infections. Antibiotic-resistant E. coli, Enterococcus species and salmonella also have been identified with an increased prevalence in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. Some of these bacteria may be causing infection in the animals, while others may just be present with no problems noted.
Do we know how widespread such infections are in animals nationally? Globally?
Since the original identification of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus as a rapidly emerging pathogen in 1999, it has increased in significance worldwide. Reports on the true prevalence vary. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus infection in animals has a reported prevalence of up to 40 percent in North America, 20 percent in Europe, 48 percent in China and 12 percent in Australia.
How does this compare with antibiotic-resistant infections in human populations?
Currently, about 25 percent of human Staphylococcus aureus infections are methicillin-resistant. This has decreased by about 50 percent in recent years, but still affects more than 80,000 people per year.
What do you think is contributing to the problem in pets?
I think a big problem is people giving antibiotics to animals when it's not indicated, when it's not necessary. If your patient is going into surgery and there's a huge risk, then it's prudent to give antibiotics. But in other circumstances, it's better not to.
I take skin biopsies all the time and in my seven years of doing them, I never give antibiotics unless there's infection prior to my taking a sample. I have yet to have a biopsy site come back infected. I think a lot of people who take biopsies always give antibiotics, no matter what. Those practices need to change, to decrease the chance of resistance.
Studies have shown that giving animals antibiotics for only a week or two can induce antibiotic resistance. When we decide to give antibiotics, we do so for no less than 21 days.
The other issue is that veterinarians are giving their patients more powerful antibiotics than are appropriate. Some of the more potent or broader-spectrum antibiotics induce mutations in the bacteria that spur resistance and cause more problems.
How do you treat antibiotic-resistant infections?
In some cases, we do use the "big gun" antibiotics, which are less than ideal for reasons already mentioned and because they can damage the liver and kidneys. I'm dealing with one dog that has a liver issue right now from an antibiotic I used because its infection was not responding to other treatments, including antibiotics. I had cultured the wound and tested the bacteria's sensitivity to the drug before determining which antibiotic to use.
A different approach is to use extremely aggressive topical antiseptics that are applied during bathing or as sprays, mousses or creams. These have to be applied to the affected areas up to two or three times a day, and sometimes help clear up infections without having to resort to using antibiotics.
Are any of these infections a threat to human health?
There is always a chance that methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius could infect humans, but the chances are very low. S. aureus tends to live on humans and infect humans, while S. pseudintermedius tends to live on and infect dogs and cats. There are always outliers and rare instances when bacteria cross over to another species. S. pseudintermedius typically infects humans when they are immunosuppressed or bitten by a dog or cat, since the mouth is a common site for the bacteria.
What can be done about this problem?
We have decreased the incidence of methicillin-resistant bacterial infections in people largely by using antibiotics more responsibly. I remember a time when I would always be prescribed antibiotics for the flu. Now, physicians are not prescribing antibiotics for viral infections, which don't respond to antibiotics.
I feel the veterinary community needs to take a lesson from this and also start practicing the responsible use of antibiotics. If an animal's skin is inflamed, test the site to determine whether antibiotics are needed. I see way too many cases where such tests are not performed and the doctors give out antibiotics no matter what. This is perpetuating the problem.
At the same time, all pet owners should question veterinarians whenever they prescribe antibiotics without first confirming a bacterial infection.

Diversifying tech: Black professionals are finding success in spite of the odds
February 18, 2019 by Dalvin Brown, Usa Today
Tech is an industry that's known for moving fast.
Companies can go from zero to millions, even billions in little time. Products seem to be perpetually evolving and apps literally update overnight.
Still, there is one area where the sector has seen very little movement—diversity.
The latest diversity reports from Twitter, Google and Facebook say that less than 5 percent of the companies' tech workers identify as black. In Silicon Valley as a whole, blacks and Hispanics make up between 3 percent and 6 percent of workers, and women of color are 1 percent or less.
There are various reasons why the racial imbalance in tech continues to exist, including negative stereotypes, insular networks and roadblocks to getting venture capital. And studies suggest that black people in the industry are especially concerned.
In fact, 84 percent of blacks employed in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) professions place a high level of importance on workplace diversity, according to 2018 Pew Research data, compared with 49 percent of whites.
59 percent of Hispanics and 64 percent of Asians said they thought racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace is extremely or very important.
Despite the challenges, there's a long list of people who are working to change the industry's outlook as more black people move into prominent roles in technology companies, develop products and found their own companies.
"My whole experience in the industry over the past 10 years has created this desire to create solutions to these problems," said Jewel Burks Solomon who is black. She co-founded visual-recognition tech startup Partpic in 2013 and sold it to Amazon for an undisclosed sum in 2016.
"There is a lot of promise in the industry for the playing field to be leveled. That's why I dedicate a lot of my time to give other people a chance to thrive," Burks Solomon said.
Since selling her company to Amazon, Burks Solomon has invested in seven black-owned businesses and has partnered with three other black entrepreneurs to launch a project called Collab, an investment firm that connects black business owners to investors, resources, and partners.
About half of STEM workers believe limited access to quality education is one of the major reasons why blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in STEM jobs, according to Pew Research.
Kimberly Bryant, the founder of Black Girls Code (BGC), works to introduce a strong pipeline of academically excellent girls of color to computer science.
Since its launch in 2011, BGC has introduced more than 8,000 girls to computer science with 13 chapters in the U.S. and one international chapter in Johannesburg. By 2040, Bryant wants to reach 1 million girls.
"We want to see companies making a good faith effort and putting some tangible initiatives behind their pledge for diversity," Bryant told USA TODAY in 2018.
Still, there is a wide range of black professionals like Burks Solomon and Bryant who have found success in spite of the odds. Many hold the tech industry accountable for its low number of minority professionals.
Take Erica Joy Baker, for example, who serves as the principal group engineering manager at Microsoft. Baker has called out the tech industry on Twitter for years for narrowly focusing its diversity efforts.
She also rallied her colleagues to create a spreadsheet of their salaries which she says exposed some inequity issues when she worked at Google.
"I see as my duty to hold companies accountable until stuff gets better," Baker told USA Today in 2016 when she worked as a senior engineer at Slack. "I am trying to keep moving the needle, to make sure the stuff that we didn't talk about, the stuff that gets brushed under the rug, gets discussed and gets solved."

RECIPE: Grilled Halibut with Peach and Pepper Salsa
A fresh fruit salsa is a lovely accompaniment to grilled fish in the summer; try it also with striped bass or arctic char. Here, the season’s juiciest peaches pair with fiery habanero pepper for a sweet-spicy flavor. Leave the peaches unpeeled for more color and texture.
INGREDIENTS
SALSA:
1 1/3 cups coarsely chopped peeled yellow peaches (about 1 pound)
1 cup chopped red bell pepper (about 1 medium)
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions
1/3 cup chopped fresh arugula
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
4 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 habanero pepper, seeded and minced
1 garlic clove, minced
FISH:
4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
4 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 garlic clove, minced
4 (6-ounce) skinless halibut fillets
3/8 teaspoon salt
3/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Cooking spray
Preparation
1. To prepare salsa, combine first 9 ingredients; toss gently. Let stand 30 minutes before serving.
2. Prepare grill to medium-high heat.
3. To prepare fish, combine 4 teaspoons juice, oil, paprika, and 1 garlic clove in a large, shallow glass baking dish, stirring with a whisk. Add fish to juice mixture; turn to coat. Cover and let stand 15 minutes.
4. Remove fish from marinade; discard marinade. Sprinkle fish evenly with 3/8 teaspoon salt and black pepper. Place fish on a grill rack coated with cooking spray; grill 3 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Serve fish with salsa.

Metamorphosis - Not Exactly Rocket Science moves to Discover Blogs

By edyong on March 26, 2010.
I've been teasing a big announcement for a couple of days now, and after a technical delay, here it is - the death of Not Exactly Rocket Science.
And the birth of Not Exactly Rocket Science ;-)
After two brilliant years at ScienceBlogs, I'm evolving, migrating, metastasising, metamorphosing, (retro)transposing and otherwise moving to a new home at Discover Blogs (as one clever commenter correctly guessed yesterday). My inaugural post is now up.
Being part of this collective has been an amazing experience and I'm incredibly grateful to the crew at ScienceBlogs, and specifically Virginia Hughes, Erin Johnson and Arikia Millikan, for pushing my writing out to a wide audience without ever trying to nudge its direction. Special thanks also to my Scibling friends - there are too many of you to list here but you know who you are and we will undoubtedly keep in touch on Twitter and so on.
It wasn't easy deciding to move to uncharted territory but I'm incredibly excited about joining my esteemed blogging chums Carl Zimmer and Sheril Kirshenbaum (who've already extended the warmest of welcomes), as well as Razib (he's moved too!), Phil Plait, Sean Carroll, Chris Mooney, Andrew Moseman, Smriti Rao, and others. I've been impressed with the stable of writers that Discover have amalgamated and I'm honoured to join their ranks.
I sincerely hope that those of you who currently read my daily musings will follow me to my new abode. I may be relocating but the menu's still the same. Comments will be closed on this iteration of Not Exactly Rocket Science but all the old posts have moved across, so feel free to continue the discussions there.
So, effective immediately, I will be living at http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/ and the new feed is http://feeds.feedburner.com/notrocketscience. I'll see you over there. In the meantime, please update your feed, bookmarks, links, blogrolls and so on. If you cared to spread the word about the new site to friends, family and colleagues, I would greatly appreciate it.
Up, up and away.

do you know that half of the written responses on the SBAC will never see a human scorer? And there’s no evidence for the validity or efficacy of machine scoring? see
http://www.studentprivacymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Machine-scoring-brief-4.5.16-1.pdf
please send a letter to your state commissioner today, asking him whether the SBAC for your child will be scored by a human or a machine:

Jerry Jones doesn’t really care about the national anthem and is a hypocrite. Sean Hannity passes the nightly torch to Laura and puts his foot in his mouth. A huge defense spending bill gets signed by Donald J. Trump into law. No slippery slope when it comes to PayPal & Stripe accepting money from white nationalists. Twitter is happy to court Conservatives after supposedly silencing them. A Kentucky Republican mayor is charged with a hit & run. Melissa Howard admits she lied about her diploma will continue to run for her seat as a Republican. The countries that Donald J. Trump doesn’t know.

No Pain, No Gain – Chronic Illness and the Christian Church
“Because of the extravagance of those revelations, and so I wouldn’t get a big head, I was given the gift of a handicap to keep me in constant touch with my limitations. Satan’s angel did his best to get me down; what he in fact did was push me to my knees. No danger then of walking around high and mighty! At first I didn’t think of it as a gift, and begged God to remove it. Three times I did that, and then he told me,
My grace is enough; it’s all you need.
My strength comes into its own in your weakness.
Once I heard that, I was glad to let it happen. I quit focusing on the handicap and began appreciating the gift. It was a case of Christ’s strength moving in on my weakness. Now I take limitations in stride, and with good cheer, these limitations that cut me down to size—abuse, accidents, opposition, bad breaks. I just let Christ take over! And so the weaker I get, the stronger I become.”
2 Corinthians 12:7 (The Message)
As I write this, I have the flu. I think I am on day six of it. Every once in a while, I get up to get water or crackers and notice that the sun has made an entire rotation around the earth since the last trip to get water and crackers. And one week prior to getting sick with the flu, I had a freak allergic reaction and infection from a spider bite. And three times previous to that in the past month, I have had debilitating migraines. I have a lot of horrible migraines, for which there are harbingers of auras, sensitivity to sound, and numbness of my face (always disconcerting, that one.)
I get sick a lot. My immune system is not terribly strong, and I have a lot of pain and inflammation issues. If you saw me, you might see a healthy middle-aged person, a little fluffy and dented, but well. Illnesses don’t always show on the outside. Oftentimes, the erosion is on the inside, where you cannot see.
Some of my dear friends also suffer from ‘invisible illnesses’ – ranging from bi-polar to nerve diseases, diabetes to chronic fatigue. They are health issues that are chronic – meaning more or less constant. Many of them are followers of Jesus Christ, such as myself. Chronic illness reminds me of alcoholism, in that I seemed to serendipitously end up as a member of a club I didn’t choose to join.
I do, however, get to choose my membership in the body of Christ, which needs to better deal with some of the realities on this planet – chronic illness being one. I am not the only Christian who has felt awkward about her health problems in the Church proper (not my particular church, which kind of ‘gets it’ on the level … but the church in general.)
Many in the Christian community don’t really know what to do with chronic illness – of that I am convinced.
I believe in miracles all day long. I believe that signs and wonders abound every single day. Nothing is impossible for God – nothing! He can rearrange every cell in my body to work in perfect alignment. He does it for people all the time. Knowing that can make it especially frustrating to suffer.
But the reality of the matter is that some of us will not get the healing we imagine this side of the Kingdom. People suffer in innumerable ways all of the time, and die from disease every day. That’s the reality.
Our bodies are indeed the Temple of the Holy Spirit, but I don’t for a minute believe that God only takes up residence in the Taj Mahals among us. Jesus was not put off by hanging out where there was great pain and suffering – in the alleyways. In bodies like ours.
He can heal me, and one day he will. Until that day, one question usurps the pain, the fatigue.
“Do you trust me?”
Do I trust Him even in the debilitation and pain?
Either I believe that all things work to the good or I don’t. Either I know that His grace is sufficient, or I don’t. On especially painful days, it’s harder to come to terms with that. If Jesus was not spared pain, why do we imagine we deserve to be spared the experience?
Sometimes we do not get healing that the world recognizes as whole. When Christians insist that you become healed in a specific way on an ongoing basis, a number of things happen to the sufferer, the church, and most awkwardly, the world as it observes us.
And this makes us all uncomfortable. Let’s bring this thorny issue into the light where we can deal with it.
The sick believer isn’t believing/praying/wanting wellness enough
Let’s be honest. After your friends have prayed for the same healing for you over a period of months or years, you might start to believe that you are just a dud. I know I have felt like a dud many, many times. The whole “believe harder” angle is so damaging, because it places the miracle out of God the bestower, into you the believer. And nothing we do or do not do causes the heavens to release power. It is all in Christ Jesus that we receive. It is our job to receive what is released – and when you are suffering, accepting and receiving can seem a whole lot harder than turning water into wine.
The sufferer feels embarrassed/ashamed that they have not been restored in the way they’ve prayed.
It’s no fun being run down or in pain. It sucks, badly. If you are healthy on a regular basis, praise God! Please don’t tell sick people, “Wow, you are sick again?” or “I never get sick.” I think I speak for chronic illness sufferers everywhere in saying those comments are not at all helpful. Ultimately, we end up lying to those around us who ask “So how are you feeling?” with the f-word. “Fine.” After all, who wants to hear the same story over and over? It feels shameful, but it shouldn’t. If we cannot be transparent in the church, where is it safe to do so?
If I don’t get healthy, my witness is damaged
This is a pretty persuasive lie, because it makes common sense. Who wants a piece of what I’ve got, if I’m sickly? Over and over again it has been confirmed to my spirit that the world needs to see faith in imperfect lives. Because all of our lives are imperfect, and nobody can relate to perfection. You are going through what you are going through, that is your reality.
“If it hasn’t happened by now, it isn’t happening” is never true
I will never stop asking for healing. I will never stop interceding for my friends who are dealing with chronic illnesses. As chronic as these conditions are, they are ultimately temporal. And God wastes not one single hurt I go through. He can use it all, and He can take it all away. What the devil means to use for destruction, our Father can easily use as a means to love. That’s a fact.
God is not punishing us
God is love in its purest form. He is not sadistic. He hurts that you hurt. His plans are much bigger than the pain. That is the foundation of my survival, because it is truth.
You don’t need to ‘get well’ so that ‘God can use you’
What kind of propaganda is that? Stop saying that, church!
If I am supposed to do a thing, but I cannot because I am sick, then I am not supposed to do the thing. My illness is not keeping God from doing HIS thing, which is the main thing. He equips me, and He knows my innermost being and what it is capable of. That’s the thing about it.
Run the race He has set before you. You are not responsible for running the courses set for others.
Jesus is not afraid of catching my ick
Although migraines are not contagious, it is easy to fall into thinking He is staying far away. But he is present in the pain, He doesn’t run from us when we are in the valleys.
I think about the paralyzed man who was healed by Jesus in a common setting – the one who was told to pick up his mat and walk. This is so easy for God to do – to enable that! Why would he not allow us all to pick up our mats? Why are some of us barely dragging our mats behind us? I cannot begin to understand.
I’m inclined to believe it has to do with the Bigger Picture. For the sake of the whole purpose have had life breathed into these bodies – so that someone else can be blessed by hearing “I know what you are going through, you are not alone.” If suffering comes at the price of one other person knowing that God is to be trusted even through the circumstance of pain, it is somehow more tolerable.
Until I get my full healing, I’ll tell you what Jesus does for me – He gets down on the mat with me and loves me to pieces. That’s what I think the church should do. Pray, always! But also bend down to the hurting people where they are – and love them to pieces in the midst.
We don’t always get restored the way we want, but we always have comfort available to us.
We should stop selling Christianity in a slick package that promises a specific healing
Guess what? People see other people get prayed for that still suffer and die all the time. It’s the circle of life thing. Christianity is so much more than surface healing – so much deeper than tissue and brain matter and physical vitality. It is relationship with the Creator….. SO much MORE. And so much better.
Never stop praying in the Spirit. But get down on the mat and love people where they are.
I know for a fact that other people have gone through pain before me, so that they could impart that same message to me. So, in a way, I am grateful for the pain of others.I am glad I can pay that forward. When I have a finite amount of energy every day, and I can either use it to raise my fist to shake it at God – because I don’t understand this! Or, I can raise it to praise Him. I am about 50/50 with the fist shaking and worship through the pain at this point. But I’m getting better at the latter.
Love the sinner, hate the sin. Love the sufferer, hate the pain. Jesus does.
Come to me, all you chronic pain sufferers, and I will give you rest.
Come to me all you whose minds are tortured with mental illness, and I will give you a soft place to fall.
Come to me, all you exhausted souls, and I will give you my Shalom.
Not a single other human being on this planet might know how much you are hurting, what your body and mind are going through. But God does. Make room on your mat for Him until you can get up and run that marathon.
Are you weak and sick? Then you are strong!
… It was a case of Christ’s strength moving in on my weakness.
God Himself inhabits our puny, struggling flesh as if it were the most beautiful temple in all the land. Because it is.
Rest in Him.

I have severe arthritis (degenerative joint disease). Before I was 40, I was told I already had 80 yr old knees and both had to be replaced. So they were. But the degeneration continues throughout my joints. And people ALWAYS ask if I was an athlete and think that must be why I’ve had bilateral knee replacements. I get the same look every time I say no I just have bad joints, that one that contains pity but also says I am defective. And with the disease comes chronic pain and with the chronic pain comes depression. But I know God still loves me and he hears my prayers just as he does for a healthy person. And I believe God led me to find this blog at a time when I felt so alone and isolated. So those of us who suffer on the inside know that God watches over us with special love and we therefore have a special grace. Prayers for you and your health Jana. Your writing brings God, solace and comfort to many. P.S. sorry for the extra long comment :).

Bless you bless you bless you for that message — so many are hung on on expecting (demanding?) material blessings and healing in this lifetime. God is good, and He is sovereign; if we hold on to both of those truths, we may come to grips with the fact that we may never understand His purposes, but we can still trust them. Sometimes He chooses to provide miracles — perhaps as a foretaste of what’s to come, but there will always be suffering in this world. Some of it makes us better and some of it just is.
One minor point — you said “God is not punishing us” — I agree that every time we suffer we should not think that it means God is punishing us, and there are people who needlessly agonize over what they must have done to deserve their suffering. Also, sin usually comes with it’s own built in punishment (“consequences”). Still, sometimes on occasion, He does punish us.

Brextension: UK lawmakers vote to seek delay of EU departure
published on March 14, 2019 - 12:42 PM
Written by DANICA KIRKA Associated Press, JILL LAWLESS
Share this:
(AP) — Britain’s Parliament voted Thursday to seek a delay of the country’s departure from the European Union, a move that will likely avert a chaotic withdrawal on the scheduled exit date of March 29.
With Brexit due in 15 days and no divorce deal yet approved, the House of Commons voted 412-202 to ask the bloc to postpone Britain’s exit until at least June 30.
Power to approve or reject the extension lies with the EU, whose officials have said they will only allow a delay if Britain either approves a divorce deal or makes a fundamental shift in its approach to Brexit. In a historic irony, almost three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, its future is now in the bloc’s hands.
By law, Britain will leave the EU on March 29, with or without a deal, unless it cancels Brexit or secures a delay.
While the Parliament vote gives Prime Minister Theresa May some breathing space, it was still humbling for a leader who has spent two years telling Britons they were leaving the bloc on that date.
Lawmakers have twice rejected her EU divorce deal — and also ruled out leaving the EU without an agreement. Withdrawing without a deal could mean major disruptions for businesses and people in the U.K. and the 27 remaining countries.
But there was some good news for May, as lawmakers rejected an attempt to strip her of control over Brexit. They defeated by the narrowest of margins an opposition attempt let Parliament choose an alternative to May’s rejected divorce deal and force the government to negotiate it with the EU.
The House of Commons defeated the idea by just two votes, 314-312, leaving May least temporarily in charge of the Brexit agenda.
Lawmakers also voted to rule out the idea of holding a second Brexit referendum — at least for now.
By a decisive 334-85 vote, they defeated a motion that called for another vote by the public on whether to stay in the EU or leave. Campaigners for a new referendum are divided over whether the time is right to push for a second Brexit vote. The vote didn’t prevent lawmakers from trying again later to get Parliament’s support for another referendum.
Postponing Brexit gives May some respite, amid a crisis that has shredded her authority and obliterated her control of a fractious Conservative minority government. On Wednesday, a dozen government ministers abstained rather than support May’s bid to keep a no-deal Brexit as an option, while another voted against, and resigned.
Despite the rebuffs and the political chaos, May has signaled she will try a third time to get backing for her agreement next week. She is seeking to win over opponents in her own party and its Northern Irish political ally, the Democratic Unionist Party.
Alan Wager, a researcher at the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank, said May faced a struggle to overturn a 149-vote margin of defeat in Parliament this week.
“It’s still really difficult to see how the numbers stack up for Theresa May, but she’s giving it one more go,” he said.
If the delay is approved next week, May hopes to use it to enact legislation needed for Britain’s departure. She has warned Brexit supporters who oppose her deal that if no withdrawal agreement is passed in the coming days, the only option will be to seek a long extension that could mean Brexit never happens.
Bowing to pressure, the government said Thursday that if May’s deal is not approved by next week, Parliament will get votes on other options — including a closer relationship with the bloc than the government wants — to see if any can command a majority.
Any delay in the Brexit process would require the unanimous approval of all 27 remaining EU member states.
Officials and national leaders in the bloc are exasperated at the events in London. They have said they will approve an extension if there is a specific reason, but don’t want to provide more time for political bickering in Britain.
“Under no circumstances an extension in the dark!” tweeted the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt. “Unless there is a clear majority in the House of Commons for something precise, there is no reason at all for the European Council to agree on a prolongation.”
Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said the EU needed “more decisions” from London.
In another sting for the beleaguered May, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was “surprised at how badly” the Brexit negotiations have been handled.
Trump, who sees himself as a deal-maker, said he gave May advice but she didn’t listen to him.
Speaking alongside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the White House, Trump said Britain’s debate over leaving the EU was “tearing the country apart.”
The EU, meanwhile, is reluctant to postpone Brexit beyond the late May elections for the European Parliament, because that would mean Britain taking part even as it prepares to leave.
The bloc is more open to a long delay to allow Britain to radically change course — an idea favored by pro-EU British lawmakers who want to maintain close ties with the EU.
European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that he will appeal to EU leaders “to be open to a long extension if the U.K. finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus about it.”
Conservative lawmaker George Freeman suggested that May had been so damaged by Brexit that she should promise to quit to get her deal through.
“This chaos can’t continue,” Freeman said in a tweet. “Something has to give.”

UC Davis is located in Davis, California, and was first established in 1905, but first opened its doors in 1908. UC Davis was originally known for being a University Farm for UC Berkeley. Now in present day, UC Davis is known worldwide for its expertise in agriculture and veterinary medicine. It is one of the top ten schools in the UC school system.
In 1930, the campus was 1,000 acres and soon turned into 3,000 acres by 1951. Now in present day, the campus reached 5,000 acres by 2007. This school attracts high achieving students. Some of the requirements to be accepted into UC Davis is to have your SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) range from 1200-1420. Your ACT (American College Testing) range requirements to be accepted into this school need to be from 25-32. You also need to have an average GPA of 3.99. If you have these requirements and are interested in attending UC Davis, then the state tuition fees are $14,463. Out of state tuition fees are $43,458.
The school’s mission is to commit and provide a high quality education that will create a supportive and creative environment for students who attend the university. The school also strives for students to progress their problem-solving skills to improve their everyday lives.
UC Davis is known worldwide for its expertise in agriculture and veterinary medicine. It has been ranked #38 in National Universities and #24 in Best Undergraduate Teaching. Some schools on the campus that are available to applicants who plan on attending UC Davis are Graduate School of Management, School of Law, School of Medicine, College of Engineering, School of Veterinary Medicine, and School of Education.
When my sister, Patricia Jovel, was a young adult searching for a college to attend, she decided to apply for UC Davis. UC Davis caught her eye because she was particularly interested in UC Davis’ School of Veterinary Medicine, since she really wanted to become a veterinarian During her time at UC Davis, Patricia’s major was animal science and midway through college, she changed it to wildlife biology. Patricia describes the school, “It’s very green. It’s a nice little town and it’s a nice little college. You can walk basically everywhere.”
“Challenging but rewarding. Challenging part is just you have to use a lot of well common sense, but also learn how to problem solve. And you have to know like a lot of information. And then they’re rewarding because we get to help animals,” is how Patricia describes her professors. According to her, you can learn a lot that will help you for your future job and even for future references to anything. But did she regret going there? No, she didn’t. Why? “I don’t regret going there. I felt it was a good experience. I felt like the reason I wanted to go to UC Davis was of their vet school.”
So you see, if you want to go to a college that’s out of the city, is green, and offers an excellent education, then UC Davis may be just the school you’re looking for.

GOP Kansas state legislator: Medicaid expansion now 'foregone conclusion'
By Peter Sullivan - 11/08/18 12:29 PM EST
© Getty Images
A Republican state legislator in Kansas says that Medicaid expansion is now a “foregone conclusion” in the state following the election of Democratic governor-elect Laura Kelly on Tuesday.
“I think it’s a foregone conclusion that now that will probably go through,” GOP state Rep. Dan Hawkins, an opponent of Medicaid expansion and chairman of the House’s health committee, told The Wichita Eagle.
The momentum for Medicaid expansion in Kansas comes after Kelly's election Tuesday to the state's highest office. Her victory over Republican Kris Kobach marked a major win for Democrats.

Medicaid expansion already passed the GOP-run state legislature in 2017 but then-Gov. Sam Brownback (R) vetoed it.
As governor, Kelly would sign the bill to expand Medicaid to roughly 150,000 people in Kansas.
Wisconsin is another target for Democrats in expanding Medicaid, where Democrat Tony Evers defeated Republican incumbent Gov. Scott Walker in another victory for Democrats on Tuesday.
Medicaid expansion is coming to three more red states after ballot initiatives prevailed on Tuesday in Nebraska, Utah, and Idaho. That leaves 14 states that have decided not to expand the program.
The Medicaid expansion, part of ObamaCare, allows states to expand eligibility for the program for people up to 138 percent of the poverty line, which is about $35,000 for a family of four.
Some Republicans have objected, claiming that the program is too costly and provides coverage for “able-bodied” people.

Daily business briefing
Many of the world's liberal democracies are reckoning with majoritarian gripes against minority appeasement. But India's might be the most dramatic case, with a cacophony of Hindu nationalists hell-bent on taking even compliments as insults. Meanwhile, the voices of the country's vulnerable Muslim minority, which has a genuine cause for complaint given the fresh indignities it suffers daily, barely register on the national consciousness.
For the last two weeks, groups associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have been protesting Padmaavat, a quasi-historical Bollywood extravaganza that tells the story of Rajput King Rana Singh, whose wife, Padmaavati, becomes the obsession of the Muslim emperor Alauddin Khilji after he hears about her legendary beauty.
Loosely based on an epic poem by a 16th century Muslim Sufi poet, the movie's cinematic sophistication — it is shot in 3-D with absolutely breathtaking scenes of courtly pomp set in medieval India — contrasts sharply with its crude and cartoonish characters. The film isn't a clash between mere good and evil, but utmost perfection and complete depravity as embodied by Singh, the Hindu hero, and Khilji, the Muslim villain.
The Hindu Singh, with his buff bod and kohl-smeared eyes, is a paragon of Rajput virtue who treats women like queens (of which he has two), moves with grace, deals with matters of state with flawless judgment, conducts himself with decorum, and fights with valor and integrity. Twice he foregoes the opportunity to kill the unarmed Khilji because that would have meant violating the Rajput code of honor.
The Muslim Khilji, by contrast, is not just dastardly, but a savage lech. He is a sadist who gets a sexual high from humiliating his minions. On the day of his wedding, he is off jumping other women. He is cruel toward family and friends and happily turns on them for the slightest advantage. He doesn't dine from shining utensils sitting serenely in the traditional lotus position like the cultured Rajputs. He hunches over a table grabbing large pieces of meat with his bare hands, tearing the flesh with his teeth.
And he believes that for victory in war, no tactic is too ignoble. After killing Singh on the battlefield through treachery, he races to claim his prize. But Padmaavati, herself a paragon of virtue, calmly leads 800 women into a fiery cauldron in an act of mass self-immolation that Rajput widows were expected to perform to protect their — and their husbands' — honor. (This dénouement has rightly incensed Indian feminists struggling against traditional attitudes that measure a woman's worth by her devotion to her husband.)
It is not clear that Padmaavati ever existed, but Singh and Khilji were real historical figures and, unsurprisingly, much more nuanced than the movie's ridiculous caricatures. But literally every Hindu in the film, except the king's Brahmin tutor, is upright, humane, and decent — and every Muslim, but for Khilji's wife, is craven, randy, and slothful.
Such demeaning portrayals would be controversial under any circumstances. But today, when Muslims (and other religious minorities) are under siege in India, they are downright irresponsible.
Casual bigotry against Muslims has always existed in India. But since Modi assumed office, the situation has gotten considerably worse. Hindu nationalism's singular project is to restore Hindu pride and identity by avenging historic harms, real and imagined, inflicted on Hindus by "Muslim invaders" who ruled the country for centuries.
Lynching of Muslims suspected of consuming beef — which is taboo for Hindus — has become commonplace. And in recent years, paranoid Hindus have taken to accusing Muslim men of engaging in "love jihad" — or converting Hindu women by seducing them into marriage. (Christians face analogous allegations.) Hardly a day goes by when Hindu thugs don't beat up a Hindu-Muslim couple somewhere in the country. Last month, a court actually annulled a marriage between a Muslim man and a 25-year-old Hindu woman in med school. The court concluded that a woman of her station and background could not possibly in her right mind have consented to such a nuptial without being "brainwashed," her protestations that she was in love with her husband notwithstanding.
Given all of this, you would probably think that Muslims would be protesting this movie, directed by a Hindu with an all-Hindu cast, for feeding every single rabid anti-Muslim stereotype. Instead, it is Hindu extremists who have taken to the streets.
They torched 200 buses in Modi's home state of Gujarat after a court denied their demand for a nationwide ban on the movie. Several states ruled by Modi's party have nevertheless banned the film — and states that haven't have had to post armed guards outside theaters to protect patrons and property. One Hindu politician has declared a bounty on the head of the film's director and the actress who plays Padmaavati. And in a truly shocking episode, thugs pelted a school bus full of children in a tony Delhi suburb.
What exactly are these people protesting? They claim that Padmaavati is a revered figure and, therefore, using her story to entertain and titillate is offensive.
When Muslims in India managed to get a ban on Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses because it disparaged Prophet Muhammad, they were accused of subverting liberalism's bedrock commitment to artistic freedom and open expression in a fanatical pursuit of their religion. And rightly so.
But far from disparaging Padmaavati, who isn't even a religious figure, the film unabashedly and unambiguously glorifies her. If Hindu hoodlums can be enraged by a feel-good movie like this, they can be enraged by anything. There is no logic or sense behind their protest, no method to their madness. It is offense for offense's sake.
This is a scary development that Modi should have condemned quickly and vociferously while ordering his party apparatchiks to control the extremist troublemakers. Instead, he — along with other senior politicos in his party — have stood by mute without issuing a single statement.
This is India today. The mob rules, and the nation's so-called leaders are silent.

Attack of the Desperate Democrats
Race provocateur extraordinaire Jesse Jackson made famous a slogan in his run for the Presidency in 1988. It was Keep Hope Alive. Thirty years later the American Left has replaced the word hope with another four letter h-word: hate. They hate Republicans, they hate white male conservatives, they hate Trump, they hate the unborn, they hate the American flag, and they hate the police.
The Left sees so much potential in using hate as a political weapon that they have built a hate industrial complex. If they don’t keep hate alive, the bottom of their identity politics strategy collapses.
Enough has been said about the Jussie Smollett incident. The investigation has gone from Smollett being the victim of a hateful homophobic racist attack into what appears to be a hoax. The Chicago Police Department has gone overboard to afford Smollett the benefit of the doubt, and now say that the investigation has taken a new turn. Interpret that to be a sensitive way of saying, we no longer believe his story. Here is some free advice. Whenever you hear about a race-related attack and a noose is in the story, your BS detector should go off.
It appears, and I repeat appears, that Smollett is not a victim, rather a fraud who perpetrated a cruel hoax. If this turns out to be true, Smollett committed a hate crime against three demographics, hitting the trifecta as he simultaneously smeared whites, males, and heterosexuals. If he is found to have filed a false report, he should be aggressively prosecuted.
CARTOONS | Gary Varvel

Smollett going national with this aggravates it even more. For that, there should be a federal hate crime investigation. However, the reality is that, if found to be hoax, he will not be aggressively prosecuted. If he is even charged, he will most likely receive some watered-down prosecution, pay a fine and be allowed to move on—therefore the lack of deterrence encourages others to perpetrate subsequent hoaxes.
Gay and black advocacy groups should be incensed with Smollett, but at this point, they have been silent. Smollett has cast doubt on real claims of gay and black assaults based on skin color and sexual orientation in the future. This is not something to be taken lightly. Smollett knew he had the advantage of his celebrity and platform to stage this hoax. However, he ended up flying a bit too close to the sun.
As they always do, these incidents serve as an opportunity for virtue signaling and moral preening. Ellen DeGeneres jumped in clutching her pearls over the Smollett incident. Maxine Waters, Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Corey Booker jumped in showing their support for the alleged victim Smollett while shaming the rest of America. The national liberal media learned nothing from the Covington High School incident as they ran full-speed and blindly ahead with reports of the Smollett attack. They drove their predictable narratives while using the Smollett incident as an opportunity to drag President Trump into the discussion and deceitfully chastise every white male conservative for supposedly creating a racist, homophobic environment in America. When will liberal media learn? Probably never—these kinds of stories appeal to their libelous agenda.
Race or sexual orientation attack hoaxes are not new. Recall the Air Force Academy incident in which a racial slur was written outside the room of a black cadet. After the school Superintendent Lt. General Jay Silveria flaunted his racial sensitivity by admonishing and indicting every non-black cadet as racist while yelling at them to get out of the Academy, it was determined that the black cadet wrote the slur himself. Oops. Silveria should have been disciplined for jumping to conclusions and indicting all those cadets before learning the facts. He wasn’t. Many more of these race hoaxes have occurred on college campuses. When it was discovered that the purported victim staged the incident, the media packed up their cameras and microphones and left for the next one. No one from this cabal followed up on the case for the final disposition. We seldom hear what happens to the hoax perpetrator. The liberal media is either too lazy or disinterested to keep the public informed. This allows the prosecutors to sweep cases under the rug with light sentences.

Meltdown: MSNBC Threw The Biggest Tantrum Since Hillary’s Loss After Mueller Report Shows No Trump-Russia Collusion
Matt Vespa
According to the FBI, hate crimes against whites are the fastest growing racial hate crimes in America. Let that sink in. Anti-Black hate crimes decreased in 2016. That is not what we have been led to believe by the agenda-driven liberal media.
No government agency tracks race and sexual-oriented hoaxes. They should. As long as we are monitoring the race of the driver in police traffic stops why not hoaxes? The damage and national uproar it causes makes it worth tracking.
According to a study by American Renaissance “between June 2015 and December 2017, there have been 101 reported what turned out to be hoaxes.” The breakdown is 44 fabricated acts of bias by blacks, 17 hoaxes by Middle Easterners, 13 by non-whites and 10 fabricated assaults against gays. In the case of hate-crime hoaxes, black overrepresentation is much greater. Over the last 2.5 years, on a per capita basis, blacks were 13.3 times more likely than whites to commit hate-crime hoaxes.
Identity politics encourages a cult of perpetual victimhood. Some groups find it therapeutic to be perpetually viewed as persecuted. It shields them from criticism. America has pushed racism and bigotry to the margins of society. We shame it, call it out. Although it exists, it’s on life support. There is no need to fake it.

Eureka! Did Mueller Finally Find a Genuine 'Colluder'?
Our world seems to be flying apart at an accelerating rate these days, like some sort of rapidly descending airplane in an uncontrolled spiral, ripped apart by centrifugal forces. Its social fabric is being rent in ways that would shock our grandparents. Democratic governors, Democratic state legislators and a large proportion of the Democratic Party, for example, now assent to the murder of living, born-alive infants and those about to be born. Such abominations come from a place so dark in the human soul that one wonders how we got here, and how so quickly. Many of us yearn for a world leader of tremendous moral strength, courage and conviction to step forward to condemn it in the most forceful of terms. We once had two such leaders who entered the world stage with seemingly providential simultaneity. Their names were Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II.
I had the opportunity to attend a private screening last week of a wonderful new documentary on the sidelines of this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, called The Divine Plan. The screening of this superb, virtually made-for-CPAC film should have taken place at CPAC itself, but instead was relegated to an off-site location, across the street from the main CPAC events at the Gaylord National Harbor hotel. I understand that the cost of securing a spot within CPAC for it were prohibitive.
This is a shame. It would have received a tremendously positive reception from CPAC’s audience, especially among the huge proportion of CPAC attendees who are young, post-Reagan Era conservatives. They would have benefited from the invaluable history and spirit of true conservatism offered by the movie’s exposition of Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II’s collaboration in bringing down the Soviet Union. CPAC management should have recognized the film’s power and the financial limitations of the backers for such a niche, independent production.

The Divine Plan was written and directed by fellow New Yorker, and seeker of spiritual truth, Robert Orlando. It drew from several books examining Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. One of those was A Pope and a President, by best-selling author and professor at Grove City College, Paul Kengor, who served as both a technical consultant to the film and one of the many experts who appear in it.
The film is only 80 minutes in length, and starts out by taking us through an economical, and efficient, biographical treatment of both Reagan and Karol Józef Wojtyla, who would later go on to become Pope John Paul II. There are striking similarities in the men’s youthful experiences and interests, despite their pursuing widely divergent careers. They both suffered from traumatic childhood events and privations. Wojtyla lost his mother to heart failure when he was 8years old. Reagan’s father was an alcoholic, unreliable provider, both physically and emotionally. They both were forced to become self-reliant at an early age. They were both superb athletes, of good humor, and very popular among their peers. They both pursued acting and, importantly for the monumental roles they would eventually assume, understood the power of imagery, symbolism and the spoken word. Most vitally, perhaps, they both had a deeply ingrained loathing and crystal-clear understanding of the dehumanizing nature of communism.
The rise of these two extraordinary figures was coupled with the ascendance of other principal actors who would play a pivotal role in this greatest of all plays. They included the conservative stalwart and great anti-communist British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, the intrepid Polish Solidarity labor union leader and freedom-fighter, Lech Walesa, and the brave, if hapless, President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev, to his credit, did not play to historical Soviet type when faced with the death throes of his country by lashing out in some massive purge or by invading a neighboring country. Although he did his best to stave off the inevitable, he eventually came to acknowledge the failures of his nation’s tyrannical system and opened it up to reform and freedom.
Especially poignant is the film’s treatment of the near simultaneous assassination attempts on both Reagan and Pope John Paul II. Reagan was almost felled by a bullet from a deranged young man, John Hinckley, Jr., bent on impressing a Hollywood starlet. John Paul II was shot multiple times by a man who was almost surely, based on CIA-derived intelligence discovered in Professor Kengor’s research, a hired assassin of the Soviet Union, named Mehmet Ali Agca. The Soviet Union, at the time under the control of President Yuri Andropov, a bloodless KGB-trained killer if there ever was one, was desperate to stop John Paul II, whom they recognized as a force that could bring down their oppressive and decrepit system.
The “divine” aspect of the rise and collaboration of Reagan and Pope John Paul II appears in the film on many levels, but the survival of both men following their shootings is perhaps the most moving. Both men had lost at least half, or more, of their blood volume, and the survival of either defies medical explanation. Moreover, their shootings cemented the men’s relationship, which blossomed in the wake of this shared experience. It was as Reagan was recovering from his injuries that he became determined to end Soviet oppression and to ally himself with John Paul II in this effort. He would meet with the pope on several occasions, correspond with him frequently, and share US intelligence on the Soviet Union and the freedom movement in Poland. Reagan recognized Poland as the linchpin to collapsing the entire Soviet bloc. His secret coordination with the Pope and his covert funding of Poland’s freedom movement were central to creating the fissure leading to the demise of the USSR.
Numerous experts were assembled to provide fascinating commentary in interview excerpts during the course of the movie, including those who played instrumental roles in Reagan’s collaboration with the Pope. These included Richard Allen, former Reagan National Security Advisor, and James Rosebush, Deputy Assistant to President Reagan, who was present at the historic meetings between President Reagan, Pope John Paul II, and Mother Theresa. Mr. Rosebush, author of True Reagan: What Made Ronald Reagan Great and Why It Matters, was also present at the screening and I had the pleasure of discussing both his time in the White House and the current crises our country is facing. What an opportunity to meet such a witness to and shaper of history.

Meltdown: MSNBC Threw The Biggest Tantrum Since Hillary’s Loss After Mueller Report Shows No Trump-Russia Collusion
Matt Vespa
Other interview subjects in the documentary who add indispensable color and insights to the events of that critical era included: historians Douglas Brinkley, Anne Applebaum and HW Brands, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, theologian George Weigel, Reagan biographer Craig Shirley, Bishop Robert Barron, and Institute of World Politics Professor Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, among other luminaries.
At a time when the current head of the Roman Catholic Church stands mostly silent in the face of Americans embracing infanticide (please see my earlier commentary on this subject), and demonstrates an embarrassing fecklessness, we desperately need men like Pope John Paul II and Ronald Reagan with clear moral vision and strength of character. When Pope Francis famously responded to a reporter’s question regarding homosexual priests by asking, “Who am I to judge?”, he demonstrated a shocking abdication of his role as a moral leader in the world. He is elected precisely to judge, based on a prayerful consideration of presumably deeply held convictions and understanding of millennial-old Roman Catholic tenets.
The Divine Plan is a reminder of the type of leadership our country sorely needs. Conservatism needs more such films, and CPAC would help itself by giving low-cost space to screen them. Mr. Orlando’s last project, Silence Patton, which focused on General George S. Patton and was distributed by Sony Pictures, topped the best seller charts with Amazon Prime, proving there is a market for these films. Another production in the works by Mr. Orlando will examine George Washington.
History has shown that wobbly moral knees do not for strong institutions make. Men like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan, and John Paul II are history’s rare blessings to humanity. Let’s hope history provides more such blessings to lead us before our civilization tears itself completely apart.

Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman's legal team on Friday announced that they would be seeking a new trial for the alleged Mexican drug lord. According to Guzman's team, multiple jurors violated a federal judge's instructions when they followed the media's account of the trial, the Associated Press reported.
Guzman's team plans to ask U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan to perform an evidentiary hearing “to determine the extent of the misconduct.”
The decision comes after a VICE News article was published with an interview from one of the jurors. In the interview, the juror said at least five other jurors broke protocol and followed media coverage of the case.
From VICE News' report:
Judge Brian Cogan routinely admonished the jurors to avoid news coverage and social media, and to refrain from discussing the case with each other, so that the verdict could be decided only on evidence from the courtroom. Those rules were routinely broken, according to the juror: “You know how we were told we can't look at the media during the trial? Well, we did. Jurors did.”
Part of my coverage of the trial included sharing news, analysis, and observations from the courtroom on Twitter. The juror said they routinely checked my personal Twitter feed and tweets from other journalists. “We would constantly go to your media, your Twitter… I personally and some other jurors that I knew,” the juror said.
According to the AP's report, some juror misconduct went even further than just Twitter timelines:

One juror anonymously told VICE News that five jurors and two alternates heard about child rape allegations made against Guzman that were covered by the news media but not admitted into evidence at the trial. The juror also alleged that another member of the panel used a smartwatch to look up a news story at one point during the trial.
Last week, El Chapo was convicted on murder conspiracy and drug-trafficking charges. He could face up to life in prison when his sentencing comes up in June.

By Jonathan Power January 9, 2019 Those, like some highly placed people in the US government and Congress, who say it is inevitable that Taiwan with its population of 24 million will one day return as part of mainland China rather as Hong Kong did, have really missed a beat. There is simply no likelihood […]

Supreme Court Approves Indefinite Detention of Immigrants
Last month, I wrote a piece suggesting that Americans who want to end the war in Afghanistan ought to consider supporting former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson in the GOP primary as a means of raising the profile and impact of Republican sentiment against the war. I noted that while, according to The Washington Post, 56 percent of Republican voters want to see a substantial withdrawal of US combat troops from Afghanistan this summer – half of Republicans don't think the war's worth fighting – you can count on your fingers the Republicans in the House who have supported any initiative to press against indefinite continuation of the war, and so far not a single Republican in the Senate has done anything against the war. I suggested that if Republicans critical of the war rise in the primary, that could move the debate in Washington and end the war sooner, because the so far near-monolithic support of the war by Republican officials has been a key political cause of the continuation of the war.
On Wednesday, The Washington Post noted that polling data suggests that Republican candidates who oppose the war could rise in the GOP primary: “I'd say one of the big 'surprises' coming up in the GOP primary will be the lack of Republican voter support for the war in Afghanistan,” said Republican strategist Mike Murphy. “I think we have hit a tipping point politically and this will emerge as a very big story in the Republican primaries later this year.”
The rise in the GOP primary of Republicans opposed to the continuation of the Afghanistan war could save thousands of American and Afghan lives and hundreds of billions of dollars.

On April 28, 2011, I talked to Gary Johnson about the war. While I was talking with him, I raised some other issues of US foreign policy.
Some highlights of the interview:
“I would advocate getting out of Afghanistan tomorrow … I realize that the logistics of getting out tomorrow isn't tomorrow. But it's months, it's not years.”
Johnson advocates cutting the annual military budget by 43 percent. Over ten years, this is more than seven times what President Obama proposes to cut from the military budget.
Johnson supports the bill introduced by Senator Boxer that would require the president to establish a timetable with an end date for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. This bill has, so far, not been endorsed by a single Senate Republican.
Johnson opposes the US military intervention in Libya and thinks we should get out.
Johnson questioned why we have a US military base in Okinawa – something few politicians in Washington have been willing so far to do despite the fact that the base is spectacularly hated by the local population.
Johnson supports the legalization of marijuana. He noted that half of what we now spend on law enforcement is drug-related, that we now have the world's highest incarceration rate and that much of that incarceration is related to the fact that marijuana is illegal. He argues that if marijuana were legalized and controlled, 75 percent of the border violence in Mexico would cease, saving thousands of lives.
Here is the interview, which I have abridged slightly.
Robert Naiman: Let's start with the war in Afghanistan. According to The Washington Post, half of Republican voters say the war's not worth it; 56 percent of Republicans want to see a substantial withdrawal of US combat troops from Afghanistan this summer. What is your opinion of the war in Afghanistan, and what do you propose to do?
Gary Johnson: Initially, I thought that our going into Afghanistan was totally warranted, that that is what our military is for. We were attacked, we attacked back – I'm talking about Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda. But after being there for about six months, I think we pretty well effectively wiped out al-Qaeda, or sent them elsewhere – and that would, of course, be Pakistan. So, here it is, we're there ten years later, in what I say is building roads, schools, bridges, highways, and hospitals, and we're borrowing 43 cents out of every dollar to do that, and, worse yet, men and servicewomen are losing their lives. I would advocate getting out of Afghanistan tomorrow, and for all the debate and the discussion over all the problems that we would encounter doing that, which I think would be completely warranted, I think we would have that same debate and discussion 25 years from now, if that's when we finally decide to get out.
RN: There's some discussion now about peace talks with the Afghan Taliban, an attempt to get a political resolution – what's your view on that?
GJ: That that should be our focus, and should always be our first and foremost defense would be just those kinds of initiatives. But I would want to make it really clear: I would get out of Afghanistan. This would not be a phased get-out. And I realize that the logistics of getting out tomorrow isn't tomorrow. But it's months, it's not years.
I'm talking about cutting defense spending by 43 percent and believing that we can provide a strong national defense for ourselves. And I think that defense is the key word as opposed to what I would describe as nation-building.
RN: There's a bill before the Senate now sponsored by Senator Boxer. It's essentially the same as a bill that was introduced last year by [former] senator Feingold. It would require the president to establish a timetable with an end date for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. Do you have an opinion on that policy?
GJ: I'll shoot an opinion from the hip, and that would be to support such a piece of legislation.
RN: Let me ask you about your views on the Libya war. Do you think that the US involvement is justified? What do you think about the president's decision to do this without Congressional authorization? And what do you think the US should do now?
GJ: Well, you know, Bob, what I'm doing right now requires an opinion on everything that's happening right away. So, right when Libya happened, I issued my written opinion on that. And I think it's pretty well opposed to everything we're doing in Libya, A through Z. And it starts with no Congressional authorization. Where in the Constitution does it say that because we don't like a foreign leader, that we should go in and topple the foreign leader? Who are the rebels? Are we not involved in a civil war here? And if that's what we're involved in, then don't five other countries in the Middle East qualify for this same kind of intervention? Under the umbrella of a no-fly zone, did not Saddam Hussein exist for 12 years? Under the umbrella of a no-fly zone, did not the atrocities in Bosnia occur? So, I just see this as a growing conflict, and not in any way do I see this as ending anytime too soon.
RN: And so, what do you think the US should do now?
GJ: Well, given that we're in there right now, I would be looking to extricate ourselves from that. In my opinion, the trouble with all of our interventions, at least in my lifetime, is just all the unintended consequences that go along with those interventions. Like I say, I thought Afghanistan was originally totally warranted, but it went so far beyond that initial reaction or attack back … There's no foreign threat here. There's no foreign threat in Afghanistan. There's no foreign threat in Libya.
I would have said before we went into Iraq that we didn't need to do that. First of all, I didn't see them as being a threat to us, to our national security … I thought that if we went into Iraq, we would find ourselves in a civil war, an endless civil war.
RN: You mentioned that you want to cut the military budget by 43 percent.
GJ: We can cut military spending by that amount of money and still provide a strong national defense. “Strong national defense” being the key … as opposed to … “nation-building,” I use that [term] as a context of our getting involved and spending all our resources – in this case, our borrowed resources – on building other countries when we have these same needs here in this country.
RN: The president has recently talked about a $400 billion cut from the increase that was proposed before. Some are now talking about $1 trillion in cuts, there was a bipartisan task force that recommended $1 trillion in cuts – both these proposals are over the next ten years. Do you have an opinion on these proposals?
GJ: Well, if you take what is estimated to be the entire defense budget – depending on what you include in defense – today, that number is $800 billion, so if you're going to cut 43 percent from that, you're looking at a [more than $300 billion] reduction this year going forward; so, in ten years, that would be $3 trillion. So, I think I go further than anybody else is talking about.
I come at this from the standpoint that we're spending more money on military spending than all of the other countries in the world combined, even though we're only 5 percent of the world's population.
RN: I wanted to ask you specifically about the base in Okinawa. Of course, there are hundreds of US military bases around the world. But to me, this is a kind of striking example, given that this base is so unpopular in Okinawa, so unpopular in Japan. They had a national election where it was a key issue: the incoming government had promised in its campaign that it would get rid of the US military base. The new government came in, tried to negotiate that, and the US refused, and the prime minister had to resign. Even today, the governor of Okinawa, the local governments, they're all totally against this military base – at a time when we're talking about what to cut in the budget.
So, I wanted to ask you, in particular, when we have a military base someplace where the local people don't want it, really hate it, and want it to go, do you think that should be a factor in our decision to maintain a military base there? Should we take into account the opinions of the people that live in the area?
GJ: Well, everything that you said I am aware of, and everything that you said I concur with completely. Why, why do we have a base in Okinawa? How can there be anything more frustrating than the example that you just pointed out? Yes, you would have to think that primary in the consideration of maintaining a base would be the notion that it was something that the people in the country of the base would be supporting.
RN: I wanted to ask you about your opinion on the war on drugs. This is kind of a signature issue for you. I wanted you to talk about the cost, your perception of the failure, and particularly the implications of the war on drugs for people in other countries, particularly in Mexico and Latin America – Mexico, where thousands of people have been killed in the war on drugs there; Central America, where there is now apparently a big expansion of the criminal drug trade. So, tell me about your thoughts on the war on drugs, and what you think the US should be doing instead, particularly as that relates to the impact of the war on drugs on other countries.
GJ: As governor of New Mexico, what my pledge was, and what I did, and I'm really proud of this, and I said I was going to do this, that everything was going to be a cost-benefit analysis. Everything. What are we spending our money on, and what are we getting for the money that we're spending. That there wouldn't be any sacred cows, that politics was going to be the last consideration on the list, that first and foremost it was going to be about the issues, and understanding the issues. So, when it comes to the war on drugs, I'm opposed to the war on drugs, A through Z. But I came at it initially from the standpoint of – and, you know, there's naivety, I guess, on a broad number of issues, and this is after I'm elected, one of them is, I guess I really didn't understand that half of everything we spend on law enforcement, the courts, and the prisons is drug-related. And when you think about that, that is just staggering.
And when you think about what are we getting for half of law enforcement, half the courts and half the prisons? Well, what we're getting, is we're arresting 1.8 million people a year in this country, which I point out is the population of New Mexico that gets arrested every single year. And, we now have 2.3 million people behind bars. We have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world. And this is America? Liberty, freedom, the personal responsibility that goes along with that? I guess, except when it comes to your own body and what the decisions are surrounding that.
So, going back to 1999, I came to the conclusion … that 90 percent of the drug problem is prohibition-related, not use-related. That's not to discount the problems with use and abuse, but that ought to be the focus. So, in 1999, I advocated then, I advocate it now. Legalize marijuana. Control it, regulate it, tax it. It's never going to be legal to smoke pot, become impaired, get behind the wheel of a car, do harm to others. It's never going to be legal for kids to smoke pot or buy pot. And under which scenario is it going to be easier for kids to smoke pot or buy pot? The situation that exists today, where it's virtually available anywhere, and the person that sells pot also sells harder drugs? Or a situation where, to purchase it, you would have to produce an ID in a controlled environment, like alcohol, to be able to buy it. I think you can make the case that it would be harder to buy it, in that controlled environment.
When it comes to all the other drugs – [marijuana] is the only drug that I'm advocating legalizing – but when it comes to all the other drugs, I think what we ought to really be concentrating on are harm reduction strategies, the things that we really care about, which is reducing death, disease, crime, corruption. In a nutshell, it is looking at the drug problem first as a health issue, rather than as a criminal justice issue.
So, here we have the border violence with Mexico. Twenty-eight thousand deaths south of the border over the last four years. I believe that if we legalize marijuana, 75 percent of that border violence goes away, because that's the estimate of the drug cartel's activities that revolve around the drug trade. The drug trade – prohibition – these are disputes that are being played out with guns, rather than the courts. Control this stuff, regulate this stuff, take the money out of drugs, and so goes the violence.
RN: Finally, I wanted to ask you: you know that a lot of people in America are upset about the wars and want the wars to end – all these wars, the war in Afghanistan, the war on drugs …
GJ: And you and I included in that group …
RN: Yeah. And a lot of these folks don't ordinarily vote in Republican primaries or participate in Republican caucuses. So, I wondered if you want to speak about your outreach and interest to, let's say, nontraditional Republican voters, and what you're finding when you're talking to people, some people say that these wars aren't an issue. What are you hearing from voters on the campaign trail about these wars?
GJ: Well, first of all, I am running as a Republican here, and I think that I speak on behalf of a majority of Republicans, even though they may not know that, simply because they may have heard my name, but they have no idea who I am or what I'm even talking about.
I'm thinking that I may be speaking on behalf of the majority of Republicans, or enough Republicans, to actually win the primary, but I'm putting that to the test.
RN: Thank you so much for taking time for me.
GJ: And thank you for your activism. I appreciate what you do, because these conflicts are ridiculous. And – you have goals – should I ever reach this goal of holding this office, of being the guy on the watch, one of those goals would be to have no man or servicewoman lose his or her life.

By ignoring global warming, the U.S. is painting itself (and the world) into a corner. But now the fossil fuel industry has prepared an escape for us. You may not have heard of it, but the escape is called “carbon capture and storage” or CCS for short. It has never been tried on anything like the scale needed to limit global warming, so it's a colossal experiment with the future of civilization at stake. More on that in a moment, but first let's look at the corner we're in:
The chief economist of the International Energy Agency (IEA) recently said, “The world is perfectly on track to 11 degrees Fahrenheit increase in temperature, which is very bad news. And everybody, even school children, know this will have catastrophic implications for all of us.”
We face unprecedented tornadoes like the one that ripped away much of Joplin, Missouri on May 22, 2011.
Parts of our Southwest (and Mexico) are now dryer than the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, with irregular snow pack in the Rockies disrupting water supplies and reducing crop yields. By all accounts, the future of water in the Southwest is grim.
Drought-induced insect infestations are destroying forests across the western states and mega-wildfires are increasing on every continent except Antarctica.
Record floods disrupted the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys during 2011, not to mention Biblical floods in Australia, India and Pakistan where tens of millions of people were displaced.
And we're just in the early stages of climate chaos. As the song says, “You ain't seen nothing yet.”
The 2005 Plan of Action

You don't hear much about it, but Bush-Cheney in 2005 endorsed a plan to bail us out of this mess and we're still following their script. Back then, the G8 nations, led by the U.S., formally adopted a “Plan of Action.” In it, the G8 (Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the U.S.) committed to building a global infrastructure for “carbon capture and storage” (CCS), which means burying carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ground. Now, seven years later, that infrastructure is being built worldwide. The centerpiece is the Global CCS Institute created in 2009. (The “S” in CCS can stand for “sequestration” or “storage” but it's the same thing — burying pressurized CO2 in liquid form about a mile below ground.)
CCS is by no means the only strategy in the 2005 Plan of Action — there's plenty about efficiency (doing more with less) and renewable energy (solar, wind, and so forth). But the U.S. is playing down efficiency and renewables in favor offracking for natural gas and mountaintop removal mining for coal, both of which produce CO2. Therefore the plan says we'll develop CCS, which is a get-out-of-jail-free card for fossil fuel corporations. With CCS, we could continue burning fossil fuels as long as they last and pass the CO2 on to our grandchildren's grandchildren to worry about, manage, and pay for.
CCS is being readied for that time when the chaos, heat and misery from global warming become intolerable and people start begging (or rioting) for relief — say, sometime between 2015 and 2030. If history is any guide, the 1 percent will use the crisis to stampede us into paying for their escape plan, which they're quietlypreparing now. Although there are very few actual in-the-ground demonstrations of CCS today, in preparation for large-scale operations there are now hundreds of regional consortiums, research groups, think tanks, policy initiatives, interdisciplinary collaborations, engineering firms, trade associations, consultants, risk assessors, mathematical modelers, environmental impact assessors, public opinion managers, professional conferences, technical workshops, national laboratories, other federal, state and provincial government agencies, international agreements and treaties, summer schools, university degree programs, environmental organizations, and philanthropic foundations — all committed to the plan to bury CO2 in the ground.
Impediments
Two things are blocking the road ahead for CCS — lack of funds and a skeptical public. The fossil corporations don't want to pay to bury CO2 — that's for taxpayers, as they see it. And members of the public living near proposed burial sites are simply asking, “Are you crazy?” Yes, CO2 is familiar as the fizzy in soda and beer (and yes, you exhale CO2 as you breathe), but when CO2 gets loose in concentrated form it creates an invisible puddle on the ground, which excludes oxygen, rapidly killing everything in its path. A rare natural eruption of CO2 from the bottom of Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 asphyxiated 1,746 people in their sleep. Few people want to live anywhere near a huge, buried puddle of liquid CO2 that might one day leak.
Burying CO2 in the ground is sometimes called “clean coal” but it's much biggerthan just coal. It means capturing CO2 gas from industrial sources like power plants, cement kilns, oil refineries, and garbage incinerators, compressing it into a liquid, and pumping it a mile or more below ground, hoping it will stay there forever. It's a gigantic experiment, with the future of civilization in the balance.
The first full-scale industrial plant designed for CCS is supposed to start up in Linden, New Jersey in 2017, though it hasn't yet broken ground (and may never). It's called PurGen, and each year it would convert 1.6 million tons of coal into 600,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, plus generate some electricity during hours of peak demand.
PurGen is a “clean coal” plant that would release at least 1.7 million pounds of noxious air pollutants each year just a few hundred yards upwind of Staten Island, N.Y., home to half a million people. The area around Linden and Staten Island already fails to meet federal health-based air standards. In addition, N.J. state government has officially designated Linden an “environmental justice” community because its population is disproportionately black and Hispanic, with high asthma rates.
PurGen would capture much of its own CO2, plus gather CO2 from other industries in north Jersey, compress it into a liquid, then pipe it out to sea for permanent storage below the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. The 2-foot-diameter pipe carrying liquid CO2 would extend 140 miles from Linden (at Exit 12 on the N.J. Turnpike) to a spot 70 miles offshore from Atlantic City, where a permanent platform similar to an oil rig would pump a total of 500 million tons of CO2 a mile below the seabed, 10 million tons per year for 50 years.
And PurGen is just the beginning. Implementation of the 2005 plan calls for (large PDF) construction of 3,400 full-scale CCS burial projects between 2020 and 2050, some beneath land, some beneath the ocean, with 1,200 of them in G8 countries and another 2,200 in China, India, Russia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. Another estimate, by Harvard's Daniel Schrag, sees as much as two trillion tons (or more) of pressurized liquid CO2 being buried this century. If that happened, even low leakage rates could release tonnages of CO2 sufficient to create a new global-warming threat.
As with fracking, CCS has created a chasm of suspicion and mistrust within the environmental movement. The Big Green environmentalists with offices in Washington, D.C. favor fracking to produce natural gas, so long as it's subject to “the best regulations,” whatever that means. Unfortunately, no matter how strict the regulations may be, burning natural gas inevitably produces CO2, so Big Green also favors burying CO2 in the ground. Big Green assumes we face a fossil-fueled future and therefore we need CCS. Unfortunately, Big Green's support of CCS becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy, helping create a fossil-fueled future. The fossil corporations are already using the promise of CCS to lobbypowerfully against investments in efficiency or renewables, locking us into a fossil future.
But not everyone is buying it. Grassroots groups — led by people living near the fracking rigs, the coal plants, and the CO2 burial experiments — oppose CCS and favor aggressive energy efficiency. They argue that huge improvements in efficiency (doing more with less) are affordable (even profitable) and available off the shelf today. Further, they argue, efficiency can create tens of thousands of good jobs almost immediately and can save trillions of dollars, which in turn can pay for a modern renewable-energy economy based on even greater efficiency plus solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels, hydro, tidal power and a modernized electric grid.
David Goldstein, who won a MacArthur “genius” award, has spelled out the realistic possibilities of efficiency in his book Invisible Energy. Goldstein argues that it would be easy to run the U.S. economy with only half the energy we currently use. Running the economy on only 20 percent of current energy (or even less) would be more difficult, but is doable, Goldstein argues. And he's not alone. (See also Sovacool, 2008.)
Of course the fossil corporations don't want efficiency — they want to sell product. They favor creative ways to mine and burn oil, gas and coal, burying the hazardous waste CO2 below ground. In supporting CCS the fossil corporations are joined by major fossil users — car companies, electric utilities, the mining and mining-services industries, and the railroads. Together they form a potent political force with essentially limitless funds with which to buy elections. So, yes, Barack Obama favors offshore oil, coal, fracking, and CCS. So long as we allow big money to influence our democratic institutions (legislatures, courts, and elections) any president will have to fall in line.
A Letter to Lisa Jackson
Recently CCS has been critiqued by a group of environmental justice advocates, joined by scientists and engineers from Harvard, Georgia Tech, University of South Carolina, and Dillard University, calling themselves the Environmental Justice and Science Initiative. In April 2011, 18 members of the Initiative signed a long letter to Lisa Jackson, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) opposing the PurGen proposal in Linden and spelling out a host of technical concerns about CCS. (Full disclosure: I signed the letter.)
The Jackson letter makes some of the following points, among others:
A CCS industry large enough to make a real difference in global warming would have to be enormous. Burying one-eighth of global CO2 emissions today would require an infrastructure the size of the global petroleum industry.
CCS only buries CO2 and does not address the other health or environmental effects from mining, transport, processing or burning of fossil fuels.
A CCS system requires large amounts of energy to operate. When equipped with CCS, an industrial plant requires 25 percent to 40 percent more fossil fuel than the same plant without CCS. In other words, for every four power plants fitted with CCS, we'd need a fifth plant just to run all the CCS equipment. This large “energy penalty” for CCS contributes to high costs, excessive wastes, and more human disease from mining and burning fossil fuels.
An industrial philosophy that promotes wasteful technologies violates the principles of both green chemistry and green engineering.
Every dollar spent on CCS is a dollar that can't be invested in a modern energy system based on maximum efficiency and renewables. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that a CCS system large enough to manage 20 percent of global CO2 emissions in 2050 would cost $45 trillion. And sooner or later, we'll run out of affordable fossil fuels, so eventually we'll have to pay to develop renewables anyway. Why not skip the costly, experimental CO2 burial stage and go for efficiency and renewables now?
Leaks and releases of concentrated CO2 are toxic to plants and animals, including humans.
Long-term leakage to the atmosphere will be an ongoing concern for millennia. CCS sites would have to be monitored for leakage for something like 4,000 to 10,000 years, with someone standing ready all that time to plug leaks (if plugging is even feasible). Humans have never created a watchdog agency intended to last for millennia. And this watchdog would have to coordinate operations at thousands of CO2 burial sites in dozens of countries, essentially forever. Does this sound like something humans can manage?
Judging by the PurGen example, CCS plants may tend to end up in communities of color already burdened with pollution. EPA should oppose any such trend, and should definitely oppose the PurGen project, the lettersaid.
This, then, is the escape plan the fossil corporations say will ensure our future (and their outsized profits). Congress, President Obama, Big Green, and everyone else chasing a slice of the $45 trillion CCS pie are all betting the future of civilization. They say long-term leakage can be managed and nothing can go seriously wrong. Hmmm. What if it turns out they are mistaken?

Yesterday, in the Oval Office, while US President Donald Trump was on the phone with Leo Varadkar, the new Taoiseach, to congratulate him on his political success, the President seemed to start flirting with one of the Irish journalists who was there to report on it, Caitriona Perry.
Leo Varadkar was elected to lead the Fine Gael Party at the beginning of the month after Enda Kenny retired and, two weeks ago, Dáil Éireann nominated him to be the Taoiseach, which was later approved by the President of Ireland.

Suffice to say, it’s been a heck of a month for Mr. Varadkar. But Trump appeared to be more interested in complimenting Perry’s “beautiful smile” than complimenting Varadkar’s recent successes.
Trump and Varadkar were discussing political matters when he got distracted
Trump had been talking to the Irish premier about important political matters like migration and Brexit when he got distracted by a “beautiful” reporter who caught his eye with her “nice smile.” He linked Varadkar into it by saying, “Well, we have a lot of your Irish press watching us.” His sights were specifically on Perry, one of the Washington correspondents for RTE (Raidió Teilifís Éireann, the national public service broadcaster for the Republic of Ireland – read: Irish BBC) as he asked her, “And where are you from?”
Perry appeared uncomfortable as Trump told her, “Go ahead.

Come here, come here. Where are you from?” He then told Varadkar, “We have all of this beautiful Irish press,” which was likely a shrewd attempt at a faux-shy, “aw, shucks” flirtation with Perry, but she wasn’t biting. Trump told Varadkar that based on Perry’s “nice smile,” he can assume that “she treats you well.”
He said this because he does not believe that the free press of the United States treats him well, which he would describe as lying and presenting everything he does with a conservative bias, like Fox News, the only US news outlet he likes.

But all the news sources that Trump hates – MSNBC (whose staff he called “bad people”), CNN, The New York Times etc. – are simply calling it as they see it.
Perry described the experience as a ‘bizarre moment’ in her life
Perry posted a video of the experience on Twitter, describing it as a “bizarre moment” in her career. Her social media followers were horrified to see Trump’s behaviour towards her, with some of them describing it as “sexist.” One commenter called the video “kind of creepy,” and suggested that Trump was “being sexist” when he made his comments.

One commented on Instagram asked Perry if she felt as though Trump was “judging you based on your looks.” In an interesting turn of events, the video has been removed from Instagram. Perhaps the white house got in touch with Perry and threatened her with sanctions, since it’s not like they have anything more important to do.
Who is Caitriona Perry?
Caitriona Perry, the Irish reporter with whom Trump was attempting to flirt, has been an RTE correspondent since 2000, according to their website. She’s 37, a whole decade younger than Trump’s wife and First Lady Melania, to whom he claims to be happily married (although her body language at public appearances suggests otherwise).

Perry was the 2015 winner of the National Justice Media Merit Award for TV News and has reported from all over the globe, including Europe, Australia, the United States (obviously), Canada, and Latin America. She has described working as a news correspondent in Washington as her “dream job,” although after her surreal, uncomfortable encounter with a flirtatious President Trump, she may be calling up her bosses to request a transfer.

UPDATE 2-Trump threatens action on WTO after reports he wants to withdraw
3 Min Read
(Recasts with Trump threatening action; adds quotes by Trump)
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to take action against the World Trade Organization on Monday after media reports said he wanted to withdraw from the global trade regulator.
Trump has complained frequently that the United States is treated unfairly in global trade and has sharply criticized the WTO for letting that happen.
“WTO has treated the United States very badly and I hope they change their ways. They have been treating us very badly for many, many years and that’s why we were at a big disadvantage with the WTO,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
“And we’re not planning anything now, but if they don’t treat us properly we will be doing something,” he said.
News website Axios last week reported that the Republican president wants to withdraw from the WTO, drawing a prompt denial on Friday from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.
Axios reported on Sunday that Trump, who has made fighting unfair trade rules a pillar of his presidency, has ordered that legislation be written stipulating a WTO withdrawal.
But Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said earlier on Monday it was too soon for the United States to discuss any withdrawal from the World Trade Organization.
“WTO knows some reforms are needed. I think there really is a need to update and synchronize its activities, and we’ll see where that leads,” Ross told CNBC. “But I think it’s a little premature to talk about simply withdrawing from it.
“We’ve made no secret of our view that there are some reforms needed at the WTO,” Ross said.
Trump’s aggressive stance on trade has roiled U.S. relations with allies and trading partners from Europe to China. He pulled out of negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership shortly after taking office last year and began renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with neighbors Canada and Mexico.
More recently, he imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imported into the United States from various countries and is set to impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports beginning on Friday. (Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Jeff Mason; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Leslie Adler)

House incumbent taken down in Dem primary

HOUSE INCUMBENT TAKEN DOWN IN DEM PRIMARY…. As a rule, House Democratic incumbents fare pretty well in primary campaigns when challenged from the right. There are, however, exceptions.
Rep. Alan B. Mollohan (D-W.Va.) lost his bid for a 15th term Tuesday in a primary defeat that further affirms the anti-incumbent sentiment coursing through the country.
He is the first House member to lose a reelection bid in the 2010 campaign, and his defeat comes days after Sen. Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah) was knocked off the November ballot in that state’s convention process.
Mollohan hadn’t faced a serious primary fight in more than a decade and was seen in some circles as unbeatable, given that the state’s 1st Congressional District seat had been in his family since 1968. (His father held it for seven terms before he won it.)
But state Sen. Mike Oliverio ran hard against Mollohan’s entrenched-incumbent status and made much of the lingering whiff of ethics problems that dogged the congressman for years.
It wasn’t especially close — with nearly all the precincts reporting, Oliverio beat Mollohan, 56% to 44%.
The parallels with Bennett’s recent defeat in Utah are a little misleading. Bennett lost because the Republican base decided he wasn’t right-wing enough. In West Virginia, Mollohan wasn’t “purged” by the Democratic base for being a moderate; the incumbent’s challenger was far more conservative than he was.
So, what happened here? Most of the media analysis will focus on the lousy climate for incumbents, and that was certainly part of the equation in WV1. But the variables paint a more complex picture. Mollohan faced a lengthy ethics investigation, and while he never faced formal charges, the probe made it easy for Oliverio to raise questions about the incumbent’s integrity.
Moreover, by all accounts, Mollohan simply didn’t take the primary threat seriously until it was too late. After 14 terms, he grew complacent. Indeed, in 2008, Mollohan didn’t even face a Republican challenger (he also ran unopposed in 2002 and 2000).
The issues didn’t help, either. Conservative opponents of abortion rights attacked Mollohan for supporting the Affordable Care Act — there are a lot of pro-life Dems in West Virginia — and while Mollohan opposed cap-and-trade, he was perceived as not having fought it aggressively enough.
As for what’s next, Republicans conceded that they hoped Mollohan would win the primary, because they saw him as easier to beat in November. In this sense, the Democrats’ odds of holding onto the seat may have actually improved slightly in light of the primary results.
But an Oliverio victory in the general election may not mean much to the party in 2011 — the conservative state lawmaker would vote with Republicans on nearly everything, and has already said he doesn’t expect to support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker. Oliverio is, in other words, practically the quintessential “Democrat in Name Only.”

Georgia Republicans went to the polls yesterday in a runoff election to determine their nominee in November’s race for governor. Trump-endorsed candidate Brian Kemp trounced Casey Cagle, who had been supported by Georgia’s current governor Nathan Deal. You might remember Kemp as the guy who pointed a shotgun at the young man who wanted to date his daughter in a campaign ad. He staked his claim on being the politically incorrect candidate who, in another ad, said that he has a big pickup truck “just in case I need to round up criminal illegals.”
Brian Kemp is more than simply a Trump wannabe when it comes to guns and immigrants. Last year, as Secretary of State, he purged almost 600,000 Georgians from the voter rolls.
The cancellation of voter registration in such massive numbers raises concerns especially because the Secretary of State’s office used voters’ lack of electoral participation as justification for the move. Under the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act, using non-voting as a basis to purge registered voters from the rolls is prohibited.
In the summer of 2016, when the Obama administration’s primary concern about Russia’s cyber attacks was that they would hack into state voting systems, former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson held a conference call with state officials to offer them federal assistance in securing their systems. Kemp saw it as a Democratic plot to interfere in the election and denied the facts about what Russia was up to.
Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary of state of Georgia, used the call to denounce Johnson’s proposal as an assault on state rights. “I think it was a politically calculated move by the previous administration,” Kemp said in a recent interview, adding that he remains unconvinced that Russia waged a campaign to disrupt the 2016 race. “I don’t necessarily believe that,” he said.
Kemp also has a history with his opponent in November, Stacey Abrams. She founded an organization called the New Georgia Project, whose goal was to increase voter registration in the state. Those efforts became a target for the then-Secretary of State.
Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp—a Republican—said his office was investigating allegations of voter fraud from the New Georgia Project, following complaints about voter applications submitted by the group. To that end, Kemp has issued subpoenas to the group and its parent organization, Third Sector Development…
To Abrams, this has less to do with protecting the process and more to do with suppressing the registration effort. After all, she notes, Georgia law “requires that we turn in all application forms we collect, regardless of concerns over validity.” It’s the job of the secretary of state, she says, to determine the status of the applications. “We do not get to make the decisions about whether or not a form is valid or not.”
As Daniel Strauss reports, this contest “will put before Georgia voters one the sharpest contrasts of any major campaign in the country this fall.” Abrams is running as an unapologetic liberal who embraces the idea that running to be the country’s first African American female governor is a strength, not a liability. As Jamil Smith noted, she has a strategy.
“My approach is this,” Abrams says. “I’m not going to spend a disproportionate share of our resources trying to convert Republican-leaning voters when we can invest in lifting up the voices of those who share our values. Because here’s the thing: I think our values are the right ones. And I think these values that are shared actually are going to be victorious on their own.”
But anyone who suggests that Abrams will implement that strategy in a way that is disrespectful of white working class Georgians hasn’t been paying attention and is simply buying into an outdated narrative. Here’s what Abrams said on the night of her primary victory:
We are writing the next chapter of Georgia’s history where no one is unseen, no one is unheard and no one is uninspired. We are writing a history of Georgia where we prosper together…For the journey that lies ahead, we need every voice in our party and every independent thinker in the state of Georgia…That is why we are here to ensure that all Georgians, from farmers in Montezuma to mill workers in Dalton, know that we value them. So that educators in Sparta and airport workers in College Park know that we see their efforts. So that former prisoners across our state who are working towards more know that we believe in their redemption.
What this race comes down to is that voters in a southern confederate state that is trending purple will be the first to weigh in on whether democracy takes precedence over identity. Kemp’s attempt to fear monger about immigrants and suppress the vote (primarily of low income people of color) will go up against the small “d” democratic ideal that all (wo)men are created equal and are welcome participants in a government “of the people, by the people, for the people.”

Build a castle in the sand, pay a fine out the butt
Build a castle in the sand, pay a fine out the butt
Jim Addison March 29, 2008 Asshats, Environment, Law, Politicians, Sign Of The Times 23 Comments
After an Isle of Palms (near Charleston, SC) patrol officer twisted his ankle on the beach one night, the morons on City Council set to work to regulate the villainous children who dig sand on the beach, leaving holes. Jessica Johnson reports for The Post and Courier:
Building in the sand is free, but beach lovers who leave their castles behind could soon pay the price.
Under a new proposal, beachcombers could get a $128 to $500 ticket for not flattening sand castles and not filling in holes when they’re through. City leaders intend to discuss the proposal more in the next month.
* * * * *
Police and Mayor Mike Sottile said enforcement would be nearly impossible. They would have to watch the creation from start to finish and then catch its sculptors as they walk away.
Isle of Palms City Councilman Ryan Buckhannon, who sits on the public safety committee that formulated the law’s first draft, said the provision is part of a bigger proposal aimed at stopping droves of tourists from leaving items and large holes behind.
“It’s a disposable world now,” he said.
Tourists often abandon their tents, coolers and surfboards for others to enjoy. The proposed law would require people to pick up after themselves and knock over sand castles before leaving the area.
Read the entire story at the link above. Naturally, the enforcement would be just as difficult for “tents, coolers and surfboards” as it would for sand castles and holes. As one commenter noted, what about those pesky sea turtles? They sneak onto the beach, dig holes, and leave their soft eggs covered up like a trap for the unwary beach patrols – should we fine the turtles, too?
OR, as another noted, maybe the night beach patrol officers could carry flashlights so they don’t walk into holes – you know, sort of like a normal human being who must navigate uneven terrain in the dark?
Isle of Palms beachfront homeowners are notorious for fighting against public access, while simultaneously demanding millions in public funding for “beach renourishment” to replenish the sand which the anti-environment Atlantic Ocean takes away without regard to local ordinance. Next time they show up at the state legislature with their hands out, I hope they are told to “go pound sand.”
Thanks to readers Kris Franzen of South Carolina and Doug Ridley of New York, who both tipped me to this story.

Why the Dow Couldn't Keep Up Today
Share
Brendan Byrnes, The Motley Fool, AOL.com
Aug 22nd 2012 10:00PM
In today's edition, industrials editor and analyst Brendan Byrnes discusses the Dow's interesting day today. The blue-chip index dropped in early trading on disappointing Japanese export data and more concerns about Greece and a potential new bailout for the country. But the tide started to turn this afternoon, when minutes from the Federal Reserve's July 31-Aug. 1 meeting were released. The minutes indicated that further stimulus action from the Fed is possible "fairly soon." That was enough to drag the S&P 500 into positive territory, though the Dow's comeback fell just short.
Individually, Hewlett-Packard was the biggest loser on the Dow today, dropping 3.6% ahead of earnings. The stock gained some of that back after hours following an earnings report that beat expectations, though revenue was slightly disappointing. Outside the Dow, Zynga rose 10% after being upgraded by JPM Securities. Still, this is a stock that Brendan thinks long-term investors should stay far, far away from. Check out the following video for more on the Dow's day, and which other stocks made headlines today.
With the seemingly endless cycle of good news one day and bad news another, many investors may understandably be tempted to take their money and run far from the stock market. But that can be one of the biggest mistakes investors can make. Some of the most successful stock picks are great dividend stocks that are held for the long term. With that in mind, we've taken an in-depth look at all 30 Dow components and picked out our three favorite Dow dividend stocks that investors can buy right now. You can find the names and analysis of these companies in our brand-new free report: "The 3 Dow Stocks Dividend Investors Need." Read the report now -- it's absolutely free.

Tom Heneghan Update - Mueller Took The Bait! He’s Toast! - December 6, 2017

Mueller Took The Bait! He’s Toast! Tom Heneghan
Wednesday, December 6, 2017 17:19
(Before It's News)
https://youtu.be/hyce8Sc_rK4
Tom Heneghan and Stew Webb latest intel report is in the above video. One of the things Tom covers in this report is the smoke screen Robert Mueller put out saying he was going after Donald Trump’s Deutsche Bank records. This is a total LIE!
Here’s the fake news story.
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/business/dealbook/steve-case-flyover-startups.html
and here’s where Trump’s lawyers say Mueller is lying. The records aren’t for Trump! Tom Heneghan reports Mueller is going after the Duetsche Bank records to try to cover up evidence the swamp did 9/11 and make money from it!
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-deutsche-bank/trump-lawyer-denies-deutsche-bank-got-subpoena-on-trump-accounts-idUSKBN1DZ0XN
In reality Mueller is acting as a “Cleaner” for the Bush Clinton crime syndicate. He’s trying to get the Duetsche Bank records for the time period right before 9/11 to cover up the massive money made by many in the deep state on put options on American Airlines, United Airlines and insurance companies!
Robert Mueller must be getting paid a lot to think he’s going to get away with destroying the evidence of somehow fixing it for the swamp. It’s not going to happen! He took the bait and now he’s totally exposed!
The white hats have all of this banking information already and so does Trump! The good guys already know everybody who profited form the 9/11 false flag attacks! Mueller is going to be on the hot seat very soon! He’s going to be asked a lot of uncomfortable questions. It’s all going to come out! Watch the rats begin to turn on each other soon when their fantasy Russian collusion story continues to fall apart! December and January should be great months for patriots!
Tom Heneghan has heard of big shakedown coming in the FBI very soon. The swamp creatures there are starting to feel the heat! I heard a report that somebody on Fox News reported the entire FBI was going to have to take lie detector tests! We know if this happens, many of the FBI swamp creatures will be exposed! Lie detectors will drain the FBI, DOJ and NSA swamp faster than anything!
The source MegaAnon who is the only anonymous source out there that really hasn’t been wrong at all yet. She is saying that many in the FBI will go down.
>>152018576
There will be a lot more to this and like I said a long time ago y’all, Comey and Mueller are friends with their own bones to pick. Not good guys or your guys, as they should’ve resigned but there are MANY in the swamp who didn’t choose to be there. These people also like negotiating plea bargains and deals.
Comey’s been trying to tell you for months that he’d have indicted Hillary. He told you EXACTLY why he would’ve, the day he also didn’t suggest charges right after saying it all. He’s starting to get some of that vindication he was looking for.
This is all top down. McCabe has been demoted and relieved. 5 others gone since for anti-Trump tweets. The little s*** leads to bigger s***, on all the s*** that will continue to come out from now through the new year and beyond.
If you strip away all the media bullshit, external theories, opinions, etc. and just look at the facts, you’ll see exactly where this is heading. Forget everything anyone says and all you’ve heard the media saying. Only look at the facts. “They” are f****d.
Josh Caplan is reporting his sources say big shake up at the FBI coming soon! This Week!
Sorcha Faal, our friends who put out a ton of truth had this to say which is interesting. Notice how the Washington Post is now saying that “A New Special Counsel” should investigate the FBI and DOJ!
With former American UN Ambassador John Bolton now shockingly proclaiming that President Trump is being confronted with “the first attempted coup d’état in US history”, this report details, the “Deep State” war to destroy Trump has descended into a travesty of justice with it now being said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation is nothing more than a semblance of law-enforcement disguising the brute reality that Trump is being punished for winning the election and defying Obama policy—and that, stunningly, even the rabidly anti-Trump propaganda newspaper The Washington Post agrees with, and who have just proclaimed: “A new Special Counsel needs to investigate the FBI and Justice Department. Now!”.
http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2448.htm
The reason the scumbag Washington Post is saying this is because “Special Counsels” are how the deep state destroys evidence and tries to run out the clock! They would love to have one of their boys investigate the FBI and DOJ for about 7 years going through and finding all the bad stuff so it never got out! That’s what they’ve done for decades!
Otis Johnson, secret agent who won the medal of honor, told Stew he would see some things happening to the Swamp by the end of the year. They used a Stone-R weapon on Otis and killed him after he told Stew this! Now the white hats in the Intel agencies and military are enraged that Daddy Bush ordered Otis to be killed! Stew has been told by one of his very high up sources to not worry. They were NOT going to let Otis Johnson die in vain! They will get the ones who did killed Otis and have looted America, no matter what it takes!
I think 2018 is going to be the year we start to get our country back. I think things might look bad sometimes but I know Trump will be victorious in the end. The swamp will turn on each other when the heat gets turned up. Grab the popcorn and enjoy the show!

Tasting Notes
Getting this one took some effort. Cerversera del Montseny’s Negra Stout (despite its rather attractive packaged appearance) is bottled by hand and sees very little distribution anywhere, let alone stateside. The brewery’s importer brought in a total of 35 cases last year (and a mere 12 kegs in 2014), with no further shipments planned in any considerable amount until 2015.
As the situation worked out, this is about as close as any beer gets to being a Rare Beer Club™ exclusive without actually, you know, being one. This Barcelona brewery’s dry stout is one of the best we’ve ever happened upon—a massively food-friendly dry stout that just begs for its style’s traditional pairing (freshly shucked oysters)—and it’s available basically nowhere else.
First off: give this one time to warm up to the recommended serving temperature. We found this to be true of a lot of the heavily roasted stout and porter releases we’ve been sampling as of late (especially a lot of the really potent Swedish porters crossing our path), and these dark beers tend to benefit greatly with time to warm up in one’s glass. You’ll notice a difference in even a few minutes: there’s a slight metallic quality that quickly fades—and after five minutes we found this to be an entirely different experience than that initial sip. Let this one breathe.
That patience is quickly rewarded. In the meanwhile, take a look at what we’re working with here: deep chocolate-brown color, quite dark despite its modest alcohol levels. We probably don’t need to debunk the common fallacy that dark beer = strong beer, as many of you have had pale imperial pilsners pushing 10% ABV and pitch-black session beers at this point. (It’s been a lot easier to debunk such beliefs as of late, and we’d point to something like the 4.2% Coffee Milk Stout recently released by Stone as a great example of easy-drinking dark beer.)
Fact is, Irish-style dry stouts generally tend to be reasonably light in alcohol, and those early sips (post-warming!) of Negra Stout offer up an immensely generous beer for being slightly over 5%. A medium-brown head caps the pour, with generous notes of bitter chocolate and roasted malts flying out of the glass. Hints of caramel and maybe even a touch of vanilla are present and serve to round out those darker, slightly charred malt qualities. The brewery uses wheat, oats, and rye in this beer in addition to barley, and one gets a bit of that spiciness and toasty wheat just from the nose. The wheat and oats also serve to amplify its head retention.
The aroma feels lush and entirely filled out—the bitterness of charred malts and coffee-like aromatics balanced perfectly by creamier notes approximating vanilla, almonds, and toffee.
It’s that first proper-temp sip that got us: the bright pop of prickly carbonation; its firm lines of both bitter, roasted malts and the style’s characteristic (and almost chalk-like) dry feel; and then, for sure, layers of milk and dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa powder, and other roastiness that seemed to basically unfurl forever. The overall effect is almost overly generous for what we generally expect from the style, arguably dipping its toes into full-on stout territory. There are those complementary creamy notes persisting into the flavor (hints of a robust nuttiness and very light vanilla-like sweetness), though the net effect remains dry and perfect for food.
While this is a reasonably robust release from Cervesera del Montseny, we’d not recommend putting it in the cellar for a substantial amount of time given the modest ABV levels, and we just don’t see this gaining a ton from the effects of oxidation. That said, it should still keep a pleasant overall profile for quite some time. Aside from being a perfect potential match to a briny, umami-laden oyster, we’re inclined to try it with scoops of rich vanilla-bean ice cream.
Cervesera del Montseny (Barcelona, Spain)
The Spanish microbrewery Cervesera del Montseny got its start back in 2007, the result of a group of friends getting together and wanting to brew authentically crafted beers that would prove worthy of representing Barcelona’s Montseny region. The brewery’s operations sit just beyond the borders of the sizable Parc Natural del Montseny, a UNESCO biosphere reserve that was named a national park back in the 80s. The region is home to high mountain peaks, expansive Mediterranean to sub-alpine wildlife, and some sweet megaliths (à la Stonehenge).
It’s really no wonder that the brewery focuses on the more ‘natural’ of brewing philosophies. Their original equipment—from a wood-banded mash tun to steam boiler—were purchased from Wolf Brewery, in the eastern English county of Norfolk. Cervesera del Montseny uses that country’s ale-focused brewing techniques throughout its operations, while still adhering to the German Reinheitsgebot’s mindset of core ingredients: local water, malted barleys and wheat, hops, and yeast. The Montseny beers are also unpasteurized and bottle conditioned.
The ever-vigilant importers at Shelton Brothers were among the first to recognize what was being produced at Cervesera del Montseny: expressive English-style beers crafted with great ingredients and a character typifying the growth of artisanal beer in Catalonia: “all brewed to the sound of Flamenco music reverberating through the small, spartan brewhouse in Seva.” Previously distributed only in southern Spain, we think they warrant a much wider audience.
Beyond the Bottle: Caviar Wishes and Dry-Stout Dreams?
By Ken Weaver
I generally avoid talking directly about any early samples I get to try in this column—if only because the tasting notes tend to handle those pretty thoroughly without it. But I was really impressed with Cervesera del Montseny’s take on the dry stout style, and it got me thinking about other examples I’ve tried over the years that might have made a similar impression.
It basically made me realize that I couldn’t really remember any. So…I went digging through my notes, looking for things that had made an impact (at least temporarily). Bell’s Trumpeter Stout is one of our top examples on RateBeer, if pretty much draft-only at this point. A good friend from DC shared a bottle back in 2007, and it played out more complexly than most of them, with plenty of cocoa, roasted nuts, and chocolate. I picked up Porterhouse’s Wrasslers XXXX Stout from Ireland (with that crazy pull-tab cap) at a bottle shop in Nevada: offering milk chocolate, caramel roundness, and a touch of noble hops. As I think is often the case, it ends up being examples that provide a bit more than our stylistic expectations that stand out.
Russian River’s OVL Stout (unlike the above two) weighs in about 4.2% ABV and does very well expressing roast, coffee, and smoked meats in a modestly sized package. But: draft only.
If you’re looking for examples to try side-by-side with this month’s stout (beyond Guinness, which will seem even less generous by the comparison), a few good, well-distributed options include North Coast’s Old No. 38 Stout, Flying Dog Pearl Necklace, and Moylan’s Dragoon.

Mariah Carey Silences Nick Cannon With Gag Order | Mariah Carey | Nick Cannon | Celebrities | BET
has reportedly been slapped with a gag order by his soon-to-be ex-wife Mariah Carey.
According to TMZ, Nick and Mariah's lawyers hashed out a confidentiality agreement as a part of their divorce. The only problem is that it was allegedly created completely in Mariah's favor.
Cannon is not allowed to say a word about the split, and if he does, he will be hit with serious financial penalties. Mariah, on the other hand, has the right under the agreement to speak on the split as she pleases.
The agreement only allows Nick to speak on their separate living situations — something he's already spoken of — and that's about it.
The couple tied the knot after less than a month of dating in a surprise ceremony in the Bahamas in 2008. They have two children together, twins Morroccan and Monroe.

Report: Bobby Brown Forced to Go Back on Tour | Bobby Brown | Celebrities | BET
| CLICK HERE FOR THE UPS AND DOWNS OF BOBBI KRISTINA BROWN |
According to TMZ, the R&B star is reportedly scheduled to play three shows down under with Treach and Kay Gee of Naughty by Nature at the end of May. Sources say, however, that for obvious reasons, he is in no mood to perform. It is also reported that the May tour dates are to make up for shows that were canceled back in March. Though the former New Edition frontman wanted to push the dates back, the event's promoters aren't having it.
Bobbi Kristina is currently staying in a private room at a rehabilitation facility where she is said to be hooked up to various machines. Brown reportedly visits her regularly and makes all of her medical decisions. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the Brown and Houston family.

Knee Deep Brewing Responds to Sony Lawsuit Over Breaking Bud
April 19, 2018 BlaBlaBeer	
Hollywood and local news outlets reported last night that Knee Deep Brewing was issued a lawsuit over their label for their IPA Breaking Bud. [Link.] In a nutshell, Sony believes their intellectual property is being lifted by Knee Deep using likenesses from the famous television show Breaking Bad. Whether or not parody laws protect Knee Deep Brewing or not, this is pretty serious as there is a huge size difference between the two companies. The label shown in this post uses a similar text logo to the show, and the Knee Deep character depicts Walter or Jesse, the two main characters of the hit show. Make sure you never miss another beer story like this by subscribing to our daily newsblast by clicking here.
This afternoon, Knee Deep Brewing issued this response.
From our CEO, regarding our friends at Sony: “I was surprised by the unexpected lawsuit filed against us by Sony yesterday, especially after they originally contacted us many years ago touting their appreciation of our Breaking Bud beer that made gentle fun of their show. Shortly after Breaking Bud was introduced, in early 2015, I actually received an email from a Sony representative that said, “It seems the Knee Deep team are big fans of Breaking Bad and we really appreciate the call out to our very popular show.”

‘It’s Not Just Tunisians Who Know How to Bomb’: Illegal Migrant’s Chilling Christmas Threat to Italy
FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images
VIRGINIA HALE
26 Dec 2016
“We will make your children pay”, a Senegalese man told terrified passengers on a Genoa bus on Christmas Eve, warning that African migrants will bomb the city.
The 38 year old Muslim migrant promised that Africans will launch a terror assault in Italy and, appearing to refer to the Berlin terror attack last Monday, in which an Islamist ploughed a truck into a crowd of people at a Christmas market, he warned: “We will put a bomb here in Genoa, so it will be a happy Christmas for you too”
“We will make your children pay everything. It’s not just the Tunisians who know how to do those things”, the migrant said. Passengers panicked as the African continued to issue similar bomb threats and warnings until police, summoned by the driver, arrived at the scene.
Alarmed to see officers boarding the vehicle, the migrant stammered “Police… M-merry Christmas to you too”. In addition to menacing and verbally abusing passengers and the driver, he lashed out at police and repeatedly slammed his head and feet into the bus windows.
The African was arrested for resisting the police, and referred to the judicial authorities for interrupting a public service. Investigations revealed that the man had already been arrested on several occasions. Although he’s an illegal immigrant with a record of aggravated robbery, magistrates left the Senegal native free to roam the city, requiring him only to provide a signature.
The incident was reported to Italy’s counterterrorism agency, which has now launched further investigations into the illegal immigrant.
Italy has so far avoided terror attacks like those seen in France, Belgium, Britain and Germany. But migrants dissatisfied with everything from the amount of pocket money from taxpayers, the food hotels serve and the clothes that charities give them, to not being provided with a personal television in each bedroom, have vowed “revenge” on the Italian people.
In November, Africans rioted and terrorised the residents of Turin, in protest at not being given a “decent life” by taxpayers. “You Italians — tell your children that we are not dogs. Keep them quiet because our patience will end sooner or later,” one warned.
Another cheered the Bataclan massacre in which 89 people were murdered, hailing it as a “revenge of the excluded”. “One dead of ours [Africans], one death of yours,” he cried.
Beppe Grillo, founder of Italy’s populist Five Star Movement, has called for half a million illegal migrants be immediately expelled from the country following the terror attack in Berlin.
“Those who have asylum can stay in Italy, but all the irregulars must be repatriated now, started from today. Now is the moment for us to protect ourselves,” he wrote in a blog post.

Fr. Pavone: Donald Trump’s Splinter and Nancy Pelosi’s Beam

FR. FRANK PAVONE
22 May 2018
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) appears to have a special mission to defend the dignity and rights of people and organizations that torture, dismember, and mutilate their victims.
Faced with President Donald Trump’s widely reported comments on the MS-13 gang’s reputation for sadistic, brutal violence where Trump referred to the gang members as “animals,” Ms. Pelosi rose up in righteous indignation.
“Does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person?” Pelosi asked.
“The crimes that we’re talking about are brutal,” said Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas, in reference to acts by MS-13 gang members. “Their weapon of choice is a machete. We end up seeing people with injuries that I’ve never seen before. You know, limbs hacked off.”
One female MS-13 member kidnapped a 15-year-old girl and tortured her, cutting out the girl’s tattoo. “That’s just a level of cruelty even I’m not used to after almost 35 years in this business,” said one veteran law enforcement official.
Curiously, Ms. Pelosi’s vehement defense of a group that tortures, dismembers, and mutilates its victims on a daily basis line up perfectly with her defense of the abortion industry, another group that tortures and dismembers its victims for profit.
In his description of a D&E abortion of a preborn baby in the womb, former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino said, “In a D&E procedure you must use a grasping clamp … there’s rows of teeth.” Levatino said, “When this gets a hold of something it does not let go … grabbing at parts of the baby, and then getting a hold and pulling, and you really pull… all of a sudden you pull out an arm or a leg that big and put it down on the table next to you.”
Somehow, Ms. Pelosi is able to recognize the “spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person” in gang members and abortionists, but not in unborn children.
Reasonable people of faith understand that the president’s comments on MS-13 members reflected the president’s disgust at the actions of this brutal gang.
We want our president to work vigorously to help convict MS-13 members of their heinous crimes and work with the states to deport any illegal immigrant members of the gang.
Yet, as Christians, we still do recognize the dignity of MS-13 members as human beings made in the image and likeness of their Creator. We pray for their conversion.
But Nancy Pelosi has no moral authority to call out her president — as a congresswoman or as a Catholic Christian — while she openly promotes the torture, dismemberment, and desecration of innocent pre-born children.
Jesus famously upbraided the religious leaders of his day for their hypocrisy, as those who would look to the speck in their brother’s eye while failing to observe the plank in their own.
“Hypocrite! First take the beam of wood out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother’s eye,” he said.
Nancy Pelosi has publicly pointed out the splinter in the president’s eye.
She seems to remain blind to the very large beam in her own.

New York Times to Vacate ‘at Least’ Eight Floors as Profits Tumble
Dan Flynn
BEN KEW
16 Dec 2016 New York
The New York Times is planning to vacate “at least eight floors” in its Manhattan headquarters as part of a plan to cut costs, generate rental income, and redesign office space, according to an internal memo.
In a message to company employees, CEO Mark Thompson said that the company had “made the decision to consolidate our footprint across the building to create a more dynamic, modern and open workplace, one that is better suited to the moment.”
“We’re planning significant investments in a redesign of our existing space in order to facilitate more cross-departmental collaboration. We expect a substantial financial benefit as well. All told, we will vacate at least eight floors, allowing us to generate significant rental income,” he continued.
The memo also confirmed that the near 400 employees currently stationed in the floors soon to be vacated will be moved to a temporary location until the end of 2017, when the redesign will be completed.
The retrenchment effort comes a month after the New York Times announced a 95.7 percent fall in quarterly profit, something which they attributed to restructuring changes related to headcount reductions.
Last week, when delivering a speech on the perceived problem of “fake news,” Thompson made a pitch for new subscribers, claiming that “if you want real journalism, you as a consumer will have to pay for it. So subscribe. Subscribe to your local paper, or The New York Times.”

On the Stagnant State of French Society
The Daily Reckoning
Apr. 8, 2011, 1:00 PM
We have come to France "a l'improviste" on a sad mission. We are on our way to a funeral. A 20-year-old neighbor was undergoing treatment for leukemia, and making progress following a bone-marrow transplant. And then, in his vulnerable state, an infection carried him away.
Here in France, we see things much as we left them…
But that is the problem with France. Nothing much ever changes. At least, not for the better. It is as if it hit its peak under the Third Republic and has been in decline ever since.
"France is almost a zombie country," we told a friend in the US. "Walking dead.
"Name a single French filmmaker of international status," we challenged her. "Or a composer? Or a musical group of any sort? Or a writer?
"Try to describe the latest 'french style' in furniture…or architecture…or anything else…
"French cuisine was developed long ago. When was the baguette invented? Or the croissant? Or soup a l'oignon? A long time ago. I don't know either, but it was probably before 1914. And French architecture? Paris was designed and built mostly in the second half of the 19th century. Most of what you see dates from that period. And the last notable developments in architecture were in the '20s - with art deco. In interior furnishings, there has been even less innovation. People decorate with Louis 15th or Louis 16th furniture…or California modern. Everything nowadays is imitation or derivative.
"And theatre? Entertainment? Paris had popular dance halls…Le Moulin Rouge…and the Follies Bergeres…a century ago. There were the bedroom farces of the '20s…but what after that? I don't know… Waiting for Godot - that was by an Irishman. Then, there are those '60s plays like The Flies and Deadend. But seem almost silly today. There may be good theatre in France, but it must not travel very well. It's not known outside of the country
"I already mentioned film…but what about philosophy? That's where the decline is perhaps most remarkable. In philosophy, the French started from a low point and worked their way down.
"At least French philosophy was popular in the '60s. People elsewhere tried to figure out what it was all about. Today, who cares?
"Now, few people can name anything at which the French are even close to leading the world - except public debt, where they're roughly tied with the US."
But what's this? France's leading TV philosopher - BHL, Bernard-Henri Levy - is back in the news. What, exactly, is his philosophy? Beats us. We actually met BHL 30 years ago. We tried to decipher what he was talking about then. We never did make sense of it.
In the three decades since, BHL went on to be a star. He's on TV. He writes book. He's married to a famous actress. And he still has his hair. We can forgive him many things; but not that. If we can't have hair, no man should be allowed to have it.
But he's one of the beautiful people - rich, talented, handsome and smart. More importantly, he's an activist!
Yes, dear reader, that is the depth to which French philosophy has fallen. Activism! Meddling! World improving! But BHL didn't get there on his own. Generations of French philosophers had to dig to get down that low.
We blame Descartes for putting in the first spade. "I think, therefore I am," may have solved an important problem for philosophers, but it led the whole trade in the wrong direction. Suppose he had thought he was an onion? Could you have made soup out of him? No, the whole enterprise of French philosophy was doomed from the get-go.
And it didn't get better. In modern times, Jean Paul Sartre gave out the word that a person had to meddle in order to exist. It was the difference between "being and nothingness." You had to be "engaged" in politics, he said. Naturally, he married himself to the marxists…and never recovered.
And now we have BHL on the front lines. According to the news reports, he hitched a ride on a vegetable truck to sneak across the Libyan border. Then, he arranged for a clandestine meeting with the rebels. His mission? Well, we don't know what his mission was. But if you believe the article in Le Point, he was serving the French government as a kind of minister sans papiers. Sarkozy invited him to meet the rebels. BHL met with them and concluded that they were freedom fighters - in need of the West's support. Soon, the French air force was dropping bombs on Libya…bringing the Americans into the war with them.
But why Libya? Why not go to war in some other country with a leader BHL doesn't like. BHL answers:
"It was an accident of history. I happened to be in Egypt when Gaddafi sent his planes to shoot at the pacifist demonstrations in Tripoli. It seemed to me such an enormous, unprecedented thing, and I felt the Egyptian democrats around me were so horrified by it that I decided on instinct to go to Libya straight away."

Paul Ryan doesn't think he'll be anyone's running mate in 2016
Hunter Walker and Shane Ferro
Feb. 13, 2015, 2:28 PM
Rep. Paul Ryan at an event on May 16, 2014.
Reuters
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) was the GOP's vice presidential candidate in 2012, but he doesn't think he'll be on the ticket in the next election.
After he became chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means committee last month, Ryan said he would not run for president in 2016. However, he did not rule out running for vice president.
At a question and answer session with reporters on Friday, Business Insider asked Ryan if would potentially consider being another candidate's running mate. Ryan indicated it's an unlikely possibility.
"That doesn't happen twice," Ryan said with a laugh. "I can't think of a time that's happened twice."
When Ryan ruled out running for president in 2016, he attributed the decision to a desire to focus on the Ways and Means committee.
"After giving it a lot of thought, I've decided not to run for president. Our work at the House Ways and Means Committee over the next few years will be crucial to moving America forward, and my job as Chairman deserves undivided attention," Ryan said.

Program Notes November 10: Shostakovich, Rachmaninoff, Sibelius
Written by csoadmin on October 29, 2018 . Posted in Blog. Leave a Comment
Shostakovich: Festive Overture (1954)
Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975)
The death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 brought an end to a period of severe artistic repression. Five years earlier a decree from the Central Committee accused many prominent Soviet composers, including Shostakovich and Prokofiev, of vaguely defined “anti-Soviet” tendencies. All these composers had their works banned and were forced to live hand-to-mouth, with the threat of imprisonment or worse hanging over their heads.
This decree was lifted too late for Prokofiev, who died on the same day as Stalin, but Shostakovich was able to take several works out of the drawer, including his Tenth Symphony, and arrange for their performance. At about this time, he received a commission for a new work to commemorate the 37th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. Festive Overture was the result. In contrast to much of Shostakovich’s music, the Overture is a work of unbridled merriment. The fact that Stalin was no longer breathing down his neck was surely a factor.
The Overture begins with a grandiose, quasi-ceremonial fanfare. The main body of the work is a lively sonata-form, apparently modeled on Glinka’s Overture to Russlan and Ludmilla. Near the end, the grandiose gesture returns (with optional additional brass). The infectious high sprits of the Overture have made it a popular concert work that is frequently performed all over the world.
Rachmaninoff: Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op. 43 (1934)
Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff (1873-1943)
Fleeing political instability in Russia and war in Europe, Rachmaninoff and his family arrived in New York in November 1918. Having left most of the family belongings and money behind, financial stability was Rachmaninoff’s most pressing need. Fortunately, he was well-known as one of the world’s greatest pianists, and the memory of his triumphant American tour in 1909-10 was still fresh. It didn’t take long for a busy performing career to be re-established.
His American years were sadly marked by a decrease in his composing. Rachmaninoff required quiet and isolation in order to work, and both were in short supply. From 1918 until his death 25 years later, he only completed six significant compositions and a handful of smaller works, mostly arrangements.
In 1932, Rachmaninoff purchased a villa near Lake Lucerne, Switzerland. He named it Villa Senar, after the first two letters of his and his wife’s names (Sergei and Natalia), and the first letter of their last name. It became their summer retreat, and with a haven to escape the pressures of his career, he began to think of composing again.
In 1934, during their third summer in Villa Senar, Rachmaninoff worked in secret on a new work for piano and orchestra. Late in August, as they were preparing to return to America, he wrote to a friend, “Two weeks ago I finished a new piece. It is called ‘Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra in the Form of Variations on a Theme of Paganini’ (the same theme on which Liszt and Brahms based their variations). It is very long, about 20 or 25 minutes — the length of a piano concerto! The composition is very difficult, and I should start practicing it, but with every year I become more lazy about this kind of fingerwork.”
Presumably, he made himself practice it. He premiered the new work (retitled simply Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini) on November 1934, with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. Though critical opinion was initially dismissive (as usual), it was immediately successful with the public, and is now considered one of Rachmaninoff’s greatest works.
Niccolò Paganini (1782-1840) was an Italian violinist whose virtuosity is still legendary, as is the rumor that he received his ability thanks to a pact with the Devil. The “theme of Paganini” used by Rachmaninoff is taken from the 24th Caprice for solo violin, itself a set of variations composed by Paganini in 1817. Numerous composers down to the present day (Wikipedia’s article on the 24th Caprice includes a list of over fifty composers who have written their own variations on it) have been intrigued by the tune.
A striking feature of Rachmaninoff’s work is the inclusion of a phrase from the Dies Irae plainchant, which is worked into several of the variations. The Dies Irae is taken from the traditional Requiem Mass, where it evokes the terrors of the Day of Judgement. In concert music of the 19th century, it had become a way of alluding to evil supernatural forces in general. Rachmaninoff inserted it by way of suggesting the violinist’s supposed demonic bargain, as he explained to the choreographer Michael Fokine a few years later when the two were discussing a possible ballet treatment. “Why not resurrect the legend of Paganini,” Rachmaninoff wrote, “who, for perfection in his art and the love of a woman, sold his soul to an evil spirit? All the variations which include the Dies Irae represent the evil spirit…Paganini himself first appears in the theme and again, now conquered, in Variation 23.” Fokine’s ballet Paganini, first performed with Rachmaninoff’s music in 1939, largely followed the composer’s ideas.
Although the work is not a concerto in the traditional sense, the grouping of the variations into three easily discernable sections does make at least a nod to three-movement concerto form. After a brief introduction and a variation in which the theme is heard in skeletal form, the theme proper is heard in the violins (with punctuations by the piano). The next several variations deal with the theme in various transformations, while the tempo gradually quickens. In Variation 7, as the tempo slows, the piano presents the Dies Irae theme while Paganini’s theme slithers through the bass instruments of the orchestra. The next three variations pick up the tempo again, at times suggesting a sinister march; finally all the energy dissipates, and there is a brief pause before the next section begins.
In this middle section, slow tempos predominate. Variation 11 is essentially an accompanied cadenza, leading into a slow minuet in which Paganini’s theme steps delicately as the piano plays a graceful adaptation of the Dies Irae theme. The pace once again speeds up, culminating in an extended brilliant passage for the piano alone. The tempo then slows, then slows again and again, before relaxing into Variation 18, arguably the most famous section of the piece. The piano unfolds one of those beautiful, lyrical, Romantic themes that are so typical of Rachmaninoff. At first hearing, it seems like a completely new idea, but it is nothing more than Paganini’s theme played much slower and inverted (played upside down), with little else changed.
The last section begins with a spiky treatment of the theme, obliterating the languid mood of the preceding section. Each of the next several variations ratchets up the pace and the tension level. After another cadenza, Variation 23 reintroduces the theme in something close to its original form. Yet another brief cadenza, and the final variation gets underway. As it draws to a close, the Dies Irae theme is heard one last time, and the music seems to push toward a typical grandiose conclusion, but ends unexpectedly in two whisper-soft chords.
Sibelius: Symphony No. 2 in D, Op. 43 (1901)
Jean Sibelius (1865-1957)
In 1907, a conducting engagement brought Gustav Mahler to Helsinki, where he met his fellow composer Jean Sibelius. As Sibelius later reported, the two met several times, and “thoroughly discussed all the great questions of music.” Eventually the subject of the symphony came up. Sibelius later recalled the conversation: “I said that I admired its severity of style and the profound logic that created an inner connection between the motifs … Mahler’s opinion was just the reverse. ‘No, the symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything!’”
Embracing an aesthetic outlook is one thing, putting it in practice another. While Sibelius’s symphonies are outstanding examples of formal logic and “severity of style,” does that necessarily mean that they are nothing more than pure form? Sibelius himself contradicted that notion when he described his symphonies as “confessions of faith from the different periods of my life,” and admitted that, “it pleases me greatly to be known as a poet of nature, for nature has truly been the book of books for me.”
Then, too, the political situation in Finland at the time almost guaranteed that his countrymen would read deeper meaning in his symphonies, whether Sibelius put them there intentionally or not. The Finland that Sibelius grew up in was ruled by czarist Russia, and for centuries before that had been under the political domination of Sweden. During all this time, the Finnish people longed for political independence, but it took a series of Russian decrees curtailing Finnish freedoms for a true independence movement to form.
Coinciding with the political movement came a cultural one. Interest in traditional Finnish art and customs began to take center stage in Finnish life. The ancient Finnish epic poem, the Kalevala, was widely discussed, and the Finnish language itself experienced a renaissance (most business in Finland had been conducted in Swedish). Sibelius was caught up in a younger generation of artists engaged in rediscovering their Finnish heritage.
The Second Symphony was written in 1901, shortly after his patriotic tone poem Finlandia, and shares much of that work’s musical language. Sibelius never articulated a definitive program for it, but it seems to be accepted that the first movement depicts the quiet pastoral life of the Finns; the second movement brings the ominous foreshadowing of foreign rule and oppression; the scherzo depicts the awakening of national resolve, and the Finale the coming of hope and deliverance.
It is interesting to note that the second movement began with a very different inspiration – a series of sketches for a proposed but never written tone poem on Don Juan. The sketches include a short program note that could easily be applied to the beginning of the second movement: “Sitting in the twilight in my castle. A stranger comes in. I ask him more than once who he is. Finally he strikes up a song. Then Don Juan sees who he is: Death.” A warm pianissimo string melody follows marked “Christus,” with no further explanation.
This begs the question: Did Sibelius intend the second movement as a musical depiction of a struggle between life (Christus) and death? Or is it simply that when he came to compose the second movement, he found this unused material, shorn of its original context, musically useful?
The first movement, marked Allegretto, begins with soft, pulsating chords in the strings, over which oboes and clarinets present a simple tune with the feeling of a folk dance. A pastoral feeling, tinged occasionally with melancholy, pervades the movement; passion and drama is avoided.
Drama makes itself heard in the second movement, Tempo andante ma rubato. It begins with low pizzicato strings (the footsteps of Death?), leading to a mournful lament for two bassoons. The tempo increases to Allegro as a feeling of struggle is heard, followed by the “Christus” theme in the strings. The remainder of the movement is dominated by lengthy buildups of tension, followed by abrupt cutoffs, finally ending with heavy triads.
The third movement, Vivacissimo, is in the nature of a Scherzo, though not actually labeled as one. The main part of the movement introduces several lively themes, while in the trio section the oboe introduces a more nostalgic theme, beginning with nine repetitions of the same note. The movement concludes with a long sequence on a three-note motive, which leads without a break into the Finale.
The last movement begins with a bold theme in the strings supported by heroic fanfares in the brass. Later, a second theme, heard over an endless ostinato in the lower instruments, introduces an uneasy note, but the symphony ends in a mood of optimism and triumph.
Finns have embraced the Second Symphony as an expression of patriotic sentiment, a “Liberation Symphony” as some have called it. Sibelius denied that this was his intent. Still, given the dramatic arc of the symphony, and the way that it mirrors his own countrymen’s aspirations, it appears that Sibelius’s embrace was wider than he realized.
Program Notes October 13

Prelude to Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (1861-1867)
Richard Wagner (1813-1883)
Throughout much of the 19th century, German music was dominated by a war of words between two opposing camps. On one side were the “neo-classicists” who championed formal clarity over emotional expression. On the other side was the so-called “New German School.” They felt that form must be subject to inspiration and favored an expansion of traditional harmonic language. By the 1860s, both camps had found their respective champions in Brahms and Wagner. It must be said that Brahms did little in the way of direct participation in the debate and in fact counted himself as an admirer of Wagner. It fell to the Viennese music critic Eduard Hanslick to become the most prominent voice of the neoclassical side of the debate. Wagner was more than willing to speak for himself, and in fact, he did so in a number of lengthy essays.
However, his best-known sally in the ongoing debate was certainly his music drama Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, first performed in 1868. Though billed as Wagner’s only comic opera (at least comic in a long-winded Wagnerian sense), Die Meistersinger can also be seen as an artistic manifesto. The plot concerns a song contest sponsored by the guild of Mastersingers in 16th century Nuremburg. The contest boils down to a struggle between two contestants, the newcomer Walther von Stolzing, and the narrow-minded Sextus Beckmesser. The latter’s song follows all the traditional rules laid down by the Mastersingers, and yet it is clearly inferior to Walter’s “Prize Song,” which boldly breaks them. It is almost universally assumed that the character Beckmesser is a thinly disguised caricature of Hanslick.
However, this assumption may be untrue or, at the least, wildly exaggerated. For one thing, Wagner had written a draft of the libretto as early as 1845 when Hanslick was unknown to him. For another, relations between the two men were friendly at first, before collapsing under the weight of their respective ideologies. The story may have been inadvertently begun by Wagner, who reported an incident at a reading of his libretto in 1862 while the opera was still in progress. By his account, Wagner believed that Hanslick was in some discomfort at the reading, and several of Wagner’s friends who were present got the impression that Hanslick saw the libretto as a personal attack. However, we have only Wagner’s word on this. The story has not been corroborated, even by Hanslick.
The Prelude to the opera was finished long before the opera itself and was first performed in 1862. In its broad outlines, the prelude resembles a traditional sonata form. The music begins with two themes associated with the Mastersinger’s guild. The first is a stately procession of the guildsmen, followed by the fanfare associated with the presentation of the guild’s banner. As the key changes, the violins present the third theme, a prototype version of Walther’s “Prize Song.” The development that follows includes a humorous passage in which the Mastersinger’s processional theme is presented by the winds in a mock-scholastic contrapuntal style, twice interrupted by the romantic Prize Song motive in the strings. Instead of a conventional recapitulation, in which the three main themes are played one after the other, Wagner does something totally new and presents all three themes simultaneously. The prelude concludes with a glorious affirmation of the Mastersinger themes.
Pavane, Op. 50 (1887)
Gabriel Fauré (1845-1924)
Though he was an important figure in the musical scene of late 19th-early 20th century France, Gabriel Fauré’s importance can be easy to overlook. The innovations of his contemporaries tended to emphasize more intense expression, longer forms, larger ensembles, ever more brilliant orchestral colors; qualities which are largely absent in Fauré’s music. His list of works consists mainly of chamber works and shorter pieces such as songs and piano music. He disliked flamboyant instrumental effects, considering them at best self-indulgent, or at worst a substitute for real musical invention. His masterpiece, the Requiem, distinguishes itself for its intimate expression, relative lack of drama, transparent orchestration, and above all its serenity, all hallmarks of Fauré’s mature style.
Despite his preference for smaller ensembles, Fauré did produce a number of orchestral works. One of his best-known is the Pavane, written in 1887 for a small orchestra consisting of woodwinds and horns in pairs, plus the usual strings. A Pavane is a slow, elegant and stately dance from the Renaissance era, originating in Italy but mainly associated with Spain. The work was originally written for a summer concert series of lighter works, but the premiere took place in November 1888.
At about the same time, Fauré began to frequent the salon of Élisabeth de Caraman Chimay, Countess Greffulhe, a leading Parisian patroness of the arts. The composer chose to dedicate the work to her. She raised the idea that the work be performed as a short ballet, but also suggested that a part for chorus be added. Fauré obliged her, adding a choral setting of a rather insipid text by the Countess’s nephew on top of the preexisting orchestral parts. The version with chorus and
dancers was first performed in 1991 at one of the Countess’s garden parties. The published score included the choral parts. However, since the chorus was simply overlaid onto an already complete composition, and contributed nothing essential, it is common to simply perform it with orchestra alone.
Fauré considered the Pavane “elegant but not particularly important;” still, it has become one of his most familiar compositions. The reasons for its appeal are obvious. The opening flute melody is haunting and easily memorable, but the simplicity of the texture is offset by Fauré’s genius for introducing unexpected harmonic twists, keeping the texture from being overly predictable. The choreographer Léonide Massine heard “haunting echoes of Spain’s Golden Age,” which brought to mind the formality and underlying melancholy he found in the paintings of Velázquez. Two decades later, nearly identical terms would be used to describe the Pavane for a Dead Princess by Maurice Ravel, Fauré’s most distinguished pupil.
Romanian Rhapsody No. 1, in A Major, Op. 11 (1901)
George Enescu (1881-1955)
Romanian violinist and composer, George Enescu was a child prodigy. He entered the Vienna Conservatory at age seven and graduated at age 12 with a silver medal. After further study in Paris, he began a career as a violinist and chamber musician in Europe. Later he began a second career as a conductor in the United States. He died in Paris in 1955. There are only 33 published works by Enescu. His busy career as a performer is often blamed, but his relentless perfectionism is probably the real reason. All of his published works were repeatedly revised before publication, and in many cases revision continued even after publication. Recent research suggests that there may be hundreds of compositions in manuscript that Enescu simply could not polish to the high standards of perfection he demanded for publication. Enescu reflected on his music, “People have been puzzled and annoyed because they have been unable to catalogue and classify me in the usual way. They could not decide exactly what type of music mine was. It was not French after the manner of Debussy; it was not exactly German … people are annoyed when they cannot readily classify one.” The fact that Enescu made use of Romanian folk idioms in his earlier works would tend to classify him as a nationalist; however, shortly after the publication of his two Romanian Rhapsodies, he began to move away from the overt use of folk materials. He disliked the limitations it placed on his creativity. He came to bitterly resent the popularity of the Rhapsodies and the way they dominated his reputation. The Rhapsodies, dominated by brilliant, virtuosic writing for the violin sections, remain as popular today as ever.
Symphony No. 5 in E minor, Op. 64 (1888)
Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893)
Creative people are often susceptible to periods of depression and self-doubt. Tchaikovsky struggled with such periods throughout his life, but the 1870s were an especially difficult. Spectacular successes were followed by equally spectacular failures, with some of the failures existing only in his mind. The decade also encompassed his disastrous marriage, stemming from a desperate attempt to deny his homosexuality, followed by a halfhearted suicide attempt. Professionally, however, 1878 was a banner year, with the completion of three of his greatest works, the Violin Concerto, Fourth Symphony, and the opera Eugene Onegin. But the emotional and professional upheavals of his life had taken a toll, and he entered a period of creative exhaustion. For several years, the flood of works from his pen slowed to a trickle.
The idea for a Fifth Symphony seems to have occurred in early 1888. Ten years had passed since had passed since the composition of his fourth symphony. Tchaikovsky’s letters reveal his fears that he was “dried up” and “written out,” but he was not ready to give up just yet. A letter to his brother, dated May 27, included the news that he was “hoping to collect, little by little, material for a symphony.” A few weeks later he wrote, “Now I shall work my hardest.I am exceedingly anxious to prove to myself, as to others, that I am not played out as a composer … The beginning was difficult, but now inspiration seems to have come.”
Once inspiration came, Tchaikovsky, as usual, was able to work very quickly. A sketch of the symphony was finished within six weeks, with the full score being completed quickly. Tchaikovsky was decidedly pleased with the effort: “I have not blundered, it has turned out well,” he wrote. Unfortunately, his reaction to the November premiere in St. Petersburg revealed that he had not overcome his tendency toward self-doubt. “I have come to the conclusion,” he wrote, “that it is a failure. There is something repellent, something superfluous, patchy and insecure, which the public instinctively recognizes. It was obvious to me that the ovations I received were prompted more by my earlier work, and that the Symphony itself did not really please the audience. This realization brings a sharp twinge of dissatisfaction with myself. Am I really played out, as they say?”
It took a performance in Hamburg the following year to finally bring him around. The orchestra was much better prepared than at the St. Petersburg performance, and the new symphony was enthusiastically received by both the audience and critics. Even Brahms, who loathed Tchaikovsky, was less critical than usual. “The Fifth Symphony was magnificently played,” Tchaikovsky reported, “and I like it far better now.” A striking feature of the symphony, and a unique one for Tchaikovsky, is the use of a “motto,” a theme which recurs in various transformations in every movement of the symphony. Tchaikovsky’s sketches include a marginal note that gives this theme a tantalizing significance: “Introduction. Complete resignation before Fate, or, which is the same, before the inscrutable predestination of Providence. Allegro. (1) Murmurs of doubt, complaints, reproaches against XXX. (2) Shall I throw myself in the embraces of faith??? A wonderful program, if only it can be carried out.”
This is the only apparent clue to a possible program for the symphony, but there is no indication that it was “carried out” any further. It seems reasonable to describe the recurring theme as a “Fate motive,” as almost all commentators do. It is heard at the beginning in a foreboding, apprehensive mood. It recurs in the second movement as a brutal interruption of a moment of heartfelt expression. We hear it again near the end of the third movement as a ghostly presence hovering around the edges of a waltz tune, and in the finale as the subject of a ceremonial march. Tchaikovsky left us a detailed program for the Fourth Symphony, revolving around man’s struggle with Fate, but with the Fifth we have nothing to go on. Perhaps it would be best to “Let him guess it who can,” as Tchaikovsky would suggest in connection with his next, and last, symphony.
The symphony begins with a slow introduction, including a single statement of the Fate theme by two clarinets in unison in their low register, simply accompanied by low strings. The mood is somber, gray and colorless. The first movement proper gets under way as the tempo quickens, and clarinet and bassoon introduce a theme which, while still somber, has an infectious rhythmic lilt. The theme builds to a rousing climax, and is followed by a complete contrast, one of those tender, yearning themes in the strings which Tchaikovsky does so well. The development section is extended and complex, described by Edward Downs as “a battlefield of rhythms and sonorities.” Both themes are heard, often in combination. A solo bassoon introduces the recapitulation, which is fairly straightforward, but is followed by a long coda which builds to a brilliant climax, only to sink away to an e-minor triad, unusually voiced in the lowest register of the orchestra.
The second movement again begins with somber, low chords, which suddenly give way to a gorgeous, romantic theme in the solo horn. Lovely as this theme is, it has a strange, unfinished quality to it. The theme it never really comes to a proper conclusion but always gives way to a secondary theme which turns out to be the more important of the two. This is a movement built around long buildups to ever larger climaxes, which tend to be wiped out by unexpected reappearances of the Fate motive, until the movement finally comes to an end in a mood of resigned contentment.
As an antidote to the intense heat of the second movement, something cooler, was needed. Tchaikovsky supplied with a Waltz in place of the traditional Scherzo. The principal theme is based on a tune he heard sung by a Florentine street urchin during a trip to Italy several years earlier. This is not music of deep emotion, but there is a sense of melancholy which is never entirely absent. After a lighter, almost Mendelssohn like trio, the principal theme returns, and the Fate motive makes a brief but unmistakable appearance just before the end.
The Finale is long, formally complex, and draining. Few symphonic movements are as exhausting, for both performer and listener as this. The Fate motive is heard at the outset, now in a major key and cast as a stately, triumphant processional. The main body of the movement gets underway with a sudden quickening of tempo and a return to the minor mode. What follows is a normal sonata form with two contrasting themes and a development section that treats both themes and the Fate motive. Despite the normality of its form, this is music of unrelenting momentum. Buildups are followed by bigger buildups, climaxes by greater climaxes, until a series of emphatic major triads is followed by a sudden silence. At this point a sizable portion of the audience begins applauding, being fooled into thinking the symphony is over. Tchaikovsky, however, has one more surprise. The Fate motive is heard a final time, now transformed into a grandiose march of triumph. A Presto coda follows, featuring several more long buildups, until the symphony finally ends with trumpets, quadruple fortissimo, recalling he principal theme of the first movement, bringing the symphony full circle.
History of Clapping
Written by Jennifer Lear on October 8, 2018 . Posted in Blog. Leave a Comment
One of the first things many of us learn to do as babies is clap. As we age, we learn that clapping is an acceptable way to show appreciation and happiness. We clap at a sporting event when our team scores. We clap at a political rally when a speaker makes a point we appreciate. We clap at a popular music concert when our favorite artist plays a great song. But sometimes it can be confusing as to when clapping is appropriate.
History of Clapping
For instance, does one clap when Hamlet finishes his soliloquy in a modern Shakespearean performance? And at what point should one clap at the symphony? And where is the line between a small, polite clap and a roaring applause complete with hoots and hollers? Here at Carmel Symphony Orchestra (CSO), we understand these can be difficult distinctions and the worry of doing the wrong thing might deter our audience members from fully enjoying their experience. Today we’d like to take a moment to explore the history of applause, and help you better understand how and when to clap at one of our performances.
The exact beginning of applause is a little uncertain, but we know it was first documented in the third century B.C., with the works of Roman playwright Plautus ending with the word plaudite, a directive for the audience to applaud or clap. A performer would announce to the audience at the end that it was time to applaud. Applauding consisted of hand clapping and finger snapping.As time passed, the practice followed into politics. In first century A.D. and beyond, audience members would clap for politicians speaking in the theater. These politicians would gauge their popularity based on how much applause they and their opponent received.
Over time applause evolved from sedate hand clapping and finger snapping to include stomping, trilling, and chants of praise. It was not uncommon for a performer during Roman times to employ the service of a claque, a group of paid audience members who would cheer and clap, to motivate the rest of the audience to applaud. Think of the modern-day sitcom laugh track. These people would manipulate the general audience by their paid reactions. This practice went on to become a standard in French theater and opera in the seventeenth and eighteen centuries.
Later in the eighteenth century, artists such as Mozart expected people to be loud at his performances. Not only was applause and cheering encouraged and appreciated, but concerts were seen as a social gathering. Friends would chat and even eat while an artist performed. However, these performances were more intimate and often commissioned by the host as entertainment for their dinner party.
Over the next hundred years, orchestral concerts became more of what they are today, larger gatherings of the general public. With more people and louder sounds, some artists became frustrated and distracted by the cheers and applause. Others demanded no applause during performances as a way to discourage claques. Now that the masses were able to attend performances, the social elite began to stay quiet and reserved as a way to distinguish themselves from the lower classes in attendance.
When is clapping appropriate?
This reserved attitude became the standard for orchestral performances from that point into modern times. However, we at Carmel Symphony Orchestra believe music is a thing to be felt, loved, and enjoyed. A trip to the symphony does not need to be a stuffy experience. Just as you are no longer expected to wear frock coats or corsets (though, if that’s what makes you feel comfortable we have no problem with it!), you no longer should feel the need to stifle your appreciation. Let’s take a cue from the Romans. If you feel moved by the music, let us know!
Cheers, clapping, finger snapping, whatever you’d like! We encourage you to enjoy yourself and feel comfortable when you are at a Carmel Symphony Orchestra performance.

The Truth About Human Trafficking With Kathy Bryan

You probably walked the same way when you were a child. Every day, 15-year-old Kathy walked less than a mile to a friend's house after school. That's how she met her trafficker.

What started at that moment led to years' worth of trafficking that happened right under her parents' nose. Until the Holy Spirit set her free. Listen to the podcast to hear how.

Art Institute scales down addition plan - Chicago Tribune

Art Institute scales down addition plan
Blair Kamin, Tribune architecture criticCHICAGO TRIBUNE
The Art Institute of Chicago on Tuesday unveiled a slimmed-down version of its planned $200 million addition across the street from Millennium Park, and museum president James Wood predicted the delayed project would be built despite the sagging economy.
"I am confident. The board is confident," Wood said after he and Italian architect Renzo Piano showed reporters the plans. The museum's trustees, who are expected to provide major financial support, were to see the plans later Tuesday.
Announced last year, the Piano-designed expansion calls for a modern structure of steel, glass and limestone to be built at the southwest corner of Columbus and Monroe Drives. It will provide a second major entrance for the museum, complementing the Art Institute's Michigan Avenue entry.
An overhanging glass roof Piano has likened to a flying carpet will top the five-level addition, with three levels above ground and two below.
The Tribune reported in July that the opening of the expansion, the museum's first major addition since the neo-classical Rice Building of 1988, had been pushed back to 2007 instead of 2005 or 2006. Wood, who attributed the delay to the desire to solve functional and aesthetic problems, said Tuesday that the opening now could occur in 2007 or 2008 and that groundbreaking might be in 2004 instead of 2003.
Among other changes:
The addition will be 255,000 square feet, a 35,000-square-foot drop in size. Piano made the reductions, done to keep the building's cost at $200 million, mostly by finding a way to trim space for ducts and other mechanical equipment. His plan still calls for 75,000 square feet of galleries, housing classic modern work to contemporary art, on the building's top two floors.
Originally, Piano envisioned a curving steel bridge that would enable pedestrians to avoid busy Monroe Drive as they walked from the Frank Gehry-designed bandshell in Millennium Park to the new building. Piano now wants a street-level steel and glass canopy to span Monroe, saying a covered pathway would get more use and be less visually cumbersome than the bridge. Museum officials later this week are to discuss with city officials that idea, which could require adjustments to nearby traffic lights.
The new plan eliminates gardens that were to be built on a deck over the railroad tracks, extending the Millennium Park greensward about 40 feet south of Monroe. Museum officials said the gardens were dropped because the city's new long-range central area plan calls for extending an underground CTA bus route to the spot where the deck would go.
A cafe planned for the addition's upper level will be built along Monroe to provide more activity at street level.
The height of the 300-foot-long atrium that will lead southward from the new building's Monroe entrance to the Rice Building was cut to 50 feet from about 60 feet, yielding better proportions, Piano said.

Prairie View physicist's experiment endangered
Physicist's experiment endangered
Flap could backfire on black students
ERIC BERGER, Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Science Writer
Published 5:30 am CDT, Saturday, July 28, 2001
A collision with his university's president may force a Prairie View A&M physicist to halt work on a prestigious atom-smashing experiment and, ultimately, leave a job in which he has inspired perhaps the rarest of all scientists -- the black physicist.
Each year, an average of just eight black U.S. students graduate with Ph.D.s. In the last seven years, six of Dennis Judd's undergraduate students have gone on to earn physics doctorates.
He has succeeded in this, his students say, by showing them how particle physics is done, not telling.
Grants Judd has received from the U.S. Department of Energy have allowed his students to work on experiments at the nation's premiere high energy physics labs, including Fermi National Accelerator Lab in Batavia, Ill., and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Menlo Park, Calif.
"Even if you don't like Dennis Judd, you have to admit he's had a very different and positive effect on helping to produce black physicists," said one of his former students, Byron Freelon, now a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif.
"To have six come out in less than a decade is, to be honest, amazing."
But Judd's future at the university is threatened. Even as sponsored research awards to Prairie View faculty have sharply declined, President Charles Hines appears to be blocking funding Judd needs to continue experimenting, for reasons the professor believes are related to his past criticisms of the president, not sound reasoning.
Most recently Judd's team has participated in the BaBar experiment at the Stanford accelerator that just three weeks ago reported a heralded advance in understanding the behavior of matter and antimatter.
"The group has been a valuable component of the collaboration," said Stewart Smith, a Princeton physicist who speaks for the BaBar experiment. "They have worked hard."
The Prairie View team and a group from the University of Texas-Dallas are the state's only researchers among 600 scientists working on the experiment.
On May 1, the Department of Energy approved a $673,000 peer-reviewed grant that will allow Judd, four other Prairie View researchers and his students to continue work on the BaBar experiment for three more years.
Yet Hines still must sign off on the grant before Judd can have access to the money that pays salaries and travel costs to and from the California experiment site for several researchers.
Hines declined to be interviewed for this article. Instead, his office released a statement Friday saying several regulatory and procedural issues remained undecided.
"Hopefully, the management review and all associated issues will be resolved within the next two weeks," Hines said. "However, until all issues are resolved, a decision is not possible."
Judd dismissed the president's management review as "litigious nonsense." A letter from Hines to Judd dated May 31 also promises a decision on the grant within two weeks.
The key point of contention centers upon Margaret Haire, a research associate on Judd's team whose salary has been paid by DOE grants for a decade.
Although there are no hard-and-fast rules, research associates like Haire are supposed to devote their full-time efforts to the experiment, which means no teaching responsibilities.
Haire, according to Judd, "assisted" in a geology lab taught by another Prairie View faculty member. Haire was not the lab's teacher of record, and Judd says her teaching role is a common practice by research associates funded by DOE grants.
Hines' deliberations, Judd says, are simply a vindictive stalling effort in response to the four years, ending earlier this year, Judd spent as vice speaker of Prairie View's faculty senate. And Judd says Hines is using Haire's teaching role as an excuse to hold up the grant.
During his faculty senate years, as research grants to the university dropped from $18.7 million in 1995 to $6.3 million in 1998, Judd and other faculty members repeatedly criticized Hines, a retired Army major general, as insensitive to their academic needs. There was even talk of a vote of no-confidence in Hines, although it never materialized.
Presidents at Texas A&M system campuses have full control over grant approvals, and the system will not intervene, said Jerry Gaston, the system's vice chancellor. A DOE spokeswoman said the dispute is a matter for the university to decide.
With the new grant left unsigned, Judd's research team has not been paid since May. Nor has it been able to travel to California for the experiment. The team, Judd says, will have to resign from the collaboration if Hines fails to sign the grant soon.
That might prompt Judd to leave Prairie View.
"I don't understand why the president would want to hurt a faculty member doing a good job," Judd said. "Why would he want to push me away?"
As a black physicist, especially one who served on the state's blue-ribbon panel to dismantle the Superconducting Super Collider with others such as Norman Hackerman, the president emeritus of Rice University, Judd likely would not have trouble getting another local job.
According to the American Institute of Physics, over the last 27 years just 220 doctorates in physics have been awarded to blacks in the United States. At Fermilab, only one of the lab's 300 staff physicists is black.
It was two summer's worth of experience at the Stanford accelerator that pushed Clayton Simien, another Judd student, to work toward a Ph.D. in physics. As a result of his undergraduate work, Simien obtained a $100,000 fellowship from Hewlett-Packard for his graduate studies.
"I was able to see research performed, see how research is done, interact with other students doing research," said Simien. "It revolutionized the way I thought."
Simien helped build detectors at the accelerator for the BaBar experiment. Ultimately, they were used to study the high-energy collisions in which exotic, subatomic particles are created for just trillionths of seconds before they decay.
Scientists were seeking to answer a simple question: Why isn't the universe a void?
Researchers believe equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created during the Big Bang some 13 million years ago, when the universe formed. If matter and antimatter collide they annihilate each other.
Because there is virtually no antimatter in the universe today, and lots of matter in the form of stars, galaxies, planets and people, scientists believe antimatter "decays" more quickly than regular matter.
By smashing particles such as protons and electrons together at very high speeds and energies, scientists can recreate conditions similar to those when the universe was formed, and thus observe antimatter.
In their decades of looking for antimatter that decays quickly, however, physicists had found only one particle, called a kaon, whose antimatter counterpart decayed faster. The particle, detected in 1964, won its discovers a Nobel Prize.
The BaBar experiment found a second such particle, a "B" meson, that showed similar properties. The result has bolstered physicists' understanding of the complex, often bizarre workings of matter's tiniest constituents.
"This is an intriguing experiment that I would like to continue to work on," Judd said. "I think it's good for Prairie View to be represented on a project like this."

Toxic seepage causing concern in S.E. Harris County
EPA sees no health threat despite chemicals in groundwater

Dangerous chemicals contained at the Brio Superfund site in southeast Harris County have seeped into deep ground­water, prompting concern from authorities, although officials say there is no immediate danger.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 1,2–dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, both of which can be toxic to humans, have somehow seeped to a level deeper than the level at which they were thought to be contained.
The EPA says the unexpected seepage isn't threatening to humans unless the chemicals get into drinking water or into the air, which hasn't yet happened. There are no drinking water wells around Brio and the groundwater is moving slowly, the government said.
“We do not believe there are any health threats as a result of this,” said Gary Miller, an EPA project manager who works at the site.
Miller said it's unclear how the seepage happened, although it appears to have been going on since 2007. In the past year, however, the levels of the chemicals have exceeded those mandated by the federal government, he said. It was first noticed through regular monitoring at the site.
The next steps are to continue to sample the levels of chemicals and then develop a plan to clean them, Miller said. It's impossible to say how the problem will be fixed because officials are still studying how big it is, he said.
Community activist Marie Flickinger, who long fought for Brio to be cleaned up, expressed concern Friday but said she felt the government was acting appropriately.
“They've got to look at it and figure out what's going on,” Flickinger said. “But they're doing what's required, and even more than that, and they're being open and up-front about it.”
Brio, which once housed waste disposal sites, has been on the federal government's Superfund list of the worst toxic waste sites in the country since 1989.
Residents in the area have blamed Brio for a range of health problems, including birth defects. A school and housing subdivision had to be demolished as a result of their proximity to the site.
In 2003, officials announced pollution at the 59-acre location had been contained after four years and $100 million. The containment includes a massive layer of clay tied to a barrier wall underground that wraps around the site.
There's also a “lid” covering Brio that includes a gas collection system, a flexible membrane and a vegetative cover.

Blinebury: Longhorns older, wiser in ways of Tournament
FRAN BLINEBURY, Copyright 2003 Houston Chronicle
Published 5:30 am CST, Monday, March 24, 2003
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- When the NCAA selection committee came out of its huddle a week earlier, Texas' road to the Final Four couldn't have looked like a smoother ride unless it came in a stretch limousine.
Toss in mink seat covers, a top-of-the-line sound system and a few platters of tasty hors d'oeuvres, and you'd have a party on wheels that could compare to the Longhorns getting to spend the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament in the regional finals in San Antonio.
But with just a few ticks left on the first-half clock Sunday, Brandon McKnight flipped the ball ahead to Willie Deane, who banked in a running 3-pointer that came clearly after the horn sounded to send Purdue running off the floor with the lead. Suddenly, Texas might have been on an entirely different kind of path.
The road to perdition.
"You find a way to win," said T.J. Ford after he pulled out the map in the second half and steered the Horns to their 77-67 win. "There are always going to be games when your shot's not going down, when the things you usually do just don't happen for one reason or another. What you've got to do in those situations is go to your defense and depend on each other."
In a way, this opening weekend might have been a bit of a trap waiting to slam its jaws shut on the Longhorns. Or, at the very least, a test to see if they were ready to take the step up to the level of national championship contenders.
Texas entered the Tournament as a No. 1 seed for the first time ever and was trying to win its opening two games and reach the Sweet 16 in back-to-back seasons for the first time in school history.
It wasn't a question of whether the Longhorns were the most talented team in their "pod" here in the middle of sweet home Alabama, but whether they could deal with being one of the teams in the cross hairs.
As coach Rick Barnes observed, with seemingly every man, woman and child from coast to coast filling out brackets and trying to pick the upsets, there is a lot of rooting for the lower-seeded teams in every arena.
"Everybody likes those dark jerseys," he said.
And every higher seed in a set of white jerseys can turn on the TV any time and see the giants falling. No. 1 Arizona sweated through two overtimes to survive Gonzaga. Two No. 2s, Wake Forest and Florida, are gone. All of the No. 4s have disappeared, including Louisville to a barrage of 3-pointers from 12th-seeded Butler just prior to the Longhorns' stepping onto the same floor.
It can happen to the best of them. It does every year.
So there was Texas struggling to get into a flow. There was Ford, to many eyes the best player in the nation, struggling to find a rhythm as he missed seven of his first nine shots and had twice as many turnovers (four) as assists in the first half. And there was Deane's running, late heave giving the Longhorns a reason to gripe and lose their focus through the intermission as they trailed 31-30, if they were so inclined.
Not that Texas didn't have grounds to grumble. What in the name of the all-knowing Billy Packer and Dick Vitale was going on here?
According to NCAA rules, the referees are permitted to consult television replays to determine if a shot beat the clock at the end of a game but not at the end of the first half. Why not? It's more than March madness; it's sheer insanity.
In the NBA, plays at the end of every quarter are reviewable by video. Of course. What if Purdue had won by one point or two? All that can be affected is the outcome of a game. Or a national title.
"All three referees came out before the second half and told me, `Rick, we're sorry we kicked that call,' " Barnes said. " `Now let's try to go on from here.' "
Sure, and tell Mrs. Lincoln to enjoy the rest of the play.
To the Longhorns' credit, they did not let that one play fester or distract them from the task at hand. They employed a great deal of zone defense to protect Ford from foul trouble and keep him rested. Royal Ivey played ferocious defense in harassing Deane to 4-for-17 shooting on the day. Deginald Erskin came off the bench to provide a big lift with his interior offense. And Ford turned up the pressure by attacking the basket, converting drives and making free throws to finish with 21 points and eight assists.
Now the Longhorns move on to face Connecticut, a No. 5 seed. Awaiting in a possible second game at the Alamodome on Sunday will be the winner of No. 6 Maryland vs. No. 7 Michigan State. That's three of the last four champions.
Maybe things get tougher in terms of the opponents, but now the potholes and pitfalls are more visible.
"We'll be at home in Texas, we'll have our crowd backing us, and we've got two games under our belts," James Thomas said.
For the Longhorns, it was a weekend merely about surviving the road less traveled.

Arctic Ice Extent Recovering At Record Pace
https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2016/09/29/arctic-ice-extent-recovering-at-record-pace/
By Paul Homewood http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/icethickness/thk.uk.php Arctic sea ice continues to grow back at a phenomenal rate. Since the start of the month, growth has comfortable exceeded anything on record since daily figures began in 1987. ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/ Ice has expanded by 0.896 million sq km, compared to the 1981-2010 average of 0.237 million sq km. According to NSIDC, ice extent now stands at the fourth highest for this day in the last 10 years. ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/ DMI actually show ice extent to be higher than NSIDC, roughly equal to 2013 and 2014, which raises questions in itself. http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/icecover.uk.php DMI now estimate that the average extent for the month will be greater than, or on a par with, most of the last ten years. Only 2013 and 2014 are much greater. It is clear that September ice extent has remained extremely stable since 2007, regardless of what happened before. http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/icecover_30y.uk.php

Got spam? Ask JCPenney.com
Brian Livingston warns you might soon be deluged by a torrent of corporate spams featuring a roster of companies you've likely patronized as a paying customer.
January 12, 2002 4:32 PM PST
JCPenney.com is one of the worst purveyors of "corporate spam" and makes it difficult for recipients to stem the tide, according to an e-commerce study.
SimplyQuick, a consumer service that tests Web shopping sites, criticizes JCPenney and seven other top e-tailers as offenders in a study of corporate spam.
In an interview, SimplyQuick's CEO, Simon Smelt, said his service began the study in December 2000 by subscribing to e-mail newsletters from 41 top shopping sites. He submitted a different e-mail address to each e-tailer for tracking purposes. He then "unsubscribed" from each list after receiving a company's first e-mail.
The study bent over backward to avoid crying "spam." Noting that some sites ask for three days to process requests, Smelt said that any e-mails received within four days of an unsubscribe command were deemed acceptable.
Most of the e-tailers passed the unsubscribe test with flying colors. But eight of the shopping sites continued to send unwanted e-mails. In response, the study group made a new unsubscribe request after receiving each unsought message.
JCPenney was named the worst offender among the eight corporate miscreants because it sent the greatest number of unwanted e-mails. The company had sent the test address four advertising messages by March 2001, even after repeated unsubscribe requests, Smelt said. And the messages were hefty graphical downloads containing numerous pictures.
Asked about the study, Betty Hinds, a human resources executive for JCPenney's information technology department, said, "Apparently someone isn't doing their job. There should be a person taking care of the Web site at all times to add and subtract names, and if you don't want to get e-mails from us any more, then you shouldn't have to."
Corporate spam differs from the typical spam that Internet users often receive. Typical spam messages tend to promote get-rich-quick schemes and adult entertainment. The messages originate from companies you've never heard of and usually contain false return addresses.
Corporate spam messages, by contrast, bear the names of well-known industry leaders. This makes it difficult to stop corporate spam using "spam filters." Using a filter to block all e-mails from such large companies could interfere with important business dealings.
Since corporations are free to hold any opinions they like and may send e-mail to anyone who asks, freedom of speech is not at stake in prohibiting corporate spam. If unsolicited corporate e-mail becomes more widely accepted, on the other hand, a torrent could be unleashed.
There are 12 million businesses in the United States alone, according to ListBazaar , a database company. If each business sent you just one e-mail per year, your inbox would receive over 32,000 messages a day. And something tells me that most businesses wouldn't limit themselves to only one message per year.
Unsolicited commercial faxes are prohibited in the United States and several other countries, because fax recipients must pay for each printed page. But laws against unsolicited e-mails are spotty, although each e-mail, like a fax, costs the recipient money. The cost of delivery is built into flat-rate Internet service, and many Internet users in small towns, hotel rooms, and areas outside the United States must pay by the minute to download e-mail.
A few battles against corporate spam, however, have been won. A California professor last week used that state's anti-spamming laws to obtain a $77.50 court judgment against Kozmo.com, although the newly deceased shopping site may never pay up.
Kozmo's customer service number provided only a recorded message, and an e-mail request for comment went unanswered.
SimplyQuick's Smelt warns that some corporate sites are treading a fine line. Smelt, who holds a Ph.D. in economics from London University, says several corporations do honor unsubscribe requests but impose complex procedures to discourage unsubscribing.
Getting sales alerts by e-mail should be a consumer convenience. Unfortunately, subscribing at some corporate sites will get you more than you bargained for.

MobileMe: "Exchange for the rest of us"; $99 a year
MobileMe: "Exchange for the rest of us"; $99 a year
by
Ben Wilson
December 5, 2008 3:43 PM PST
Apple today announced "MobileMe," a new service that syncs email, contacts and calendar appointments and other data across devices including iPhones and Macs.
If, for instance, you take a picture on your iPhone and push it to MobileMe, the photo becomes instantly accessible through your online photo album and is subsequently pushed to all target devices.
The service is priced at $99 per year, and replaces Apple's .Mac. There will be a 60-day free trial launched alongside iPhone OS 2.0.

When Woz personally delivers your Apple computer
Just posted to YouTube is a video of Steve Wozniak delivering a young girl's surprise iMac, because, well, surprise. Woz also admits that he sometimes calls people pretending to be Apple customer support, just for the fun of it.

Not quite Santa Claus, but close. Game Informer/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET
I'm not sure I'd like a strange old man with a gray beard and a white suit delivering my KFC.
I also don't know how I'd feel if the haunting features of Keith Olbermann suddenly appeared to plug in my cable service.
Somehow, though, the sight of Steve Wozniak turning up at your door to say "Hey, here's a new iMac for you" might be rather charming.
And, in real life, it is.
I am grateful to Gizmodo for spotting some recently posted footage of Woz and his wife, Janet, turning up to surprise a young girl.
Posted to YouTube by someone with the charming moniker Buster Doggboye, the footage -- taken a few years ago -- shows Woz and his wife turning up at the door of Emma and her family, with large iMac box in tow.
Emma's dad explains that he posted the video with Woz's permission and that it seemed like " having your lightbulbs delivered by Thomas Edison."

Emma and her sister Elizabeth were both "Apple fankids," a new sub-sect of the Apple faithful. Their friends, said dad, only knew him from "Dancing With The Stars. Oh, he left his mark all over the dance floor.
Having delivered the iMac to a delirious Emma, he was kind enough not to leave Elizabeth out -- she got an iPod Touch.
Woz explained to Gizmodo: "An email-only acquaintance, Peter Fraser, came up with the idea and asked if I'd do it. I met him around the block to get the computer from him. After a short wait I drove to his house and surprised his daughter. But I had to keep driving to Tahoe that evening."
Woz also admitted that when he meets people during personal appearances, he sometimes take the phone numbers of their loved ones and then calls them up, pretending to be Apple support.
He explained: "It's like a satisfaction survey. I either give my name early on or later and I ask the questions straight-faced, like I really do it for Apple."
I wonder how many complaints he gets.

The Good Good build quality and finish; fairly inexpensive.
The Bad Poor-quality lens; low-resolution continuous-shutter mode; no zooming while shooting movies; awkward controller.
The Bottom Line Either our Exilim EX-Z90 had a duff lens or Casio's spending too much on gadgets and not enough on glassware. The 'continuous shutter' tech in this camera is barely related to the real thing in Casio's high-speed models. Overall, it's a very disappointing camera

Casio Exilim EX-Z90
The 12.1-megapixel Exilim EX-Z90 compact camera with 3x zoom offers a 'dynamic photo' mode, Casio's 'continuous shutter' technology and an intelligent autofocus system that can work out what to focus on and how to adjust the exposure to match. It's all wrapped up in a neat little metal body. That doesn't look like too bad a deal for around £150.
Baffling autofocus
This intelligent autofocus isn't so easy to figure out, though. What is it actually doing? According to the blurb, it recognises all sorts of different subjects -- not just human faces. Sure enough, when this mode's switched on, the camera's AF markers dart around the scene and pick out different subjects according to where you point the camera. Why? What has it 'recognised'? Is it what you wanted? It could well be clever, but it's hard to be sure without knowing what it's doing, why and whether it's making any difference.
At its minimum focal length, the EX-Z90's lens does a decent-enough job. Colours are good, exposures are fine and the high-ISO quality's not bad for a compact, either (click image to enlarge)
Casio's also enhanced its dynamic-photo mode. With this, you can shoot a moving subject and get the camera to extract it from its background and place it against a new one. Previously, you had to shoot two photos, with one being just the background on its own. Now, as long as the background has a plain, even tone you only have to shoot one. You get a collection of 'dynamic photo' images on a CD in the box, too.
The dynamic-photo mode has some novelty value, as has the 'make-up' mode, activated via a menu at the bottom of the on-screen control panel. This adjusts the focus and exposure, smoothes skin and softens shadows.

In Age of Trump, Scientists Show Signs of a Political Pulse [New York Times]
Home »News»Story
Jump to more in News
As the Trump administration pushes climate science out of the spotlight, scientists such as Jacquelyn Gill ’05 prepare to throw their hats into the political ring.
BY AMY HARMON AND HENRY FOUNTAIN VIA THE NEW YORK TIMES
Jacquelyn Gill '05 holds a joint appointment at the Climate Change Institute and the School of Biology and Ecology at The University of Maine.
Michael Eisen, an evolutionary biologist, is among the elite of American scientists, with a tenured position at the University of California, Berkeley, and generous funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for his research on fruit flies.
But late last month, dismayed over the Trump administration’s apparent disdain for evidence on climate change and other issues, Dr. Eisen registered the Twitter handle @SenatorPhD and declared his intention to run in the 2018 election for a seat in the United States Senate from California. His campaign slogan: “Liberty, Equality, Reality.”
Jacquelyn Gill, a paleo-ecologist at the University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, has been actively recruited to — eventually — make a bid for a congressional seat by 314 Action, ever since she was quoted in the journal Nature urging her fellow scientists to “do more than write letters.” Staff members at 314 Action (which takes its name from the number pi) liked her attitude, and she happens to live in a swing district.

New Federal Guidelines for School Meals Boost Fruit, Vegetable Consumption
Christine Hsu
Update Date: Mar 04, 2014 05:40 PM EST

Federal guidelines launched in 2012 have significantly increased fruit and vegetable consumption, according to a new study.
Researchers at Harvard School of Public Health looked at school food consumption before and after the new federal standards, which require schools to offer healthier meals, went into effect and found that the guidelines boosted fruit and vegetable consumption.
Researchers said the latest finding goes against criticisms that the new standards will increase food waste.
"There is a push from some organizations and lawmakers to weaken the new standards. We hope the findings, which show that students are consuming more fruits and vegetables, will discourage those efforts," lead author Juliana Cohen, research fellow in the Department of Nutrition at HSPH, said in a news release.
The latest study analyzed plate waste data among 1,030 students in an urban, low-income school district both before and after the new standards. They found that fruit selection increased by 23 percent, entrée and vegetable selection remained unchanged. However, consumption of vegetables increased by 16.2 percent. While fruit consumption was unchanged, researchers noted that more fruit was consumed post-implementation because more students selected fruit overall.
Most importantly, the study revealed that the new standards did not increase food waste. Researchers said the study goes against anecdotal reports from food service directors, teachers, parents, and students that the regulations led to an increase in waste because of larger portion sizes and the requirement that students select a fruit or vegetable.
Nonetheless, researchers noted that high levels of fruit and vegetable waste continued to be a problem. The study revealed that students threw away 60 to 75 percent of vegetables and 40 percent of fruits on their trays.
Researchers recommend that schools focus on improving food quality and taste to cut waste.
"The new school meal standards are the strongest implemented by the USDA to date, and the improved dietary intakes will likely have important health implications for children," researchers concluded.
The findings are published in the journal American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Obama Armada of 45 Naval Destroyers Escort For India Trip
MUMBAI - India - The Pentagon recently announced that 45 U.S. naval destroyers and over 350 jet fighters and bombers are to escort President Obama when he visits the country next week.

The presidential escort waits off the Indian coast
“The ten day India trip is going to cost the U.S. taxpayer nearly two trillion dollars. To be more precise, we’re talking in the region of $200 million per day and we’re not even including the secret service bill right there,” Amy Thompson, senior budget director at the Pentagon told the Herald Sun.
Obama’s trip to Mumbai will last all of ten days and is set to become the most expensive visit a head of state has ever achieved in the whole of history.
“Forget about any trip by Queen Victoria, the Sultan of Brunei or any Saudi King. First off, they don’t have 45 battleships following them around. We know it is totally unnecessary, but we’re Americans, we’re democrats and also we get one term to do this shit, so we’re going to have our fun before the whole shit house goes up in flames,” Jonah Fetherline, Obama’s press secretary told the Herald Tribune.
According to reports within the sprawling city of Mumbai, all beggars and untouchables will be taken off the streets for the trip and put into a container ship off the coast. The roads will have to be cleared of cows and other assorted livestock for the 240 vehicle presidential entourage and a steel perimeter has been built up containing the city for three whole days. Surveillance aircraft will be watching the city, street by street, inch by inch, and even the coconuts from the trees will be removed in case they are used as weapons against the ailing lame-duck president.

Why historic Mormon books are popular among collectors

A copy of the Book of Mormon that sold for $57,500.
Within the larger world of book collecting, the market for Mormon books has become a very active field in the past 20 years.
The 1830 first edition of the Book of Mormon has always been the cornerstone. Its appeal as the first printing of the scripture of a major world religious denomination, released just days before the official establishment of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is obvious.
While first editions of the Bible or Koran are beyond the reach of collectors, the Book of Mormon can be found at auction perhaps once or twice a year, with other copies showing up regularly in the retail market.
Published from Joseph Smith’s manuscript by a country printer in Palmyra, New York, the Book of Mormon is unusual among the world’s most collectible first editions, as almost every copy is unique.
At least 41 printing variations have been spotted on various pages of the first-edition volumes, and the uncorrected and corrected sheets were bound together in so many combinations that there may be no two copies with completely identical text.
However, they were all issued with the same distinctive brown calf binding, with seven double bands of gilt across the backstrip and a leather tag reading “Book of Mormon.” These bindings were not particularly durable. A copy in a well-preserved original binding gets a substantial premium.
The other big factor is provenance, with high prices going to copies signed by important early members of the church or owned by famous collectors.
Charles L. Woodward was one of the first major collectors of Mormon books, though he was not LDS and not particularly sympathetic. He sold his collection in an 1880 auction at Bangs & Company in New York, with a catalogue titled "Bibliothica-Scallawagiana: Catalogue of a Matchless Collection of Books ... Relating to Mormonism." The sale included a first-edition Book of Mormon for what now seems like a scandalously low price of $10.
The market grew steadily over the next century as the church increased in size and stature. In the famous Herbert Auerbach sale of 1947, a fine copy of the first edition caused a stir when it brought $170. But the record auction price for a first-edition Book of Mormon as of 1990 was still only $4,180.
From 1996 to 2007, the price exploded, with new records being set almost every year: $19,550, $32,200, $41,800, $48,300, $56,400 and $82,250. In 2007, a presentation copy from Hyrum Smith signed by Orson Pratt brought $180,000 at Swann Auction Galleries, still a record by a wide margin.
The auction price for a typical copy seems to have stabilized at about $60,000, though that can always be surpassed for a special copy with important provenance.
Numerous book dealers specialize in Mormon books, many of them in the Salt Lake City area. Ken Sanders is probably the most well-known, thanks to his frequent appearances on "Antiques Roadshow." Utah has never had its own book auction house, though.
Most of the copies sold at auction have gone through New York auction houses with large book departments such as Swann, Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Bonhams. The last four copies to come to auction have all been through Swann, each selling for between $50,000 and $62,500 after spirited telephone bidding from across the county. The most recent copy sold on Sept. 17 for $57,500.
Also offered were more than 20 Mormon lots from Milton R. Slater, who quietly collected a superb collection of Mormon books and manuscripts over several decades, including a 1846 Nauvoo printing of the Doctrine and Covenants (sold for $27,500), a copy of Fanny Stenhouse’s "An Englishwoman in Utah" inscribed by Arthur Conan Doyle (sold for $5,250) and two rare pamphlets which Slater acquired at the famous Thomas W. Streeter sale back in 1968 — Aitken's "Journey up the Mississippi from its Mouth to Nauvoo" (sold for $5,500) and Greene's "Facts Relative to the Expulsion of the Mormons" (sold for $12,500).
We don’t know what will come through the doors next, but we are sure that Mormon books will remain a vigorous collecting area for many years to come.

Russia's Rosatom submits bid for nuclear project in SA: report
Wednesday 25 January 2017 - 8:23am
Logo of Rosatom Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, seen at the Innovations Forum 2014 at Technopolis Moscow exhibition center, Moscow, Russia, 14 October 2014.
MOSCOW - Russian state nuclear agency Rosatom has submitted a bid for a nuclear power project in South Africa, TASS news agency cited the company's General Director Alexei Likhachev as saying on Tuesday.
Rosatom had been considered the leading candidate for a tender to build 9.6 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity in South Africa by 2030, but the country’s nuclear state agency, the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) said last year it was no longer "the frontrunner".
On Tuesday Eskom rejected reports that Rosatom had submitted a bid to build a nuclear power project in South Africa, citing that it had not received a bid from anyone because an invitation for bidding process has not yet been opened.

Kodi CLAMPDOWN: New piracy laws could change the face of illegal streaming FOREVER
KODI users are being put on alert about proposed new laws that could change the face of illegal streaming forever.

Kodi users are being warned proposed copyright laws could change illegal streaming forever (Image: KODI • GETTY)
Kodi add-ons that are widely used to illegally stream movies and TV shows could become a thing of the past thanks to proposed copyright laws.
Kodi continues to surge in popularity, with research suggesting the software is being used in more than five million UK homes.
Kodi software is not illegal, but unaffiliated developers can produce third-party add-ons that provide free access to pirated and illegal content.
These apps allow users to stream premium content, like paid-for live sports, the latest Hollywood movies and must-see TV shows for free.
The illegal Kodi add-ons are being targeted by ISPs, government agencies, broadcasters and rights holders.
And proposed copyright laws currently being looked at in Brussels could change how illegal streaming works forever.
In September 2016 the European Commission (EC), the legislative arm of the European Union, published proposals on how to modernise copyright law.
And if the mooted Copyright Directive is enforced, then one specific measure will have a big impact on illegal streaming.
Article 13 of the suggested law puts the onus on online services to ensure content their users upload does not breach copyright.
Kodi: Ever streamed with Kodi? Here’s what is legal, and what is not
Sun, January 21, 2018
With more than one million so-called Kodi Boxes currently in use in the UK, streaming with illicit set-top boxes is becoming hugely-popular. However, a number of changes in the law could bring harsh punishments to those streaming things they shouldn’t.

Kodi: What Is Legal, And What Is Not
{% } %}
Online services will be liable for content that breaches copyright unless “effective and proportionate” measures are enforced, TorrentFreak reported.
In a document online the European Parliament said these measures include the use of “effective content recognition technologies”.
So, in essence - video sharing platforms need to ensure what gets uploaded to their sites is not in breach of copyright.
And if it does, it opens the door for rights holders to demand compensation.
An EC press release from September 2016 announcing the suggested law said: “The Copyright Directive aims to reinforce the position of right holders to negotiate and be remunerated for the online exploitation of their content on video-sharing platforms such as YouTube or Dailymotion.
“Such platforms will have an obligation to deploy effective means such as technology to automatically detect songs or audiovisual works which right holders have identified and agreed with the platforms either to authorise or remove.”
Kodi is perfectly legal but unaffiliated, third-party developers can develop illegal add-ons (Image: KODI)
Illegal Kodi add-ons made by third party developers find and pull together pirated streams of movies and TV shows posted on the internet.
These pirated films that are ready for streaming would have been uploaded to some form of file or video sharing website.
The proposed European copyright law would hugely impact such sites, forcing them to check for any content that is pirated.
And with penalties for hosting pirated movies and TV shows so high, it may force sites that currently are home to such content to crack down on it.
If that’s the case, it would have a huge impact on the availability of illegal streams third-party Kodi add-ons can access.
In the next few weeks lawmakers in Brussels will be looking at these proposed copyright laws and voting on it.
Last month the European Council finalised the latest version of the Copyright Directive.
It’s now going to Brussels’s Legal Affairs Committee of the Parliament (JURI) who will decide how to move ahead.

Julia Reda, an MEP for the Pirate Party, underlined the huge impact such proposals could have.
Speaking to TorrentFreak, she said: “The proposal would require platforms to filter all uploads by their users for potential copyright infringements – not just YouTube and Facebook, but also services like WordPress, TripAdvisor, or even Tinder.
“We know from experience that these algorithmic filters regularly make mistakes and lead to the mass deletion of legal uploads.
“Especially small independent creators frequently see their content taken down because others wrongfully claim copyright on their works.
“There are no safeguards in the proposal against such cases of copyfraud.”

And speaking to Express.co.uk, a European Commission spokesperson said: “The basis of our copyright proposals is that people should be able to make a living from their creative ideas.
“Our proposals also take into account technological developments that help, first, authors to be informed and to prevent their works from being used online without their consent by major online platforms, and second, to ensure fair remuneration of their works.”
The European Digital Rights (EDRi) advocacy group said Brussels lawmakers will vote on the suggested copyright law on June 20 and June 21.
They are calling on those opposed to the proposals to visit saveyourinternet.eu to find out how to ask your MEP to stop the mooted law.

The players will train at the stadium on Saturday ahead of their opener against Manchester City on Sunday – a departure from the traditional methods employed by his predecessor Arsene Wenger.
Pre-season training has included intense double sessions and players can brace themselves for the hairdryer if they fail to reach the high standards the former Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla boss has set for them.
“It’s a new way, a new process.” said Emery.
“The past is very important for this club with the people who were working here.

Will new tactics by terrorist organizations bring an influx of attacks in 2016?
The Islamic State’s (IS) so-called caliphate is being shrunk by the Russians and Syrians in northwestern Syria. On January 26, the Syrian army captured the key location of Sheikh Maskin, which lies on a key crossroads with Damascus to the north and the government-controlled city of Sweida to the east. In the east of IS territory, Peshmerga forces from the autonomous area of Iraqi Kurdistan not only hold their own, but also push the Islamic State back. In the southwest, the fall of Ramadi to the Iraqi army and Iranian-backed militia in December 2015 was a severe blow to the terrorist organization.
Together, all parties involved have contributed to IS losing large portions of its previously held territory at the beginning of 2016.
The latter part of 2015 saw the Russian and US-led coalition airstrikes target oil locations, vehicles carrying oil and the Islamic State’s main bank, costing the group millions of dollars. So much so that there were reports that its fighters were taking pay cuts as money became scarcer.
In Syria and Iraq, the various forces fighting the terrorist organization will have to ensure that the successes in 2015 will be built on in 2016. What will still be in place is a huge propaganda machine capable of turning quiet, innocent people into murderers on its behalf. Like any group, IS will at some point have to fight back as it finds itself losing ground, having its back against a wall. It will lack the funds, fighters and equipment to retaliate.
With individuals and groups outside of Syria and Iraq claiming allegiance to IS, some have allegedly secured recent successes for the organization by taking terrorism to the streets. It will not be difficult for IS to organize and create chaos in summer tourism spots or around Europe.
People have already seen the consequences of the horrific Tunisian attack on its tourism industry, populated shopping malls being targeted in Kenya and Somalia, and innocent people enjoying a night out in Paris. The Islamic State will strike at any soft target that is available.
In January, French police admitted that they had thwarted another Paris strike. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve pointed out that since spring 2015, French intelligence services had foiled 11 terrorist attacks that had been planned by IS—those of which were prior to the November 2015 Paris attack. Since that incident, French authorities have placed the country in a “state of emergency” and have declared that it will remain in place until the Islamic State is defeated.
So far in 2016
The year 2016 started well for international terrorists when the Pakistani Taliban attacked Bacha Khan University in northwest Pakistan on January 20, killing 30 people and injuring dozens more.

A day later, al-Shabab attacked a beachside restaurant-hotel in Somalia’s capital of Mogadishu, resulting in approximately 20 people losing their lives. Al-Shabab had pledged its allegiance to IS in October 2015, having once been allied with al-Qaeda. The interesting point regarding this assault was that it was a two-pronged offensive: Suicide bombers struck the front of the restaurant, while a sea-borne assault raided those on the beach.
This style would allow for very few people to escape. There were even reports of white people being checked to see if they were dead. This was probably in response to the French government and others issuing a guide as to what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.
Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the incursion and claimed that its militants wore suicide vests. Suicide vests are one of the latest and new additions to a terrorist’s method of attack. The first time the vests were used was during the Paris attack in November 2015.
STRATEGIC TARGETS AND TACTICS
Terrorists are learning from each coordinated attack and, with it, the capability to strike, organize and cause death and chaos with slightly different tactics. Like any military-style operation, there will be people who look at the procedure and see where they can improve. It is interesting to note that after the 2008 Mumbai attack, al-Shabab raided a shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in what appeared to be a similar operation.
In January 2016, Europol published a press release regarding IS changing its modus operandi. The paper gave no indication over the change in tactics, but did say that IS has a special forces-style group that would be used in future terrorist attacks it conducts, outside of IS territory.
If the Islamic State attempts to “set Europe alight” with acts of terrorism, what would the targets be?
In recent years, terrorist organizations have started favoring the Mumbai-style assaults, where small groups of gunmen attack a soft location and kill as many people as they possibly can. This type of attack gives the terrorist group huge media and press coverage. With that, the world watches as the event unfolds, while various newsgroups search for exclusive shots or information.
Terrorists will also be following the live events and watching for ways to improve, as well as taking note as to how authorities respond. News staff attempting to analyze and preempt what is happening, what has happened and what the authorities are doing gives the terrorists some food for thought for their next attack.
Tourism and Refugees
Tourism may be a key target for 2016, especially around popular coastal holiday resorts since the successful Tunisia attack in June 2015 at Port El Kantaoui by Seifeddine Rezgui, an affiliate of IS. Thirty of the 38 victims were from the United Kingdom—the others from the Republic of Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Russia, Portugal, Tunisia and Ukraine.
Within Europe, there are numerous targets to choose from. As the so-called IS caliphate is threatened in Syria and Iraq, the more it will want to strike outside its borders.
The Tunisian attack, although carried out by a lone gunman, may have been a rehearsal for later attacks. The death toll from one man and the impact on the country’s tourism industry were huge. Tunisia is currently undergoing some civil unrest between last year’s attack and the announcement of several UK tour guides that they were not selling deals there.
Since the Tunisian attack on the holiday resort, tourists are now feeling unsafe in North Africa and will seek different locations to go on vacation. Southern Europe has many tourist spots that people will now look to for their summer holidays, especially after a British government-issued statement outlining the risks of vacationing in Tunisia.
With many refugees from Syria and Iraq now in Europe, it is possible that some of these may be members of IS. If that is the case, the ability to set Europe alight will work in the group’s favor. The more ground that IS loses, the more desperate it will become, sending signals out to sleeper cells to ignite the fuse.
Directing forces toward specific targets will have to be strategically considered: the hard target versus the soft target, the sophisticated target versus the unsophisticated target. Any attack on a sophisticated target will be well-planned against government buildings or personnel, organized with the correct logistics. If IS militants attempt to take a government-controlled building, this would act as a huge propaganda coup. Softer targets would include shopping malls and tourist areas.
Targeting a School
A turn of events could occur if IS attacks a Western school. Over recent years, terrorists have attacked schools and schoolchildren around the world: Pakistan in December 2014 at the Peshawar Army Public School by the Taliban; the Beslen School siege in September 2004 by Chechens in Russia; the lone wolf attack in Norway by Anders Behring Breivik in July 2011; and the recent attack on Bacha Khan University in northwest Pakistan on January 20, 2016. No target is beneath them.
In January 2016, a number of schools in the UK and France received bomb threats. While an online pro-Vladimir Putin group claimed responsibility, the number schools affected would have stretched British and French authorities in dealing with the hoaxes. The act would not have gone unnoticed by terrorists, who may look at using this as a method of attack in the future. On January 31, the Islamic State announced that it would attack the UK with an act so horrific it would turn “children’s hair white.” Is this an indication that IS would attack a school?
The ability for terrorists to strike is for them to decide. Within Europe, there are numerous targets to choose from. As the so-called IS caliphate is threatened in Syria and Iraq, the more it will want to strike outside its borders. Statements by the group claiming that it was going to kidnap Russians vacationing in Turkey and take them over the border to be beheaded cannot be taken lightly.
French intelligence experts recently claimed that the November attack in Paris was a dress rehearsal and there is worse to come. There is a high possibility that 2016 could become very bloody. With IS losing ground, it will want to take reprisals. Europe and North Africa may well carry the brunt of its retribution.

Review: ‘Winter’s Tale’ Starring Colin Farrell, Russell Crowe & Jennifer Connelly

Akiva Goldsman is one of those Hollywood screenwriters who has accrued a fair amount of animosity over the years, both because of his perceived lack of talent (he did have a hand in scripting “Batman & Robin,” “The Da Vinci Code,” and “Lost in Space,” amongst others) and for his almost unparalleled level of success (he won a Best Screenplay Oscar for his work on Ron Howard‘s “A Beautiful Mind,” and in the process taught us all that mental illness could be cured through the healing power of love). Regardless of what you think of him, Goldsman has genuine power, and for the past few years has used that power to secure funding for a lavish adaptation of novelist Mark Helprin‘s goopy 1983 supernatural romance “Winter’s Tale.” It is the ultimate Akiva Goldsman statement, mixing both his propensity for high concept gobbledygook with cloying, saccharine sentimentality. The result is a colossal folly the likes of which we haven’t seen in years. It’s truly unbelievable. We’re still reeling.
While the trailers and television spots for “Winter’s Tale” are selling it as a sweeping, time-traveling romance, the opening sequences make it very clear that the movie is more like what would happen if Nicholas Sparks wrote “Cloud Atlas“—there are a number of timelines, some supernatural elements, and a whole lot of breathy narration about miracles and chance and fate. But unlike “Cloud Atlas,” which was nothing if not ambitious and heady, “Winter’s Tale” is lazy and repetitive and doesn’t have a whole lot on its mind, coming across instead like an empty-headed, lovesick doodle. This is the kind of movie where the Warner Bros. logo is revealed, before turning a sepia tone the color of iced tea, while sickly sweet music overtakes the soundtrack.
At the turn of the century, a pair of immigrants (one of them is played by Matt Bomer in silly old-timey garb) try to gain access to America, only to be turned away once they’ve arrived because they aren’t healthy enough. They’re instructed, by a horribly rendered lens flare (seriously—the movie is riddled with them) to set their baby inside a model ship and then send that baby towards America. You can tell Goldsman is attempting to create and sustain an atmosphere of magical realism, but it instead comes across as strained, half-assed whimsy. While all of this is happening, the story is also jumping forward to present day, where a bedraggled man named Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) is searching Grand Central Station for clues to his past, sort of like a middle-aged Hugo.
Soon enough, the story starts in earnest (and we do mean earnest), with Peter Lake, in 1916 Manhattan, running away from a violent crime boss named (get this) Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe). It looks like Peter’s proverbial goose is cooked, until a magical white horse named Athansor (!) shows up and whisks Peter away, by literally flying over the amassed group of gangsters and thugs. Jesus. Just recounting the plot is painful. Imagine having to watch it. Peter decides that the horse is his new partner in crime and begins plans to leave the city. That is, of course, until, once again egged on by the horse and another phony flash of a computer-generated lens flare, has him breaking and entering the house of a gorgeous, consumptive young woman named Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay). It’s love at first sight, she curbs his bad boy behavior, blah blah blah…
The details of “Winter’s Tale’s” plot, which might borrow its name from the Shakespeare classic but has nothing to do with it, are so asinine and unimportant that they don’t really need to be recounted here. (In our notes that we took during the movie, the words “TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE” are double-underlined.) You should probably know that Will Smith shows up at some point as The Judge, giving us the alternate universe thrill of seeing what would have happened if Jay-Z had played the Robert De Niro part in “Angel Heart.” Smith, whose apartment in 1916 is decked out in a modern chaise lounge, reads from “A Brief History of Time” (yuk) and wears a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt and hooped earrings in both of his lobes. It’s at this point that “Winter’s Tale” goes from being pointless and stupid and awful to being straight-up insufferable, that rare monstrosity that is so sure of its own importance and cleverness that it can’t even allow itself to be funny.
Peter Lake’s love, of course, succumbs, and Crowe’s minions catch up with him and drop him off a bridge (don’t worry, the magical flying horse gets away unharmed). Lake crawls out of the water, though, which is when “Winter’s Tale” doesn’t even bother explaining itself, because we’re suddenly in modern day New York City, without any clue whether or not Lake has woken up from some kind of supernatural stupor really, really late, or if he’s been living in New York for a hundred years in a kind of amnesiac fugue state. (How does such a person, say, pay Manhattan rent? Especially when all he does is draw elaborate chalk drawings of his doomed lover?) The Demonic Russell Crowe is still around, of course, and still supremely pissed off (why? Let it simmer Demonic Russell Crowe!) Meanwhile, Farrell has fallen into some kind of relationship with a plucky, incredibly beautiful reporter (Jennifer Connelly), whose daughter is similarly afflicted, this time with a more modern medical ailment. Cue talk about miracles, and ascending to the stars, and people turning into piles of crushed snow when you kill them. Also: another appearance by Will Smith as hip-hop Satan! Yes!
“Winter’s Tale” is unbelievable, in that you seriously cannot believe how fucking stupid it is. It seems to top itself, scene after scene, piling on general ludicrousness, dopey philosophical underpinnings, supernatural hooey (complete with nonsensical “mythology” and “rules”), with all the sophistication of a bedtime story and the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face (yes, those are our bloody teeth, thanks). It doesn’t even make any sense in the bubble-world of its own invention, like when Eva Marie Saint shows up as the elderly version of a young girl that Peter knew back in olden times. He has supposedly been gone (or underground or whatever) for more than 100 years. So she is supposed to be, what, 115 by now? Goldsman, whose direction is as poor as his writing, seems to suggest that none of this really matters, because of something about the transformative power of love and flying horses (who are really dogs?) and the eternal struggle between good and evil.
This is a movie that is many things—a profound work of hubris, a misguided attempt at filmmaking, incredibly boring—and yet it is nothing. Instead of being overwhelmed by the woozy feeling that the best big screen romances give you, “Winter’s Tale” just leaves you befuddling and probably more than a little bit angry. A lot of good actors (including Farrell, who has been so great in things as disparate as the splatter comedy “Seven Psychopaths” and the deeply-underrated horror remake “Fright Night“) are wasted, many of them former Goldsman collaborators who are only here because the filmmaker called in a favor, and the entire movie feels belabored, lumbering from one awful, over-dressed set piece to another. It’s wrongheaded, it’s horrendous, it’s filled with lines of dialogue that are utter howlers, and yet, it’s the type of movie that feels so confident that it really is something. It is, in fact, not. This Valentine’s Day, if you really love someone, keep them far away from “Winter’s Tale.” [F]

Canaletto, Nolde and O’Connor in National Gallery of Ireland’s new line-up
Gallery on track to record one million visitors following successful Vermeer exhibition

The refurbished National Gallery has surpassed attendance targets since it reopened earlier this year, its director, Sean Rainbird, said at the launch of the gallery’s programme of exhibitions between now and spring 2019.
The Dargan and Milltown wings of the gallery were officially reopened in June following a six-year-long multimillion-euro refurbishment project. “Inevitably if you’ve got more space back you do more things,” said Mr Rainbird. “We’re adapting to an organisation which has grown by 40 or 50 per cent. We’ve grown as an institution. There’s been a firing up of the energies.”
While the gallery was projected to have around 825,000 visitors this year following the official reopening, the actual number looks set to be comfortably over a million by the end of December. “We planned quite cautiously because it’s important not to overshoot,” said Mr Rainbird. “But on the other hand we didn’t know how much we should charge for an exhibition. These were the nitty-gritty questions we have had to answer through the year.”
More than 100,000 tickets were sold for Vermeer and the Masters of Genre Painting, which ran for three months this summer.
“We ensured deliberately that we didn’t stuff it full of people,” said Mr Rainbird. “We’ve all been to these dreadful blockbusters where you can only see over the heads of six people. It’s very stuffy and not a nice experience at all. You could say we’ve foregone a little bit of income by doing so, but the most important thing is to allow people to admire the work.”
The gallery’s next exhibition, opening on October 25th, showcases the art of Frederic William Burton, the Clare-born painter who was director for 20 years of the National Gallery in London. Burton’s 1864 work, The Meeting on the Turret Stairs was voted Ireland’s favourite painting by the public in 2012.
Next year’s programme includes exhibitions of works by German Expressionist Emil Nolde and Irish post-Impressionist Roderic O’Connor along with rediscovered drawings of Brazilian wildlife by 17th century Dutch master Frans Post.
Next summer, Circus 250 will commemorate the 250th anniversary of the first circus through works of art and archive material focusing on the circus and performing arts. To coincide with the centenary of the formation of the first Dáil, an exhibition will explore aspects of Countess Markiewicz’s complex identity through visual portrayals of her in painting, photography, illustration and film.
Canaletto and the Art of Venice, running from December 2018 to March 2019, will present a selection of some of the finest 18th century Venetian works from the UK’s Royal Collection. “They’re really quite rare,” said Mr Rainbird. “It’s not only the 60 paintings; it’s the hundreds of works on paper and also the work of his colleagues and contemporaries.
The Canaletto, Burton, O’Connor and Emil Nolde exhibitions will carry an admission charge, while all other exhibitions will be free.
Mr Rainbird expressed his hope that the Government would provide funding for the next phase of its refurbishment, which knits together the Millennium wing on South Leinster Street with the Dargan and Milltown wings on Merrion Square, and addresses serious inadequacies in the current library and conservation spaces. “We really have to create a long-term solution,” he said. “I think we’ll know within the next few weeks or months which way this is going,”

84% of delegates vote in favour of new programme
Mon, Oct 12, 2009, 01:00
Harry McGee
THE GREEN Party decisively endorsed the Programme for Government and also rejected, by a large majority, a motion opposing the setting up of the National Asset Management Agency (Nama).
At the conclusion of its day-long special convention at the RDS on Saturday, the party announced that 84 per cent of over 600 delegates had backed the programme, agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Greens late on Friday night.
Party rules require the backing of two-thirds of the members to endorse motions of this magnitude.
The attendance at the meeting was higher than that of the special convention in 2007 that backed the party entering government and the percentage backing the leadership on Saturday was only three points lower than the 87 per cent achieved then.
The strong backing for Nama was viewed as a vote of approval of the party’s continuance in Government, and of the plan to rescue Irish financial institutions.
The manner in which the party’s national executive council phrased the motion meant that members who opposed Nama were required to garner the support of two-thirds to strike the bank rescue legislation down. In the event, the motion was rejected by 69 per cent to 31 per cent, a much larger defeat than had been envisaged.
Of the 622 valid votes in the vote on the Programme for Government document, some 523 were in favour with 99 against. In the second vote, some 415 delegates voted against the motion (and, therefore, in favour of Nama) with 189 supporting the motion.
Party leader John Gormley, speaking immediately after the vote, described the outcome as an overwhelming endorsement for the party and for the Programme for Government.
“We have to live up to those very high expectations. There will be no resiling from this Programme for Government. It will be implemented,” he told party members.
He said the new programme was about recovery, about getting the country on its feet again. “We have no illusions,” he added.
Minister for Energy Eamon Ryan said that the vote had strengthened the Greens as a party and made it easier for it to work in the Government at a very hard time. “Why such a new programme? It was exceptional because we are in exceptional times. We need to stop and check to see what we have to do,” Mr Ryan said.
Mr Ryan and Mr Gormley rejected the contention that many of the commitments in the 2007 programme had not been achieved and that many of the new measures were not time-specific.
Mr Gormley instanced the 2007 commitment to have a directly elected mayor of Dublin. He said that this would happen in 2010, a year ahead of schedule.
Mr Gormley also maintained that the internal debate within the party on Nama would have the effect of making the legislation stronger because it had succeeded in adding amendments to the legislation.
The meeting on Saturday got under way at 11.30am, a little over 12 hours after Taoiseach Brian Cowen and Mr Gormley had signed off on the draft document.
During the debate on the programme, only two out of 30 or so speakers chosen at random spoke against the programme. The debate on Nama, later in the afternoon, caused more division among members.
Speaking at a press conference after the vote, Mr Ryan stood over the party’s record in government. “We have been in Government for two and a half years. We have learned to work in Government. It’s not easy.
“We are tying to change the way that politics works and change the economy. We have very hard decisions in the upcoming months.”
Mr Gormley and Mr Ryan said they were fully aware of the decisions that lay ahead.
“We cannot argue against the mathematics. We are borrowing €400 million a week,” said Mr Gormley.

Story Highlights
For years, folks in Milwaukee have blamed one another for the region’s racial disparity and the growing gap between rich and poor. Yet, a generation ago, Milwaukee offered hope, opportunity and jobs to people of all races. What changed?
CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE
Editor's note: This series was originally published Dec. 5-7, 2004.
No major urban center in America has suffered as much as Milwaukee’s from the economic upheaval of a globalizing economy, an exhaustive analysis by the Journal Sentinel has found. No other African-American community worked as intensively at manufacturing products that are no longer made here, or was less prepared for a historic shift from unskilled labor.
In little more than a generation, Milwaukee has morphed from an El Dorado of unrivaled opportunity for African-Americans — and a beacon for their middle-class aspirations — to a locus of downward mobility without equal among other big U.S. cities.
The result: A depression in the region’s urban core far more severe than the Great Depression of the 1930s.

7-year-old immigrant girl dies after Border Patrol arrest
Posted: 9:01 PM, Dec 13, 2018
Updated: 2018-12-14 04:01:14Z
By: Associated Press
LAS CRUCES, N.M. — A 7-year-old girl who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border with her father last week died after being taken into the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol, federal immigration authorities confirmed Thursday.
The Washington Post reports the girl died of dehydration and shock more than eight hours after she was arrested by agents near Lordsburg, New Mexico. The girl was from Guatemala and was traveling with a group of 163 people who approached agents to turn themselves in on Dec. 6.
It's unknown what happened to the girl during the eight hours before she started having seizures and was flown to an El Paso hospital.
In a statement, Customs and Border Protection said the girl had not eaten or consumed water in several days.
The agency did not provide The Associated Press with the statement it gave to the Post, despite repeated requests.
Processing 163 immigrants in one night could have posed challenges for the agency, whose detention facilities are meant to be temporary and don't usually fit that many people.
When a Border Patrol agent arrests someone, that person gets processed at a facility but usually spends no more than 72 hours in custody before they are either transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or, if they're Mexican, quickly deported home.
The girl's death raises questions about whether border agents knew she was ill and whether she was fed anything or given anything to drink during the eight-plus hours she was in custody.
Immigrants, attorneys and activists have long raised issues with the conditions of Border Patrol holding cells. In Tucson, an ongoing lawsuit claims holding cells are filthy, extremely cold and lacking basic necessities such as blankets. A judge overseeing that lawsuit has ordered the agency's Tucson Sector, which patrols much of the Arizona-Mexico border, to provide blankets and mats to sleep on and to continually turn over surveillance footage from inside the cells.
The Border Patrol has seen an increasing trend of large groups of immigrants, many with young children, walking up to agents and turning themselves in. Most are Central American and say they are fleeing violence. They turn themselves in instead of trying to circumvent authorities, many with plans to apply for asylum.
Agents in Arizona see groups of over 100 people on a regular basis, sometimes including infants and toddlers.
Arresting such groups poses logistical problems for agents who have to wait on transport vans that are equipped with baby seats to take them to processing facilities, some which are at least half hour north of the border.
The death of the 7-year-old comes after a toddler died in May just after being released from an ICE family detention facility in Texas, and as the administration of Donald Trump attempts to ban people from asking for asylum if they crossed the border illegally. A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked that ban, but the administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate it Tuesday.
Cynthia Pompa, advocacy manager for the ACLU Border Rights Center, said migrant deaths increased last year even as the number of border crossing dropped.
"This tragedy represents the worst possible outcome when people, including children, are held in inhumane conditions. Lack of accountability, and a culture of cruelty within CBP have exacerbated policies that lead to migrant deaths," Pompa said.

State Sen. Flanagan Draws Heat for Supporting Trump’s Education Secretary Pick

Despite a chorus of critics questioning her commitment to public schools, New York’s most powerful elected Republican, State Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, has added his name to a letter supporting Betsy DeVos, President Donald Trump’s controversial nominee for education secretary.
Flanagan (R-Smithtown), who once chaired the state senate education committee, joined elected Republican officials from 50 states in a letter sent to U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate education committee, who was holding her confirmation hearing.
DeVos, a Michigan billionaire, has drawn criticism for supporting charter schools in Detroit that take public education dollars without accompanying public oversight.
State Sen. George Latimer (D-Westchester), the ranking minority member of the Senate Education Committee, reportedly slammed Flanagan for his action.
“Majority Leader Flanagan should stand up for New York students, not Trump Administration officials dedicated to stripping our state of needed resources,” Latimer told the New York Daily News.
The letter Flanagan signed doesn’t see DeVos that way. His spokesman declined to comment on her nomination despite repeated requests.
“Betsy DeVos will put children first and empower not only states to lead the way in making critical education decisions,” the letter reads, “but also empower parents to choose what type of education is best for their children.”
Alexander’s senate education committee is expected to vote Tuesday on DeVos’ nomination. Then the full Senate will decide whether to confirm her to the cabinet post.
An advocate of school vouchers as well as charters, DeVos is facing a groundswell of opposition from major education groups, including the New York State United Teachers, the United Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, as well as local groups on Long Island such as the Badass Teachers Association, New York State Allies for Public Education and Action Together Long Island.
During her confirmation hearing on Jan. 17, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) asked DeVos if her nomination was tied to her family’s donation of an estimated $200 million to Republican political candidates. She said it wasn’t. He joined Democrats in the Senate who called for a second hearing to look into DeVos’s recently submitted financial disclosures and ethical concerns. The request was denied by Chairman Alexander.
During her often tense Senate hearing, critics said DeVos demonstrated a lack of knowledge about federal laws governing special education students, showed ignorance of the difference between measuring students’ proficiency and growth, and presented a convoluted argument in support of arming teachers in case of attacks by “grizzly bears.” Critics pointed out that she never sent her children to public school. They also cited her lack of teaching experience, as well as her work with pro-charter school advocacy groups Children First America, the American Education Reform Council and the American Federation for Children.
At the hearing, DeVos was asked if she would oppose privatizing public schools and commit to funding public education.
“I look forward, if confirmed, to working with you to talk about how we address the needs of all parents and all students,” DeVos said in reply.
“We acknowledge today that not all schools are working for the students that are assigned to them,” she added. “I’m hopeful that we can work together to find common ground and ways that we can solve those issues and empower parents to make choices on behalf of their children that are right for them.”
Michael Hynes, superintendent of Patchogue-Medford Schools, said Flanagan’s support of DeVos is “reprehensible.”
“It shows his true colors, and clearly he does not care about public education,” said Hynes, who has been a leading critic of the reliance on standardized state test scores to measure student performance.
Jeanette Deutermann, a Common Core critic, leader of the Opt-Out movement on Long Island and member of the steering committee for the New York State Allies for Public Education, denounced Flanagan’s endorsement of DeVos.
“Anyone who watched those confirmation hearings or dipped even an inch into her background yet still supports her nomination is doing so under a delusional ego-driven political pretense and cares nothing for his young constituents in our Long Island public schools or their parents,” Deutermann told the Press.
Marla Kilfoyle, social studies teacher at Oceanside High School and manager of teacher advocacy group Badass Teachers Association, said that Flanagan’s support for DeVos proved his lack of concern not only for the students of New York, but for the entire nation.
“John Flanagan has shown time and time again that he will put his own needs and wants before the families and children of New York State,” Kilfoyle told the Press. “To endorse a dangerously unqualified candidate like Betsy DeVos, who had no clue that [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act] was a federal law that states had to follow, who had no clue what the difference was between proficiency and growth, and who said that guns were okay in schools so we could shoot grizzly bears, only proves she is absolutely unqualified.”
DeVos had pushed for passage of Michigan’s first charter-school bill in 1993, which allowed public money to be used for semi-independent schools that operated outside of the regulations that govern more traditional public schools. Public and private funds poured into the charter initiatives, but there was virtually no transparency on how that money was spent. A Detroit Free Press investigation reported that students’ standardized-test scores at charter schools were no better than traditional public school scores.
The report also found that lower-income students were “effectively segregated into poorer-performing schools, while the parents of more privileged students were better equipped to navigate the system.”
Tom Watkins, Michigan’s former education superintendent and a charter school supporter, told the Detroit Free Press that “in a number of cases, people are making a boatload of money, and the kids aren’t getting educated.”
DeVos nomination is expected to be approved along party lines.

A School of Social Revolution
Bela Kun
A School of Social Revolution
First Published: Pravda May 15, 1918
Source: International Socialist Library No. 15, Revolutionary Essays by Bela Kun, B.S.P., London.
Transcription/Markup: Brian Reid
Proofreader: Chris Clayton
Public Domain: Marxists Internet Archive (2005). You may freely copy, distribute, display and perform this work; as well as make derivative and commercial works. Please credit “Marxists Internet Archive” as your source.
The counter-revolutionary forces have collected in force. It is quite comprehensible that, amongst the Russian proletarian masses, many should be awaiting the international revolution with impatience. Bolshevism is feeling the full pressure of persecution of the international counter-revolution because Bolshevism is the particular system of ideas which, represents the modern revolutionary movement. For the propertied classes, this system of ideas means deadly danger; for the Labour movement it is an inspiring and, creative force.
After the many buffetings of the war a considerable part of the Western European proletariat ended up in Russia. We may discover from the diplomatic notes of the German and Austrian Governments what these proletarians and workers have experienced and learnt.
We can see that the revolution has had an infectious influence upon these proletarians, from amongst whom large numbers have emigrated to Russia, when we consider certain phenomena, which might almost be called “mass phenomena.”
Naturalisation into citizenship of the Russian proletarian State is a result of the influence of the revolution, although in some cases that naturalisation was prompted not by revolutionary motives, but by a kind of Nazarenism. A mere passively-resisting attitude towards the predatory aims of the imperialists — mere horror — does not represent the awakening of revolutionary consciousness.
But that is not the reason to which we can attribute facts like the events at Neriansk. There, during the course of several days, five hundred Magyar proletarians and workers became naturalised as Russian citizens, and united against the counter-revolutionary bands of Semenov. Amongst these revolutionary volunteers are many who, at home, never took part in the Labour movement; and it is only the Russian revolution that has given them their Socialist education. Those who have participated in the propagandist work of the Social-Democratic parties cannot but agree that the educational significance of the revolution has attained unprecedented proportions.
Revolutions are the locomotives of history; not only in the objective sense, but also in the sense of their rapid development of the minds of the workers, within whom there takes place a process of deliberate re-examination of all previous values.
In this connection the letters received at the editorial and other offices of the foreign groups of the Russian Communist Party are not without interest. We shall quote a few passages from these letters to illustrate the educative influence, of the proletarian revolution. They were received by the newspaper “The Social Revolution,” the organ of the Hungarian Communist group.
Here, for example, is the letter of a working man — of a miner. He is writing to his wife at Budapest, and sending a copy of his letter to the editorial office. In Hungary he belonged neither to the Labour Party nor to a trade union. He is now living at Kolchugina, in Siberia. He writes to his wife, inter alia:
“I received your past-card from Budapest, saying you had sent me 100 kronen. I haven’t received them; but it doesn’t matter, as I am working here and can earn enough to live on. But I am very sorry for you: how can you all manage to live on a quarter of a pound of bread? We, at any rate, are living in free Russia. What grieves me is not that I have to work in the depths of a pit, but that you are suffering. It’s no good them writing in the papers that we’ve still got enough bread — we don't believe it! We know very well that not everyone is starving — Count Tisza and other gentlemen are not going hungry, of course, but the soldiers’ wives and children are. Their fathers, after shedding their blood, have been left to suffer in Siberia, while the children, thanks to the lords and ladies, are starving. Oh yes, the workers can perish; so long as Count Karolyi, Lukacs, Kraus, and others can fill their pockets, it doesn’t matter to them what happens to the wives and children of the men who were torn away from their families at the very beginning of the war to defend their “king and country.” Now everybody’s eyes are being opened, though. The capitalists can trumpet abroad as loudly as they like, that the Hungarian soldier was defending his fatherland: there aren’t many who will believe it. Why don’t they make peace? The Russian soldiers have all come back from the front. But the capitalists’ pockets, I suppose, are not yet full enough, and so they’ve got to fight to the last Hungarian soldier. I know it all, and so do others!“
This is the letter of a “latter-day revolutionist.”
Here is what workers write who at home took a more or less active part in the proletarian movement; two metal-workers from Budapest, at present employed at Linovka Station (Voronezh Province), who happened to receive one number of a newspaper published in Hungarian: “Your respected newspaper, after passing through hundreds of hands, has reached our remote little hamlet, where a few prisoners of war, amongst them Hungarians, are leading a monotonous existence. We read with great interest every line of the paper, and with every word there rose within us undying hatred and desire for vengeance — vengeance for those who have suffered agonies and poured out their blood on the fields of battle. . . . We longed for peace, and looked forward to returning. . . . But where shall we return? . . . You are quite right to say, honoured comrades, ‘from captivity to prison.’ But no, we cannot be blinded by ‘defence of the fatherland.’ . . . True, we weren't blind before, either: we were made to go. . . . ”
The following passage from another letter shows how exactly that process begins, and the minds of working men, which leads to a clear and intelligent adoption of Bolshevik tactics, and how the idea of an armed rising, so foreign to all the western Social-Democratic parties, enters into the soul of the proletariat: “I assure you that I will only return to Hungary if the social revolution breaks out at home. In that case I shall hasten at once with arms in my hands to assist my struggling brothers against the imperialists. In my own country I belonged to the Woodworkers’ Union, and here in Sarapul too.” Here is the letter of a wheelwright and a mason, working at Akhtirka; in Hungary they were active party workers and agitators. They have become real and true Bolsheviks, as their letter shows: “We are very glad that you (Hungarians) have joined the Bolsheviks. Our return home depends on a revolution there. All we ask of our comrades is to write us immediately what form of activity we should engage in while we are staying here.”
These extracts are in no way tendencious. They are snatches from letters taken from a very large correspondence. One may say that an overwhelming majority of the letters breathes forth not only a desire for peace on pacifist grounds, but also a will to, and expectation of, the proletarian revolution.
The mere appearance of this revolutionary will denotes a grave danger, not only for the capitalist class, but also for the opportunist Socialists. The revolution in Hungary will probably assume an anti-German character. German imperialism is the object of universal hatred amongst the Hungarian lower middle class, which, though not so numerous as in Russia, is still large enough to endow the revolution with a general nationalistic character.
But the school of the Russian revolution has created detachments which will be the grave-diggers of that nationalistic character, and may become the grave-diggers of capitalism.	It would be difficult to imagine a school which taught better or more quickly. Those who hitherto had taken part in a Labour movement which was distorted by the lower middle class have now seen civil war at close quarters. Pacifism, which revolted against arms in general, and not against the arms only of the oppressors, has now lost its influence. In Russia the workers have learnt the usefulness of arms for attaining freedom, and the necessity of an armed rising for the purpose of conquering and swiftly shattering the power of the State.
The appearance of the grave-diggers of capitalism and social treachery will play its part; the Bolshevist advance guard is not only going to the help of the oncoming Hungarian revolution, but is itself preparing it for its work.

INEC Calls For Strategies To Increase Women’s Participation In Electoral Process.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has called on stakeholders in the electoral process to come up with strategies that will promote increased participation of women in politics and governance.
National Commissioner in charge of Election Observation and Party Monitoring in INEC, Prof. Antonia T. Okoosi-Simbine made the call on Wednesday at the North Central Zonal Workshop on ‘Enhancing Women’s Participation in the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), the role of Civil Society Organisations’ held at Sheraton Hotels, Abuja.
The Commissioner said it has become imperative for the Commission to work with other stakeholders and come up with strategies to ensure that more women are reached and encouraged to register and collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs).
Prof. Simbine said that the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), mandates INEC to carry out CVR nationwide and pursuant to this requirement, the Commission commenced the CVR on Thursday, April 27, 2017 at the level of INEC Local Government Area offices nationwide.
She disclosed that over four million Nigerians have been registered across the country since the exercise commenced, adding that out of a total of 1,547,405 registered voters in the North Central Zone, 680,812 are females while 866,593 are males.
The National Commissioner observed that the gender distribution of fresh registrants for the first quarter 2018 shows that a total of 1,362,293 women and 1,560,823 men registered during the period. She regretted that women were far behind their male counterparts.
“The registration of voters is an essential preparatory step in any election. It is a pre-requisite for exercising the right to vote and those whose names are not on the Register of Voters and do not have PVCs will not be allowed to vote on Election Day. It is, therefore, important for all women aged 18 and above to register and collect their PVCs so as to vote their preferred candidates,” She added.
Prof. Simbine said that Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and the Media have been collaborating with the Commission to implement election activities adding, “it is in recognition of the enormous contributions of the media and CSOs in deepening the electoral process and expectations of greater collaboration working towards 2019, that INEC organised this meeting to ensure that more women register and pick up their PVCs.”
She explained that the Commission developed the INEC Gender Policy to ensure that its electoral functions and operations are gender sensitive and responsive and the policy is expected to foster gender balance in the Commission and to stimulate stakeholders in the electoral process to do the same.
Prof. Simbine assured that the Commission will continue to engage with critical stakeholders at various levels to ensure support to incorporate gender issues into the electoral process in Nigeria, stating that the responsibility to build a gender balanced democracy for the Nigeria of today and the future lies on the stakeholders.
The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) FCT, Alhaji Yahaya Bello while welcoming participants, noted that the timely workshop will also focus on the role of the CSOs in ensuring increased participation of women in the pre-election activities.

He said that since the CVR commenced in FCT last April, the exercise has been going on in the territory’s six Area Councils, with preferential attention given to pregnant women, nursing mothers and the elderly, adding that the turnout of women has been impressive.
While calling on CSOs to contribute in the area of sensitization to enhance the participation of women in the exercise, the REC also urged them to focus more on explaining the modalities and eligibility criteria for the exercise in their sensitization outreaches, especially at the grassroots.
In a goodwill message, the Project Director of European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES), facilitator of the workshop, Mr. David Le. Notre observed that women participation enriches democracy and makes it more responsive to the aspirations of the people, but regretted that women participation in the political process has been limited.
The Project Director, who was represented by Gender and Inclusive Programme Officer, Cathy Latwa said that current CVR provides women with the opportunity to participate actively in the political process, not only by ensuring that more women are registered but also translating this numerical strength into electing more women into elective positions.
Mr. Notre assured of ECES’ commitment towards equitable participation of women in the political process adding, “we will continue to mainstream gender issues in all our support to INEC in collaboration with the Gender Desk unit of INEC.”
The Deputy Director in charge of Gender Division in INEC, Mrs. Blessing Obidegwu said that the objectives of the workshop was to among others; encourage more women to register and collect their PVCs in readiness for the 2019 General Elections and beyond; sensitize women on their rights and the power of their votes and by registering to vote, more women will participate in the electoral process which is important for democracy to thrive in Nigeria.
Mrs. Obidegwu said that it is important that women are made to understand the power of their PVCs which should be used to vote for their preferred candidates or vote out those they estimate are not delivering on their campaign promises.

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan on Thursday proposed setting aside money in a special trust fund to cover higher-than-expected pension payments expected to begin in fiscal 2024.
Under the plan, fund deposits and interest earnings would total $377 million by the end of fiscal 2023, according to John Naglick, the city's finance director.
Detroit, which exited the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy in December 2014, has already set aside $70 million for the higher pension payments.

The court-approved bankruptcy exit plan had projected city pension payments to spike to $111 million beginning in fiscal 2024 after years of minimal or no payments by the city. But a subsequent actuarial analysis pegged the payment spike at $200 million or more.
In his annual budget presentation to the city council on Thursday, Duggan also proposed a $1.074 million general fund budget for the fiscal year beginning on July 1 that is slightly smaller than the current spending plan.
The city's credit rating remains deeply in the junk category in the wake of the bankruptcy, which allowed Detroit to shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations.
Naglick said Detroit is eying the sale of about $100 million of bonds backed by state of Michigan transportation funds due the city. The bonds would be issued through the Michigan Finance Authority and would have investment grade ratings, he said.

Practical Tips for Addressing Suspected FMLA Abuse
Thursday, October 13, 2016
With the holiday season approaching, now is a good time to review some practical tips for an employer when addressing suspected abuse of Family Medical Leave Act leave by an employee, although these tips represent best practices year round. An earlier post provided insight into measures an employer can take to prevent the abuse, but what is an employer to do when it receives information indicating the abuse is ongoing or has already happened?
1. Conduct a thorough investigation before contacting the employee. Employers may receive information, directly or indirectly, from other employees which raise suspicions about another employee’s abuse of leave. Those co-workers can be a valuable source of information to the employer. Employers can also use resources such as social media or private investigators, subject to any state law limitations, to gather information.
2. Schedule a meeting with the suspect employee. During this meeting, the employer should inquire about the employee’s reason for absences on the dates in question and whether the employee can provide any information or documents corroborating legitimate FMLA use on those days. The employee’s use of FMLA leave should track the employee’s medical certification upon which FMLA leave was approved.
The employer should provide the employee a fair opportunity to account for his or her leave without “accusation” of abuse from the employer. If the employer has evidence suggesting FMLA fraud or abuse, the employer may ask the employee to explain. The employer may then assess the credibility and truthfulness of the employee’s explanation.
An employer should take caution when scheduling this meeting with the suspect employee. While an employer may be anxious to address suspected abuse of leave, contacting an employee while on leave may lead to an interference claim. Counsel can advise an employer about when and how to address suspected leave abuse with the offending employee.
3. In the event of termination, document everything. Clearly worded employment policies, including social media and leave abuse policies, can legally support an employer’s decision to terminate an employee’s employment for FMLA fraud or abuse. The employer’s investigation and subsequent meeting with the employee should be documented to demonstrate the full and fair investigation conducted by the employer, and that the employer’s ultimate decision was made in good faith, based upon evidence then available to the employer. Such documentation is important for defending against any FMLA interference or retaliation claims that may follow.

The four TV shows you must watch this week
We reveal the programs that everyone should be talking about at the water cooler. - by Matthew Denby
19 Jul 2018
We've all reached 'peak TV', with too much programing cluttering up our schedules! Here is our guide to what to watch over the coming week - and we've chosen something to please everyone.
WHO's Binge List TV podcast team have done plenty of viewing for you, and here's what's hot...
Option 1: UnReal, Season 4
The fourth season of UnReal has been dropped with little notice on Stan – in fact quite a lot has happened with little notice this week, including this show’s unceremonious axing!
Yes, this new season is definitely the last, so start streaming, fans! We in Australia only watched UnReal season three a couple of months ago – but now we have all eight episodes at once.
This time the plot has Everlasting - which is the fictional reality show at the centre of this drama – enduring an All Stars season. And that means we get quite a few blasts from the past.
There are plenty of Love Island-esque vibes here, for people who are missing that show, and who might want to speculate about what goes on behind the scenes. Indeed, there’s plenty of backstage drama this season as bitchiness and toxic behavior go through the roof.
Fans note: this week on WHO's TV podcast, Binge List, we talk to Australian star Adam Demos, who plays hapless returnee August.
Last trip to the well on UnReal
UnReal / Stan
Option 2: Tab Hunter Confidential
With the passing last week of former 1950s and 60s movie and TV heartthrob Tab Hunter, it's a great time to check out Tab Hunter Confidential, an excellent doco on Netflix.
It's a must watch even if you only have the vaguest notion of who he was, as it's a great study of the creation and demolition of a star - but also a first-hand account of the complicated relationship between stars and the celebrity media.
Tab was thrown under the bus by Hollywood power brokers when a tabloid came after then-megastar Rock Hudson over his sexuality. With Tab more disposable to the studio, his pre-fame bust at a gay party was fed to the papers in a deal to snuff out the Rock story.
But stars also manipulate the media and their public to their benefit.
This doco contains fascinating first-hand accounts of how Tab’s dates with starlets were fixed and faked, and his image as a boy next door was crafted.
Things went south eventually, and Tab ended up in dinner theatre - but his career was later revived by cult director John Waters and drag legend Divine!
He ended up happy after a very tough run, rejecting his fame and declining to even watch his old movies on TV.
This is a great examination of fame and the media, and a good introduction to Tab for modern audiences who may not know him well.

Option 3: The Big Bang Theory wedding
The biggest show on broadcast TV is featuring the world’s dorkiest – and perhaps most loved – couple getting hitched. And a bunch of big screen icons making gratuitous guest appearances.
Who would’ve thought that as show about a bunch of nerds would take the TV world by storm? We’ve had 11 seasons of Big Bang Theory, and the biggest nerd of all, Sheldon Cooper is walking down the aisle.
Yes, his wedding to Amy Farrah Fowler is taking place on July 23 on the Nine network, and the Binge List team have seen it! There are quite a few laughs and plenty of charm – it's great to see these two have a happy ending. Even if we don’t really believe that Sheldon suddenly enjoys sex, or wants a life spent compromising with another human being.
Amy gets her man - at last!
Big Bang Theory / CBS
Option 4: Who Is America?
Probably no show has grabbed more headlines this week than the debut of Sacha Baron Cohen’s new comedy series, Who Is America?, which is available on Stan.
If you enjoyed Borat and Bruno, you’ll know what to expect, but this time he’s focusing on the political divisions in America in the Trump era.
Is it out-of-date comedy or can SBC still cause a stir? Depends on your tastes, but there's plenty of awkwardness, humiliation and some big laughs.
New episodes will be dropping every Sunday afternoon, and there are some big names coming up who will be humiliated for your enjoyment.
Should kids have guns? This guy seems to think so.

* Apple gets into maps, burnishes Siri
* Signals Apple remains invested in Macs
* More on mobile expected later (Adds new map service, iPads also to get new Siri, Facebook integration)	
By Poornima Gupta and Alexei Oreskovic	
SAN FRANCISCO, June 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc took the wraps off its own mobile mapping service and made its enhanced Siri voice-search available for iPads as it rolled out souped-up software and hardware on Monday to help it wage war on Google Inc.	
CEO Tim Cook, who took over from late co-founder Steve Jobs last August, spearheaded the unveiling of new services -- such as in-house mapping and beefed-up Siri software -- to help keep at bay Google and its fast-growing Android mobile platform.	
Its new mobile operating software -- the iOS6 -- comes with a mapping system "built from the ground up," said software chief Scott Forstall, sidelining the Google map service that the Internet giant has invested heavily in.	
Apple's map service comes with three-dimensional images of cities called "Flyover" along with real-time traffic updates and turn-by-turn navigation.	
And Siri, the innovative voice-activated iPhone search-feature users have criticized as faulty and inadequate, is now available on iPads and recites a larger database of answers, especially sports, restaurants and movies. It is also integrated into the new mapping service.	
Finally, executives said Apple has integrated No. 1 social network Facebook deeper into the operating system, allowing Siri-users to post photos with voice commands.	
THE EDGE	
Long lines marked the beginning of the week-long annual Worldwide Developers' Conference, where Apple developers rub shoulders with employees, test the latest products and software, and connect with peers. Apple kicked off proceedings by touting its hardware, its biggest edge over Google.	
At 0.7 inches, the new MacBook Pro -- Apple's highest-end laptop -- ranks among the thinnest laptops in the market and will hit store shelves months before many Microsoft Windows-equipped "Ultrabooks." They will employ the "retina" displays that have won strong positive reviews for the new iPad, but start at an eye-popping $2,199 price tag.	
Marketing chief Phil Schiller outlined how the redesigned MacBook Air notebooks, also unveiled at the conference, will be about $100 cheaper on average than predecessors, but sport quicker Intel Corp processors, potentially eating into territory staked out by Hewlett-Packard, Dell Inc and other PC makers.	
Analysts have speculated that the company will begin aggressively competing on price, gradually shrinking the premium its Macs carry in general.	
More than ever, Apple finds itself in a pitched battle with Google: in smartphones, cloud computing, and a never-ending competition to attract the best software developers. That is crucial as Apple looks to draw users deeper into its applications ecosystem.	
Cook told the audience that customers have downloaded more than 30 billion Apple apps so far, choosing from more than 650,000 apps -- the largest library in the industry.	
Battling in many arenas, the rivals employ different weapons. Apple's vise-like grip on its ecosystem - with the closely managed app store and its seamless integration with the hardware - stands in sharp contrast to Google's free-for-all approach.
The open system approach, reminiscent of Microsoft Corp's hugely successful strategy of creating standard-setting software that runs on a variety of hardware, has allowed Android to capture the market lead in smartphones, albeit with nothing close to Apple's profit margins.
Android has also helped create several potent hardware rivals to Apple. Samsung Electronics' Android-driven Galaxy SIII is drawing favorable comparisons to iPhone and Amazon.com Inc's cheaper Kindle Fire is challenging Apple in tablets and digital content.	
The move - years in the making - to replace Google Maps is a dramatic example of how the rivalry between the companies has been evolving.
Google has invested huge sums in mapping technology over the years, and about half its map traffic now comes from iPhones and iPads. Among other things, the traffic from those devices reveals valuable location data that helps improve the mapping service and provides features like real-time traffic reports.

As the gap between the demand for cybersecurity talent and the supply of a professional workforce continues to widen, many have asked the questions: “where will the next generation of front-line defenders rise from?

Tournament Gallop
Composed by L.M.Gottschalk
Arranged by Adam Rutter
£19.50
All performers love a showpiece, and if there isn't one available, they write their own. American born Louis Moreau Gottschalk was a child prodigy and became famous for writing and performing his own piano compositions. Now it's the turn of your band to show off to the crowds with a performance of the 'Tournament Gallop'. Arranged by Adam Rutter, the piece is largely marked 'Presto', though in reality, the idea was that Gottschalk would perform the work as fast as humanly possible! An entertainment special and one audiences will love.
