Great bipartisan resolution on Bolivia on the importance of elections and respecting the will of the people 
  Damn  I really thought you would get it better than most  Unless you legally take this criminal bastard down  there is not going to be any president  after Trump   He will fabricate another emergency to cancel elections

Trump continues to contend that the problem was not his Russian connections  but that the CIA would look at his Russian connections  Trumpsters think it is fine if Russia turned the election for him  and if the internet ends free elections 
The articles of impeachment  though  are  1  Election fraud 2  Bribery 3  Obstruction 4  emoluments 5  Oath of office If that is not enough  neither will naked tyranny be enough  Impeach before the law is further seized  because elections are next  beginning with the Red states 
Study cultivates an eye that can see  and an account can be given  The account usually cannot be received because the categories required are not there  Teach the Americans that data collection leaves elections vulnerable  the simplest things 
   CarriWeatherwax IMPEACHMENT may be important for many reasons we cannot figure  The House should do its job  and subpoena Mueller with his report and the tax forms  Why should we assume there will be fair elections if Trump controls the federal executive  and t  organization reaches into states 
Count on anything possible and useful to any purpose whatsoever being done until the US Congress stops them despite their having 500 Billion dollars  YOU WILL HAVE NO MORE FREE ELECTIONS because the voters themselves are targeted in groups and as individuals 
Have we had a shred of legislation to prevent tech spying on voters and the collection of their  data   compromising voter rights  We are too slavish a people now to have free elections in the internet age  Count on more tyranny  and fascism  if this continues 
But that is what occurs when a nation lets Russia select a tyrant for us  and we allow the obstruction of every effort to fix it  You will have no more free elections  Expect Trump till 2024  the Kushner  Mr  666 
Obama would have called Trump on the election fraud and even fixed the problem then  but lacked bi partisan support  for which we can thank Mitch McConnell  If free elections are over  will McConnell be proud 
  My guess two years ago was to expect a nuclear attack within 4 5 years if we do not get rid of Trump  And fix the internet  Data collection ends elections  A serious tyrant as Putin will have his way with us  We are not responding 
Then  when we try to have elections  Russia can choose for us the man most likely to server her interests and destroy the executive branch  Where is Dick Cheney when we need him

He was a spoiler who only won Ohio during the 2016 elections because his agenda sucked  Nobody can beat   in 2020 because he has been doing everything possible to  MAGA and that is what the people want  Were tired of politicians who say one thing then do another 
   BreitbartNews Yes  that was a pleasant surprise  but I was very disappointed when he walked it back and referred to it as surveillance  Those of us who have been following the story know beyond a doubt that the shadow government was spying on the Trump campaign before and after the elections 
  It is good that she continues to speak with such clarity and candor  Because she is being backed by Democrat Party stalwarts  her public pronouncements should drive patriotic Americans to the polls in droves during the 2020 elections and Republicans should take back the House 
   bubbaprog  POTUS OH my they voted in School Board Elections because the GOP in the SOUTH prior to 1960s WERE BLACK    DUH   
  Voter suppression or tyranny suppression  Democrats been stealing elections since 1803

   bubbaprog  POTUS Go LOOK IT UP for yourself    Tired of doing your freaking Fact Checking  CA and other states allow now citizens to vote in state and local elections since everything CA does is a State Proposition for water  sewage  taxes  etc 
   trumper tantrum  bubbaprog  POTUS  SethAbramson articulated 5 foreign intel agencies worked against Trump during and after the election on  billmaher  Okay can we all be a BIT UPSET that foreigners besides RUSSIA are also working against us in our elections 
   trumper tantrum  bubbaprog  POTUS OH So privacy laws only count for voters but no Mueller report concerning Grand Jury testimony  Federal Govt has obligation to determine if a state is conducting fair elections else were back in Jim Crowe era again    arent we with  NewDEMSlaves

THIS is why Dems will lose badly in the coming elections   
   SalenaZito As someone who stayed up late on election night  it was a nail biter  Republicans in WI are sick of Madison Milwaukee Dems determining our leadership  Imperative that Repubs turn out for all elections   we now have a Dem Gov  who is a clueless puppet of the socialist left 
  But yeah  trump  and Romney   won white millennials  I feel like this is a real blind spot for dem strategists  the lack of realization of how critical people of color are to winning elections 
   AJentleson  CollusionWatch Beyond the not guilty finding  Trump will combine this with his spin on Mueller investigation that Democrats are attempting a coup to circumvent legitimate elections going into 2020

   Mihero  johnpavlovitz  GOP I feel like we are in a race to get to the 2020 elections before all hope is lost    
There has been a lot of talk about whether the 2018 Elections were a  Blue Wave   Well  judging by the US House County results  I think that answer is a resounding yes  Dems gained over 40 seats and flipped some once solid red counties like Maricopa  Orange   amp  Hamilton 
   SenhorRaposa In non state legislative elections he is 3 6  including primaries   In just general elections  he s 0 3  Including losing IL 14 twice in a year  
2016 was one hell of a year at the top of the ballot  but downballot  things remained somewhat stable  Democrats did gain 6 seats this year  but you can really see the groundwork being laid for the 2018 elections in states like California  Arizona   amp  Colorado 
Let s start with the US House elections by county  You can really tell the strength of Colin Peterson  MN 07  with this one

   jennycohn1  HelenArmstrong5 Apples and Oranges comparing Clintons blow job impeachment hearing and all the info that would come out about Trump  Including Mueller report  Dems will lose elections if they dont impeachment  Dorsnt matter if Senate doesnt ratify IMHO
   jennycohn1  HelenArmstrong5 I value your opinion but disagree  History will not be kind to Democrats if they dont impeach  Doesnt matter about senate  Its the public hearings that matter  The senate will look bad but at least the Dems wont look weak  We could lose elections if they dont act

All Democratic 2020 candidates should vow to impose the heaviest sanctions on Russia for the attack on 2016 elections and continued attacks on similar elections around the world  This is the minimum we should be doing to retaliate

Bin Laden ordering attacks on 9 11 stirs up feelings of Patriotism from Trump s base but Putin ordering an attack on 2016 Elections gets a  whatever   Both were acts of War deserved retaliation  Instead Trump made every effort to drop sanctions on Russia asap 
This is like saying the Police  Spy  on criminals  The IC was aware Russia wanted to attack our elections  They were doing their job  Who could have guessed the Trump Campaign would have all those meetings with Russia and fail to report them  Reality is inverted 
Because without building a barn  a barn door can t be left open  EVERY SINGLE US ELECTION  even Foreign Elections b c it is happening everywhere  should use paper ballots and have hand counts recounts  It is too difficult to coordinate cheating without getting caught  Demand it

Trump is still mingling with the head of a country who meddled in our elections  indictments are proof  Comforting those that come against America is a betrayal to the oath he took  Trump is a traitor and the GOP are aiding and abetting said traitor 
   CreechJeff Correct  The previous administration sat down with trump and company to warn them but they already knew and continued to take help from the country that attacked our elections 
Dont tell me trump isnt a racist when he continues to hire them  Dont tell me that trump isnt a sexual predator when he continues to support them  Dont tell me that trumps not a traitor when he continues to take meetings with those who attacked our elections and advise him 
How do we protect the 2020 elections  We know Russia attacked 50 states and that the machines are unable to be audited properly  We have less than 2yrs to make our elections incorruptible  Add this to the list of our fight to protect our Democracy

  Yes   amp  can we start with finding out why  DonaldJTrumpJr didnt get indicted for not reporting to the FBI the attempt of a hostile foreign power to interfere with our democratic elections   amp  also why so many of Trump staff lied about meetings with agents of said hostile power 
  I for one sure want the FBI to be spying on the agents of a hostile foreign power who are in contact with a presidential campaign team  amp  family while intent on interfering with our democratic elections  You  not so much I guess 
  I am glad the FBI was spying on agents from a hostile foreign power trying to interfere with our democratic elections as they were in  friendly  welcomed  amp  treasonous  contact  amp  negotiating with the Trump campaign team  amp  family  You not so much it seems 
  Evidence all Americans know is that Trump Jr  didnt report the attempt of a hostile foreign to interfere with our democratic elections  amp  that Trump staff had 100s of secret meetings w Russian agents then lied about it  Pretty treasonous damning  Surely warrants spying IMO 
   RepDougCollins All Americans already know that Trump Jr  didnt report the attempt of a hostile country to interfere w our democratic elections to the FBI  amp  that your staff had 100s of secret meetings w Russian agents  amp  lied about it  Pretty treasonous damning  The Mueller report will be extra 
   zackwhittaker Spying on a hostile foreign power thats intent on interfering on our elections is definitely something I want the FBI to do  Too bad for Trump if his campaign happened to be in friendly contact with them  Don Jr  shouldve reported the Russians right away  amp  not met w them 
  So far until we see the Mueller report the real treasonous acts are  Don Jr  not immediately going to the FBI to report that a foreign hostile power was trying to interfere with our democratic elections  Then 100s of secret meetings between Russians  amp  your staff  amp  lying about it 
   MariaBartiromo So grateful to the FBI for protecting our democracy  amp  spying on agents of a hostile foreign power  amp  their contacts in your campaign because of their attempt to interfere with our democratic elections  Arent you 
  But wait I thought it was Don Jr who agreed to meet w the Russians to influence the presidential elections instead of reporting immediately to the FBI that a hostile foreign power was threatening our democracy  Are you saying it was Hillary at the Trump tower treasonous meeting 
   LouDobbs  FoxNews Are you saying it was wrong for the FBI to spy on a hostile foreign power who was trying to interfere w our democratic elections  Their job is to protect the American people against the treasonous people who were having secret meetings w Russians  amp  lying about it  I thank them 
  The democrats are rightfully focusing on Trump aiding a foreign power in interfering w our democratic elections as well as potential tax evasions from a president who orchestrated a humanitarian crisis to fulfill his campaign promise  All are extremely important in a democracy

   StLouisBlues Turns out a 501 C 3 is not supposed to be influencing legislation  politics  elections  voting  campaigns  candidates  etc  Check this out  see link below  I m no lawyer  but that s my understanding of what the IRS says on these links 
   BTstl We all need to fill out IRS Form 13909  against BetterTogetherSTL  ReImagineSTL   amp  Mo  Council for a Better Economy  It sure seems like a violation  See my other links  amp  tweets on how they re trying to influence voting  elections  politics  campaigns  candidates   amp  legislation 
  This violation to me is severe    They re forcing a vote  They re not even supposed to be impacting votes  politics  elections  etc  What dopes  Remedies and penalties should be huge  in my view  But I m not the judge or jury 
  Looks like IRS Form 13909 is where to report them  Mo  Council for a Better Economy  BetterTogetherSTL  and ReimagineSTL  trying to impact and influence  elections  voting  politics  campaigns and candidates  legislation  etc  Again I m no lawyer but it seems like a violation 
  BetterTogetherSTL  amp  ReimagineSTL are 501 C 3 Organizations  and are not supposed to impact  amp  influence politics  elections  voting  campaigns  candidates  or legislation  It s against Fed Law  Says it clear as day on IRS website  I m no lawyer  but it sure seems like a violation 
  It appears as though this supports what I m talking about  that 501 C 3 organizations are not supposed to impact politics  voting  elections  etc  and it sure seems as though they are trying to do that 
  Missouri Council for a Better Economy  BetterTogetherSTL  ReimagineSTL are 501 C 3 Organizations  That type of Org is not supposed to impact and influence politics  voting  elections  campaigns  and candidates  Seems like a violation to me  I m against merging city and county 
  Reporting this would probably get BetterTogetherSTL  ReimagineSTL  and Missouri Council for a Better Economy  investigated for trying to influence elections  campaigns  voting  politics  particular candidates  and legislation  All of which are violations  that s my understanding 
  501 C 3 Orgs are not supposed to get involved in voting  elections  politics  campaigns  candidates  or legislation  Sure seems to me that that is exactly what BetterTogetherSTL  ReImagineSTL   amp  Mo  Council for a Better Economy are doing  This is why it s time for IRS Form 13909

  While we are writing letters  Trump is deciding that we don t need elections  he can just become a tyrant  and his kids can inherit the dynasty

   HillaryClinton Our founding fathers created the electoral college specifically to keep one or two large states from regularly dictating national elections   it functioned exactly as intended over 200 yrs ago   you cant just throw that out because you didnt get the result you wanted   sorry 
   ggreenwald Here s the truth  the CIA has for 7 decades  interfered in other countries elections  In 2016  Russia tried to do the same  with very limited resources  and with no discernible impact  Now hypocritical americans can t handle a teensy weensy taste of their own medicine

  The inconceivable truth as with many  winners  of elections worldwide  Democracy is in the dumpster
Problem is they are not coming across the border as you implied they are actually coming in sea ports and airports  Stop with your propaganda  The American people see what you are doing and thats why the GOP is losing elections  So keep it up with your games  The Dems thank you 
Isnt Mr  Schumers logic absurd     to declare a Russian roulette scheme by sacrificial Julian Assange is added to the list of Trump chumps along with Manafort Cohen  amp  Russian spies interfering in 2016 elections 
What are they waiting for   Blue wave was all about holding this administration accountable and the Democrats are acting as if we have all the time in the world to fix this with 2020 elections  Our country is under serious threat  Act now 
Elections are how we should decide who our leaders and our president is  but if the Constitution requires a different response  well see when we see the Mueller report  Pelosi says 
   OH ITS A JOE  pragmacurus  AndrewYang In the last 100 years weve had 25 presidential elections  Dems  12 wins Reps  13 wins Seems like it works pretty well as an equalizer 
   MollyMEP The local elections will be real opportunity to get Greens elected throughout England  and with the expected collapse of the Conservative vote  we can turn large areas from Blue to Green as we did in Buckinghamshire last month 
   moonhare77  PascalLTH If people are going to use the EU elections simply to show their support for either Brexit or Leave  that shows they don t value the EU Parliament 
   moonhare77  PascalLTH  talmyr You don t care about the policies of a particular party  so long as it s anti brexit  You support the EU but are prepared to use the EU Parliament elections as a popularity contest rather than a serious election  That says something about how people see the EU Parliament 
   theblakeroberts  TheGreenParty A vote for  TheGreenParty always counts  and especially in the local elections on May 2nd  If we keep voting for the lesser of two evils  nothing will ever change  Also with the state of both major parties  TheGreenParty will make substantial gains on May 2nd 
  Farage did win the last Euro elections with UKIP  he is the voice of the anti EU movement 
   ZablockiJan The EU elections once again are not likely to be about politics  but about Leave and remain  with the likely Tory collapse  Farage could get the most seats again  Figurehead  yes but an effective orator  Are people pulling his strings  almost certainly 
   ajnmann  britainelects  YouGov Yes  but that s also because the media will portray it as Tory Labour  If the leave parties do well in the EU elections though  they can carry that through to a general election and maybe split the vote in enough constituencies to make it interesting

How can the   throw black  Muslim  and latinx women who are REPRESENTING THEIR PAY and then expect that same demographic to vote in elections on their behalf 
I m not advocating protesting elections  but I AM asking Dem leadership to consider recognizing that WOC and their families and communities will turn out for them if they show basic respect for their colleagues who are receiving race and religious based attacks from the right 
  Real New Yorkers do no post these images because they care about survivors  Just disgusting  BTW  you just  forgot  yesterday that you were a huge fan of Assange who worked with Russia to sabotage our elections so maybe you should never say never   Liar
In an Indonesian city still struggling from last years disasters  upcoming elections are a chance to protest
   kyledcheney yeah  til you start losing elections  then you ll be screaming FRAUD   
   GOPChairwoman  realDonaldTrump youre right  now  what is Crooked Donnie s plan to ensure that nobody meddles in our elections again  oh  thats right  he doesn t have one  because without cheating  fraud  gerrymandering and the electoral college  the GOP wouldn t ever win an election 
  because they know that when more people vote  they lose elections 
  Its shameful the way she refers to 9 11  Her religion is about taking over the governments where they live and people like you are so gullible that it want take many elections for their wish to come true 
   EdKrassen  krassenstein  realDonaldTrump Everbodys telling me there are no need for elections  everbody loves what Im doing
  Dont forget that everyone who is grandfathered in with this new policy is still stopped cold  in terms of advancement  Even those who get to stay cant be advanced into the Officer Corps  or promoted at all  Trump is just arbitrarily ending their careers  ELECTIONS MATTER 
If youre a Democrat in Ohio  and you DIDNT VOTE  guess what  Elections have consequences  Thanks for nothing  And welcome to Gilead

The top five oil and gas companies spend  201M per year lobbying Congress to block policies that would help us stop climate change  Make no mistake  The fight to save our planet is linked to the fight for bold campaign finance reform that gets PACs  amp  lobbyists out of elections

How should we approach the 2020 US Elections  Why  like   does  of course  Bob says  I want to hear a pitch that isnt grounded in the contempt of others 
  1st you must realize that there are 2 things conflata did that are being called Russia gate  The excuses and deflection of the Hillary losers crying  and the actual efforts to undermine our elections 
  You lied about Seth Rich  Why is it that you are silent about Reality Winner  She sits in prison for showing us the facts to prove it while you squirm to evade accountability for ratf   ing elections and propagandizing to divide progressives  Oops  you agreed to help hack  Karma 
Remember the best thing about the 2016 elections were the faces of the liberals 
  What McConnell doesn t realize is that it may be too late for free trump takes over the courts  he can break the law and condemn those who don t lie  amp  break the law with him He is in control Congress  amp  judicial are his  McConnell allowed it to happen 
   SpeakerPelosi I agree  He is putting people in place for his to remain an autocrat without elections  They will lie and break the law for him  He has taken over the courts  Congress and we no longer have three branches of government  It may be too late already  I sure hope not 
  Can tell that we are going to see the most vicious and cruel Presidential elections in our country s history 
Democrats  we need money and volunteers so we can win elections and save the country  Please help  Many people  meh  Trump Republicans  now that we ve won elections  we re going to act like fascists  Many people  why don t the Democrats DO something  
 Modi Govt is the Worst Govt India has ever had in last 70 years   2019 elections will be the last elections Because if Modi wins this time  he will control all institutions  India will become a Fascist state Save India  Save Democracy 
30  EVMs not working in Andhra that is Almost 8000 machines    is absolutely right  These elections are already a farce   ncbn
Under Modi  Hate speech began to proliferate  So did the use of internet trolls to shut down critics    began rewriting history books  lopping out sections on Muslim rulers  changing official place names to Hindu from Muslim  
 The EC baulked  but eventually agreed to advance them to December 2002   The similarities do not end there  After winning the elections  Modi did not rest on his laurels  Instead the Gujarat police kept up a drumbeat of no fewer than 22 encounters  in many of which the
many of whom sported saffron scares and tikas as they went about doing Gods work  And even before the corpses had been disposed of  he had asked the Election Commission to advance the date of the state elections from March 2003 to July 2002 
Well said  He wanted to say Sikhs too but elections still remaining in Punjab no  
   realDonaldTrump You really are either stupid or ignorant  Immigrants even people holding green cards like Melania don t get to vote in elections  On y US citizens do  Maybe you should look that up it is in the constitution and is law

   realDonaldTrump  POTUS AHH right the state that had the voter fraud issue from th republicans and have to do the elections over great place very honest
  This man strikes me as absolutely  arrogant   Just that disdainful way he answered  Like  you are really boring me   There are two answers to this mess  2020 elections and Mitch McConnell  McConnell has to go   2020Elections
  The only answer I have to this is    2020 elections  He simply has to go  He and Mitch McConnell  because he is aiding and abetting  These clips are frightening as hell   2020Elections

We want Assange to be charged for his role in the 2016 elections  AG Barr needs to Indict him on hacking the 2016 election in concert with the Russians  If Barr is the Attorney General then he needs to do his job and act like an Attorney General for the American people  Not Trump

  The Russians and Chinese are going to interfere in our elections  They are hostile foreign governments that s what they do  Here our government is spying on our citizens and being used against political opponents  Our Constitution regulates our government  This is abuse of power 
   sh4joy Bernie did meet with Russians and sought financial support from Russians  He gave them info about our elections  This is not how an American ever conducts himself with an enemy nation 
  Looking forward to knowing what involvement Trump  amp  family had in Russian interference in our elections to confirm whether Trumps election is even legitimate

It seems Obama settled Muslim immigrants in concentrated areas so that they could win local elections  become district representatives and enter Congress  Certainly true of Tlaib and Omar 
It may have gone back a little further   but Obama methodically steered really large numbers of Muslims into specific districts over his administration  They are there  locked and loaded  And we ll probably have a few more win district elections  Glenn Beck  youtube  chalkboard

Accepter d aller aux lections avec la Kabilie pour les vincer du pouvoir tait comme se jeter d un gratte ciel et attendre les aides des anges pour tre sauv dans les hauteurs

  Les rsultants de la prsidentielle de la rpublique n ont ils pas t non plus une autre farce lectorale  Plus 3 mois aprs les lections  la  cenirdc est incapable de tracer les rsultats finaux  En votre qualit d expert  en tes vous fier  Vous faites la politique d autruche

  Alex  as I watched people at the rally in Israel prior to elections  they had Trump flags in the crowd  Youd certainly expect the Jewish of all people to know better  Now that Trump has made it impossible for many to believe the truth I suspect our freedom is in peril

  Ask him what we should do if trump suspends elections  Its in the realm of possibility since no one is enforcing the rule of law
  At this point  well be lucky to have elections in 2020

   JaredTBen  AndrewYang Ok then  we should continue to support an antiquated electoral system for our highest office  a system that we do not use in any other election and that has twice in the last 5 elections given the presidency to the popular vote loser because some voters might feel marginalized 
  You have it exactly backwards  The unprincipled stance is arguing that some Americans votes should count  MUCH  more than others in elections of our President  It is very principled to insist that everyone citizens vote counts the same in POTUS elections 
   elpajaronegro  mama2fluffs  olgaNYC1211 That is my biggest fear  We have to protect our elections  Otherwise  this will keep happening 
   justinillusion9  olgaNYC1211 I m not saying everything is fine  After 2016  it should be obvious to everyone that we have to secure our elections  Elections are run by the federal government  though  Each state handles their own elections  This makes the results of the 2018 elections even more important 
  This is not helpful  Democracies die when the public loses confidence in the legitimacy of their elections  Trump is extremely dangerous  Thank God he does not control our elections  As you know  they are controlled by the states  We gained governors  seats in 2018  He will lose

  Both are still claiming to be victorious in the elections they LOST

  Tax scams seem to be the in thing for the Trump family  No wonder czar Trump wont reveal his 6 years of tax reports  He will get Barr to stall long enough to get him past the 2020 elections  He wont even reveal his no plan health care until after 2020 election 
  Amazing how people can overlook so many transgressions of this president  He was not exonerated  as he claims by this report  There are so many allegations being investigated  Hope these supporters will learn the truth about Trump before the 2020 elections

Party Primary can allow a small but active group to tilt the primary toward a candidate preferred by fewer  Moderate  party line voters have lower turn out in primary elections  and independent voters can t vote  so it s vulnerable to propaganda and polarized politics

  I mean  I even read the piece where Deepak Obhrai said the Act would be enforced by Elections Canada  How funny is that  Because now we know it isn t enforced at all  by anyone 
  Canadian law is full of similar and  unenforceable  statues  To choose simply one example  the Elections Act requires Officers and agents to perform various duties  but says nothing about what happens if they don t  Ignoring the law should never be taken lightly 
   acoyne Dick man  if one reads the Acts one will find that almost all laws are without enforcement mechanisms  To choose but one example  the Elections Act has no  or else  clauses  Our society and way of life is built on following laws based on the honour system 
   Cofadad  kady The 49 8 vote is mandatory by law  The language is unambiguous  If the caucus chair can simply declare a consensus based on nothing at all then we should also cancel all of our elections  and let the prime minister write a letter declaring himself the winner 
  The statute isn t clear and doesn t prescribe an enforcement mechanism  therefore it can be ignored  Applying this same standard  most of the Elections Act can also be ignored  and a letter from a minister summarizing the national consensus could substitute for a vote

  Lying Corrupt Trump News  known as Fox  has done more to harm the minds of Americans  than any other source in our nations history  Unfortunately these people vote and elections have consequences  Today the world doesnt recognize America   I dont recognize America 
The face of the government will be civilian    the real power will still be the Army  elections need to be organized ASAP 
   scottsantens Because given past elections its the voice of the small guy which matters  not the electoral college and other machinations
  Oh   i was hoping it was because he stopped supporting racist rapists who cheat at elections 
I would argue this is one of the most important rulings of our time  We need accountability if democracy is to survive  which also means cancelling referendums and elections if illegality and lies were proven to be used in the campaign 
  Sucks for you then that  SpeakerPelosi is running the show and this will never happen  Elections have consequences Matt  Prepare to face yours next 
Im good at cursing too  Particularly after Ive had an old monk or two  Maybe I should stand for elections  and curse the constitution and all that stands in my way 
   GOPChairwoman needs to focus on winning elections instead of inserting herself in political commentary and spending her time on social media

Elections Analyst Breaks Down the Numbers on Who is Most Likely To Face Trump in 2020 Senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics  Sean Trende  broke down which Democrats had the best chance of clinching the partys 2020 presidential nominatio   
  But colluding with the enemy to be elected  failure of the members of a major political party to conduct oversight  seeking to win elections by cheating in multitudinous ways   amp  committing a never ending series of atrocities is ok   GOP  The SANE people of America deserve better

Israel central elections committee announced final results  Likud 36  Blue White with 35 seats  Shas 8 UTJ   7  Labor   6  Hadash Ta al 6  Kulanu 5  Yisrael Beytenu 5  United Right has 4 seats  Meretz 4 seats and Ra am Balad wins 4 seats as well  Blocs remain 65 55 
Final results by Israeli Central Elections Committee are not in yet and it matters because itll be very different if Netanyahu has a 64 seat bloc and depend on Leibermans Israel Betenu party or a 67 seat bloc which will allow him much more latitude

Dems accuse Pres Trump of hiring an AG to do his will  Well look at history  John F Kennedy hired Robert Kennedy as AG and told him to go after the bad guys  The Mob  In this case the Dems are the Bad Guys  Remember what Obama said  elections have consequences   
 Great news      celebrates Fox Business goof that mistakenly added 12  to his approval via  usatoday
Maybe   should have called for elections at the first sign it was about to crash  It worked for Bibi 
   dmcdowell727  KellyannePolls  AlexGangitano This has a lot to do with the fact the Dems strongly dislike Trump but its also the question of how is our democracy going to survive if our President doesnt stand up against other countries highjacking our elections  We deserve answers not more questions
   dmcdowell727  KellyannePolls  AlexGangitano Ok with all of that being said do you think we as the American people deserve answers and proof that our elections were not tampered with during the 2016 election 
   HPSelf The American people deserve the truth  not just about this  They deserve to know the truth all the way down to their local courthouse where elections are rigged  the constitution is ignored  humans are trafficked to rob them steal kids rob tax payers  amp  fill prisons for profit 
Many of these gangs are headed by Democrats  many of these gangs are infested with Democrats  yet nothing is said or done  These are the people responsible for rigging local elections trafficking children  amp  filling corporate jails with innocent people  amp  parents 
  What they ve been doing with our public offices legislative seat  the courts  amp  agencies that police all is treasonous  This is no longer a Gov  it is a monopoly being used to rig elections steal wealth   imprison  amp  enslave 
These organized crime rings seized thousands of courthouses they ve used to traffick countless children their parents  rigged countless elections  imprisoned countless innocent people stolen fortunes in private  amp  public wealth  they are a threat to our national security 
Ill break my self imposed silence for a second to say that  1  Assange was arrested for hacking  Thats not journalism  Thats a breach of security  2  He compromised the 2016 elections by smearing Clinton  Hes why we have Trump  3  Hes also an accused rapist  The end

  And you want to throw 180 million off their insurance  AND Trump us doing nothing with insurance until after the 2020 elections  So YOU LIE

I can imagine this position taking hold  amp  hardening among erstwhile Remainers  and Brexiteers deciding their only hope is a last stand whereby they try to block EU elections and thus force either a last minute deal in the days hours before June 1  or a no deal crash out on June 1
But whats true  I think  is that May 22   June 1 represents the last  amp  only genuine cliff edge deadline  Its the one deadline that seemingly cant be extended  if no elections are held  So its the last moment of possible leverage for the hardest of hard liners  it seems to me 
Does   have to affirmatively approve the EU elections  or can the govt conduct those without MPs voting yes  Because if MPs have to vote yes  which theyre not very good at lately   Id give it a  30  chance this May 22 June 1 clause becomes an actual problem 
I dont know  though  if theres any feasible way for them to block European elections  Seems like a last minute   might be needed  unless MPs have a say in EU election approval  amp  a bunch of anti no deal MPs can be tricked into setting this into motion by voting no

  When a hostile foreign nation manipulates our elections and has an overwhelming amount of communication with an American campaign  its the duty of the FBI to investigate  Thats not spying   its keeping our country safe

   AriBerman I assume since you are on all the dem lists you volunteered  Did not enough people volunteer to get out the vote for her  What was voter turnout for Dems  I m curious  in PA with upcoming judicial elections 
   NateSilver538 Arguably so  But she was  electable   proven by nearly winning  Would another candidate have done better  Probably  but that candidate would have had other weaknesses also  Partisanship remains the biggest driver of presidential elections 
   NateSilver538 Yes  elections can be surprising  It is clear both parties will fight hard to win  Any nominee will have weaknesses  and will be attacked over them  What will have net salience is  very  hard to predict  What attracts some voters may repel others 
  I would add judges  But Prosecutors are the first line  They can throw out bad cases and they decide charges  Judges do not have to set bail for poor ppl who are a risk to communities  but they build their reps on being tough  too  Importance of local elections
