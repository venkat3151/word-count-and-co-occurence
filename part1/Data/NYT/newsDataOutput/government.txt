LONDON   An end to austerity in Britain does not mean all government departments will see their budgets keep pace with inflation  Conservative finance minister Philip Hammond said on Friday Last year Hammond announced that years of self enforced thrift over government spending was coming to an end  a claim parliament s Treasury Committee criticised as  imprecise  and lacking in detail On Friday he spelled out more about what an end to austerity would mean for a multi year review of government spending due towards the end of the year alongside his annual budget  All Spending Reviews are about prioritisation and efficiency  and it would be odd to define ending austerity as meaning that every department sees an annual real terms increase in its budget   Hammond said in a letter to the chair of the Treasury Committee  Nicky Morgan Day to day spending on public services was likely to rise 1 2 percent a year above inflation over the coming years  compared with an average real terms fall of 1 3 percent a year between 2015 and 2020  and double that in the five years before The last spending review before the financial crisis  conducted by a Labour government in 2007  envisaged real terms cuts to spending on foreign affairs  justice  and the administration of pensions and social benefits  Delivering faster job growth  a higher minimum wage and lower income tax bills for many workers also counted towards ending austerity  Hammond added Morgan said Hammond s comment was  noteworthy  Britain s budget deficit looks on track to drop to its lowest since 2001 02 at just over 1 percent of national income in the 2018 19 financial year that has just ended  down from 10 percent just after the global financial crisis in 2009 10 Last month  Hammond said he could free billions of pounds for extra public spending or tax cuts  as long as parliament resolves its Brexit impasse Britain could ask the European Union for a long Brexit delay next week if crisis talks between Prime Minister Theresa May s government and the opposition Labour Party fail to find a way out of the impasse over the divorce from the European Union It is nearly three years since the United Kingdom shocked the world by voting 52 percent to 48 to leave the bloc  Supporters of Brexit fear betrayal and opponents are pushing for another referendum Hammond last month repeated his forecast that there would be a Brexit deal  dividend  as companies regained confidence  despite criticism from the Treasury Committee over his use of the phrase   Editing by David Milliken

JERUSALEM   Benjamin Netanyahu  Israel s conservative prime minister for the past decade  appeared poised to win a fourth consecutive term in office  and a fifth overall  according to preliminary results early on Wednesday Both Mr  Netanyahu and his chief rival  Benny Gantz  a centrist former military chief  declared victory after Tuesday s parliamentary election  appearing to win the same number of seats in the Israeli parliament  But a count of the broader blocs needed to form a coalition government appeared to give Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party a clear advantage over Mr  Gantz s Blue and White Mr  Netanyahu now seems all but sure to surpass the nation s founding leader  David Ben Gurion  as Israel s longest serving prime minister Victory would also provide Mr  Netanyahu  69  with a renewed mandate as he battles a looming indictment on charges of bribery and corruption A dominant global player who has built a strong economy  Mr  Netanyahu is widely credited with having kept the country secure and delivered a series of long sought diplomatic victories  many of them thanks to President Trump Regardless of the outcome  Mr  Gantz s strong performance was a remarkable achievement for a political newcomer and a brand new party  Mr  Gantz  a career soldier who retired as chief of staff in 2015  entered politics last year for the first time  joining forces with two other former army chiefs in an effort to blunt Mr  Netanyahu s claim that only he could keep Israel safe More than a million Israelis appeared to have voted for Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party  placing it in the position of being the main alternative to Israel s right wing  a spot once held by the Labor Party ImageSupporters of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesInitial exit polls had projected a muddled outcome  and many Israelis went to bed on Tuesday suspended in a post ballot twilight zone  The final tally may not be known until the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients are counted later this week The exit polls of the three main television channels were sufficiently disparate that both sides claimed victory  This is a night of tremendous victory   Mr  Netanyahu said after entering a jubilant campaign celebration around 2 a m  to cheers and chants of  Bibi  king of Israel   I believe that the Lord and history have given the people of Israel another opportunity  a golden opportunity to turn our country into a strong nation  among the strongest nations of the world   he said He said he expected to forge a new coalition with the right wing parties he called his  natural partners   but that he intended to be  the prime minister of all the citizens of Israel  Earlier  Mr  Gantz entered a packed election night headquarters in Tel Aviv to thunderous cheers  declaring   We are the winners   He promised to be  the prime minister of everyone and not just of those who voted for us   and argued  when early exit polls had him in the lead  that the largest party should be the one granted the mandate to form the next government By dawn  Likud and Blue and White appeared to have won at least 35 seats each in the 120 seat parliament  But the right wing and religious parties together commanded a potential majority of at least 65 seats  leaving the center left bloc trailing far behind with 55 President Reuven Rivlin is expected in the next few days to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority ImageSupporters of Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditLior Mizrahi Getty ImagesAs Mr  Netanyahu has drifted steadily to the right  the left has migrated to the center  after years of violence in the second Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s and the absence of a viable peace process since Mr  Netanyahu has benefited from strong support from President Trump  who in the past two years has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal  recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital and just two weeks ago recognized Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights The Trump administration weighed in again on Monday  declaring the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization  By Monday night in Israel  Mr  Netanyahu was boasting on Twitter in Hebrew   but not in English   that this was in fulfillment of  another important request of mine  But Mr  Netanyahu s pursuit of a fourth consecutive term came as he faces indictment for bribery and other corruption charges  The evidence in those cases  which was kept under wraps until after the election to avoid leaks that could tilt the contest against Mr  Netanyahu  are now to be turned over to lawyers in the case  meaning Mr  Netanyahu could be plagued by damaging reports while he tries to assemble a coalition And it could be difficult for him to remain in office once formal criminal charges are lodged against him  possibly as soon as late summer Mr  Netanyahu spent much of the past year undermining law enforcement officials and the gatekeepers of Israel s liberal democracy  railing against the police  the attorney general and what he called the  leftist  mainstream media  trying to delegitimize his critics and organizations working for Palestinian rights  His government has also worked to curb the powers of the Supreme Court Even as Mr  Netanyahu forged diplomatic ties and trading partnerships with new countries  he stymied any prospect of a resolution of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  aided by a weak  divided and at times recalcitrant Palestinian leadership  Veering farther to the right in the final days of the election campaign  he pledged to start annexing parts of the occupied West Bank if re elected  a move he had long resisted He was widely expected in his coalition negotiations to try to trade passage of annexation laws for retroactive immunity to prosecution in the corruption cases against him ImageA woman voting in Ramat Gan on Tuesday  If the vote remains close  it may come down to the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients counted later this week CreditOded Balilty Associated PressBut Israelis as a whole have lost faith in a two state solution  polls show  and the election seemed to bear that out For many Palestinians  the distinctions between Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz were inconsequential Saeb Erekat  the chief Palestinian negotiator  pointed to one exit poll showing that only 18 of the Parliament s members still supported a two state solution  calling this  a consequence of the culture of impunity granted to Israel   What the exit polls suggest is that Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo   he said   They have said  no  to peace and  yes  to the occupation  Early analysis showed a historically low turnout among Arab citizens of Israel  many of whom boycotted the vote out of disillusionment with Israeli politics and with their own politicians By nightfall Arab leaders were frantically trying to rally their supporters  mosques were broadcasting appeals from minaret loudspeakers  and a last minute surge of participation seemed to materialize in some predominantly Arab towns  though that was not captured in exit polls Despite the broad margin of support for a Netanyahu government  coalition negotiations may still prove difficult  with several small parties acting as kingmakers and Mr  Netanyahu vulnerable to political extortion  The question is whether people will climb down from their trees or not   said Abraham Diskin  a professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  referring to the lofty demands and conditions some party leaders have already placed on entering a coalition Mr  Gantz and his allies in the Blue and White alliance have pledged not to join a government with a prime minister facing indictment ImageLaborers hanging a campaign banner depicting Mr  Netanyahu  center  with other candidates of his Likud party  in Jerusalem last month CreditAmmar Awad ReutersLike most Israeli election campaigns  this one ripped open the fissures in Israeli society  With Mr  Netanyahu facing indictment and battling for his political survival against Mr  Gantz  the most credible challenger in a decade  many Israelis said it was the nastiest and most divisive race they could recall With three former army chiefs in Blue and White s top four slots  Mr  Netanyahu was unable to rely on his usual politics of fear  presenting himself as the only candidate able to provide Israelis with security Instead  his campaign focused largely on perceived enemies within Mr  Netanyahu fanned the flames of anti Arab sentiment  warning Israelis that Mr  Gantz would  hand over parts of the homeland to the Arabs   He also joined forces with a racist faction  one of whose members was ultimately barred from running in the election by the Supreme Court On Election Day  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling places in Arab towns in what they said was an effort to capture evidence of any irregularities  but Arab leaders called it a blatant attempt at voter intimidation The dwindling left  for its part  accused Blue and White of being right wing  saying that it was conspiring to join a Netanyahu government Mr  Netanyahu tried to cast the race as one between an experienced world leader and an unproven political novice  His party raised questions about Mr  Gantz s sexual propriety  his vulnerability to extortion by the Iranians after his cellphone was apparently breached  and even his mental stability Mr  Gantz s party said it wanted to put Israel back on course  It fought Mr  Netanyahu s polarization with promises of restoring a sense of unity  decency and democratic values The fate of smaller parties at both ends of the spectrum was unclear and could still prove significant  It s been a long night   Mr  Netanyahu said at his post midnight rally   And it will be a long day waiting for the true results

KAMPALA  Uganda   Rival security forces clashed in Sudan on Tuesday as huge crowds of protesters kept up their vigil outside army headquarters to call for the overthrow of the country s longtime authoritarian president  Omar Hassan al Bashir Seven people were killed on Tuesday  said Sara Abdelgalil  a spokeswoman for the Sudanese Professionals Association  which is organizing the protests The eruption of violence between different armed government forces is a major development in the four month long protest movement against the president  said Magdi el Gizouli  a fellow at the Rift Valley Institute  a think tank based in Kenya  In a way  it has been turned into an internal dilemma between security forces   said Mr  el Gizouli  who is Sudanese  The worse case scenario is that this military security establishment breaks down and they fail to resolve what is now becoming a conflict within   he added The intermittent fighting between different agencies within the country s security forces raises concerns that Sudan could descend into anarchy  That fear is especially acute now because two neighboring nations   Libya and South Sudan   are convulsed by civil war and chaos The protests broke out in December over a surge in the price of bread and quickly escalated into the biggest challenge yet to the three decade rule of Mr  al Bashir  He came to power in a military and Islamist backed coup in 1989 and for much of that time  he has been regarded as a pariah in the West Sudan became a haven for international terrorists in the 1990s   it hosted Osama bin Laden for a

m  when paramilitary forces loyal to Mr  al Bashir opened fire on the protesters in front of the army headquarters  according to one protester  a doctor in his mid 20s Soldiers who are part of the regular army opened up gates to allow protesters to get to safety within the large military compound that is not only home to army headquarters  but to Mr  al Bashir s residence as well  said the doctor  who asked to be identified only by his initials  A M E   citing safety concerns The army responded to the attack by the paramilitary forces with gunfire and they shot about six of them  according to the doctor  who provided a video of protesters huddled on the ground in the dark as gunfire sounded all around them Dr  Mohamed Eisa  a spokesman for the Sudanese American Physicians Association  said that about 22 people   including five soldiers   have been killed since the protests swelled on Saturday  Dr  Eisa  who is based in Cleveland  said his group s tally is based on reports from doctors in Khartoum  the capital Ms  Abdelgalil  the spokeswoman for the protest organizers  said   The positive emerging development is that some of the army forces are protecting the civilians  There was similar fighting between rival security forces early Monday as well  a different witness said After protests broke out in December  Mr  al Bashir s feared National Intelligence and Security Service sought to suppress them with tear gas  detentions  and sometimes live ammunition  By the middle of March  60 protesters had been killed  according to the New York based group Physicians for Human Rights The protests gained momentum over the weekend  when marchers chose a new demonstration route and reached army headquarters with little resistance  There they discovered that individual army soldiers guarding the compound were sympathetic  The army soldiers at times blocked the efforts of the National Intelligence and Security Service to disperse the protesters

since Saturday  At its height  organizers have estimated that hundreds of thousands of protesters have been in the streets The protesters have praised the army for protecting them  In phone interviews  several protesters have begun to express hope that the army will force Mr  al Bashir s ouster Mr  el Gizouli said that while the protesters in Khartoum may view the army favorably  the army is hardly a unifying force beyond Sudan s heartland  Across the country s periphery  the military has sown terror while fighting rebels  One must be reminded that it s the same army accused of treacherous crimes   he said During his long rule  Mr  al Bashir has bolstered security forces outside the military s command structures   which has prevented any one security organ from growing powerful enough to challenge him  He has built up the National Intelligence and Security Service and also supported the Arab militias known as janjaweed that have more recently been constituted as the Rapid Support Forces Those forces were seen moving into Khartoum in recent days and setting up roadblocks  according to witnesses The doctor who witnessed the shooting said that he had spoken to some of the soldiers who let the protesters take cover inside army headquarters  and it was clear these soldiers were acting against their orders The doctor added that one of the soldiers said he feared that all those who disobeyed orders will be executed if this movement fails In a joint statement made through the United States Embassy in Khartoum on Tuesday  the United States  Britain and Norway called on the Sudanese authorities to respond to the demands of the protesters and prepare for a  political transition   The Sudanese people are demanding a transition to a political system that is inclusive and has greater legitimacy   the statement read   The Sudanese authorities must now respond and deliver a credible plan for this political transition  Failing to do so risks causing greater instability   

Faced with an expanding measles outbreak  Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York declared a public health emergency on Tuesday and ordered a program of mandatory vaccination in parts of Brooklyn Such a health order is rare but not unheard of in American history  medical experts said  It has occurred several times  The Supreme Court ruled more than a century ago that mandatory vaccination was legal  although the court drew a distinction between punishing citizens for refusing and actually vaccinating them by force Nonetheless  both of those tactics have been imposed in the past 120 years   as long ago as a 1900 plague outbreak in San Francisco  and as recently as a measles outbreak in Philadelphia in 1991  Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  The New York vaccination order is written in a way that seems to leave open both possibilities  depending on how strictly the city chooses to enforce it  Mayor de Blasio said New Yorkers in the affected neighborhoods who refuse to let themselves or their children be vaccinated could be fined  1 000  But the order issued by the health commissioner  Dr  Oxiris Barbot  said anyone who has not been vaccinated and cannot prove they are immune to measles or produce a medical exemption  shall be vaccinated   Below the commissioner s signature   outside the actual text of the order   is an added warning saying failure to comply is a misdemeanor and can lead to fines or imprisonment  On Tuesday  Dr  Barbot said persistent refusals would be handled on a  case by case basis  and we ll have to confer with our legal counsel  The defining case in the field  according to Daniel A  Salmon  director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health  is the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in Jacobson v  Massachusetts The court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination on the grounds that  when danger loomed  an individual s freedom could be subordinated to the common good The plaintiff  Henning Jacobson  was a Cambridge  Mass   pastor who had been vaccinated against smallpox as a child in Sweden and claimed it had caused him lifelong suffering  He also argued that vaccination was an  invasion of his liberty  under the 14th Amendment  During a smallpox outbreak  he refused to let himself or his son be vaccinated and was fined  5 Massachusetts was then one of 11 states with compulsory vaccination laws  but it did not allow vaccination by force  By a 7 to 2 vote  the court let the fine stand and said imprisonment could also have been imposed But Justice John Harlan wrote for the majority that individuals could not be forcibly vaccinated Yet vaccination by force was used in 1991 in Philadelphia  said Dr  Paul A  Offit  director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia A measles outbreak that year infected over 1 400 people and killed several children  It had begun in two fundamentalist churches that rejected modern medicine and practiced faith healing  A court ordered that the children in those churches be vaccinated  Their families did not resist  They were a peaceful lot   Dr  Offit recalled   Once it was the law of the city  they realized it and they were pretty placid about it   One church s pastor had vaccinated her dog because the law required it  he said  yet her son died of an infection with Hib bacteria  which is prevented by a vaccine routinely given to children at two months  ImageResidents and police gathered outside a library in Brooklyn where Mayor de Blasio made the announcement CreditJohn Taggart for The New York TimesCity and state health commissioners often have vast powers  Most public health laws were written in the 19th century  when cities were regularly swept by waves of cholera  yellow fever and smallpox that killed thousands In the 1892 cholera outbreak  New York City s health commissioner  Dr  Cyrus Edson  was asked by a congressional committee what the limits of his powers were  He answered that he could even seize City Hall and turn it into a hospital In the 1990s  when a few New Yorkers with multi drug resistant tuberculosis   mostly homeless men   refused to take antibiotics  they were held involuntarily in a locked ward of Bellevue Hospital and forced to take medicine until they were no longer contagious Forced vaccination  however  is more politically sensitive than quarantines or forced treatment  Vaccines are given to healthy persons   sometimes infants   instead of to those who are sick and clearly endangering others Smallpox vaccination was made mandatory in parts of Europe as early as 1806  but the first attempt at forced vaccination in this country occurred in San Francisco s Chinatown in 1900  The city nearly exploded into riots  said Dr  Howard Markel  director of the University of Michigan s Center for the History of Medicine Measles Outbreak Explained  Your Questions AnsweredThe disease was declared eliminated in 2000  So far this year  there have been more than 100 cases  Feb  20  2019As he described it in his book  When Germs Travel   the entire neighborhood was cordoned off by police on March 7  1900  less than 24 hours after local health officials tentatively concluded that a scrap wood dealer found dead in a basement cot in a dime a night boardinghouse had perished from plague Plague was then common in China and in 1899 had reached Honolulu s Chinatown  A  controlled burn  of a few plague infested houses ordered by the city board of health had gotten out of control and burned down 4 000 houses  leaving thousands homeless Anti Chinese prejudice was rampant in California  and the Chinese were terrified that what had happened in Hawaii would be repeated The San Francisco quarantine was lifted on March 9  in part because employers needed their workers  Health inspectors and police began searching the community for the sick  beating anyone who resisted In May  the surgeon general in Washington telegraphed orders that federal health officials should take over response to the outbreak  cordon off Chinatown again  prevent all Chinese and Japanese people from leaving the city  disinfect all their homes   and inoculate them all with an experimental plague vaccine  The national panic was so great that the secretary of the Treasury briefly issued orders that all Asians could be denied transport by common carrier anywhere in the country  The vaccine had been invented just three years earlier by Waldemar Haffkine  an Orthodox Jew who had been driven out of Russia by anti Semitism and had moved his laboratory to India The second quarantine went on for weeks  and Chinatown faced starvation until local merchants donated food  The Chinese press reported that the Haffkine vaccine had killed some Indians and that a few Chinatown residents who accepted it had fallen ill The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association  a civic group  sued  and a federal district judge stopped the vaccinations  saying the order singled out Asians for no medical reason  Ultimately  the vaccination effort was dropped because the governor asked President William McKinley to step in  The local federal health official had started issuing orders so sweeping that they effectively prevented all Californians from leaving the state without his permission Even fining people for refusing to be vaccinated has a complex history  Dr  Salmon said  In Britain  he noted  fines have sometimes been imposed repeatedly for repeated refusals  People lost their houses and became martyrs   he said Also  fines create inequities because some can afford them and some cannot   You end up punishing people based on their ability to pay   Dr  Salmon said There is almost always a backlash  In Britain  the Vaccination Act of 1853 galvanized the creation of an anti vaccination movement  and in the United States  the Anti Vaccination League of America was founded three years after Jacobson v  Massachusetts was decided Earlier reporting on the measles outbreakNew York Declares Measles Emergency  Requiring Vaccinations in Parts of BrooklynApril 9  2019

WASHINGTON   The top federal ethics watchdog said on Thursday that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s sale of his stake in a film production business to his wife did not comply with federal ethics rules  and it would not certify his 2018 financial disclosure report as a result Although Mr  Mnuchin will not face penalties for failing to comply  he has been required to rewrite his federal ethics agreement and to promise to recuse himself from government matters that could affect his wife s business Mr  Mnuchin in 2017 sold his stake in StormChaser Partners to his then fiance  Louise Linton  as part of a series of divestments before becoming Treasury secretary  Since they are now married  government ethics rules consider the asset to be owned by Mr  Mnuchin  potentially creating a conflict of interest for an official who has been negotiating for expanded access for the movie industry as part of trade talks with China The controversy over Mr  Mnuchin s finances has become an unwanted distraction in recent weeks as the Trump administration has been engaged in intense negotiations with China on a wide range of trade matters  While Robert Lighthizer  President Trump s top trade official  has been leading the talks  Mr  Mnuchin has been the point person for promoting the film industry because of his background as a Hollywood producer and investor Mr  Mnuchin said last month at a Senate hearing that he was told by Treasury ethics officials that he was allowed to sell his stake in StormChaser to Ms  Linton  an actress and producer  However  the Office of Government Ethics was not made aware of that guidance and had not approved it In a letter to Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Finance Committee  the ethics office said that it could not certify Mr  Mnuchin s report but that because he had modified his ethics agreement and agreed to recuse himself from matters that might affect StormChaser s film business  he and Ms  Linton could continue to hold the asset Several Trump administration officials have faced red flags and ethical questions over their financial holdings  In February  the ethics office declined to certify the 2018 financial disclosure of Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  because of an inaccuracy in his report The Treasury s assistant general counsel  Brian J  Sonfield  said that the department s former top ethics official had cleared Mr  Mnuchin s arrangement  according to a letter he wrote this week to Emory Rounds  the director of the ethics office  He said that the Treasury believes that Ms  Linton s ownership of the business is  consistent with all applicable ethics laws and regulations  In a separate letter to Mr  Sonfield this week  Mr  Mnuchin wrote that  unless he receives a written waiver  he will recuse himself from any government activity that could benefit StormChaser s movie business  He added that StormChaser did not own or have financial interests in films that are being marketed internationally  He also said he would recuse himself from any tax policy matters that could affect the kinds of independent films that StormChaser holds  If while I am secretary the nature of StormChaser s business practices or the types of films it owns or produces changes  I will seek further guidance from the department s ethics official  who will consult with O G E    Mr  Mnuchin wrote A Treasury spokesman  Tony Sayegh  tweeted a statement saying that the ethics issue was the result of a technical difference between federal ethics officials and Treasury s ethics staff  We are pleased that OGE has approved an updated ethics agreement recognizing that he may hold an interest in that asset   Mr  Sayegh said It is extremely rare for cabinet officials to not have their financial records certified  said Virginia Canter  a former senior ethics counsel at the Treasury Department  In 2001  Paul H  O Neill  President George W  Bush s Treasury secretary  divested his holdings in Alcoa  an aluminum producer  because of conflicts of interest Ms  Canter said she was surprised that Mr  Mnuchin was blaming Treasury s ethics officials for the lapse  arguing that it was ultimately his responsibility to meet the government s requirements  What s he doing being involved in intellectual property matters that could affect the entertainment industry in the negotiations with China   Ms  Canter said   It raises an appearance issue  The explanation from Mr  Mnuchin did not satisfy some Democrats on Thursday Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the top Democrat on the Finance Committee  said that he remained baffled by how the Treasury and the ethics office handled the matter and that he planned to review Mr  Mnuchin s modified ethics agreement  Before being confirmed by the Senate  he signed an ethics agreement that said he would divest from StormChaser Partners L L C    Mr  Wyden said   Rather than divest  he violated the spirit of his ethics agreement by selling his interest to his then fiance and then he violated the letter of the agreement when he reacquired the assets upon their marriage   

  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in position to win a fourth consecutive term on Wednesday  with nearly all of the votes counted  By Wednesday evening  the rival Blue and White alliance led by Benny Gantz had conceded the race  though ballots were still being counted   After the final tally  it will be up to President Reuven Rivlin to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority  But Mr  Netanyahu s Likud bloc had a strong numerical advantage in being able to form a governing coalition   Regardless of the final result  the election illustrated the deep divisions under Mr  Netanyahu  69  who has led Israel for a decade of relative security and prosperity  More than a million Israelis voted for Blue and White  a record for a new party  placing it in the position of being the main alternative to Israel s right wing  a spot held for decades by the Labor Party  See Mr  Netanyahu s road through Israeli history in photos

control of the government  We didn t win on this round   Yair Lapid  one of the alliance leaders  said Mr  Gantz  who had once been seen as a viable contender for prime minister  speaking to a crowd in Tel Aviv a short time earlier  said he would respect the decision of the president to choose the party leader he saw fit but vowed to fight on  in any way I can   At the moment  with the blocs

of the people  of the president  We will serve them from any position that we will be in the future  Mr  Gantz  a retired lieutenant general and former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces  had reached out for allies across the political spectrum and sought to make Mr  Netanyahu s expected indictment on corruption charges the main issue in the race The ballots are still being counted   a final tally is not expected until tomorrow   and after that  President Rivlin will choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority to head the government

cameras at polls and boasts of low turnoutA public relations firm has claimed credit for placing cameras in Arab polling stations in support of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  boasting that the effort helped lower voter turnout  according to posts on the company s Facebook page The company  Kaizler Inbar  in a public Facebook post wrote   Thanks to us placing observers in every polling station we managed to lower the voter turnout to under 50 percent  the lowest in recent years   according to a translation in the Israeli news outlet Haaretz The company said it worked with Likud to distribute the cameras  The company is headed by Sagi Kaizler  a former leader of a West Bank settler group  who confirmed to Haaretz that his company was behind the Likud funded effort A photo of staff members standing alongside Mr  Netanyahu and his wife  Sara  was posted with the note On Election Day  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling stations in predominantly Arab towns  Some of the cameras were concealed  as seen in videos online  Likud said the cameras were deployed to record evidence of potential voter fraud The Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint on Tuesday over the cameras  calling the tactic voter intimidation  The police confiscated dozens of the cameras  and the Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said filming in polling stations was prohibited   MEGAN SPECIAImageAn event in Jerusalem this month for Shas  an ultra Orthodox party  Shas has pledged to support Benjamin Netanyahu in a governing coalition CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesParties on the right line up behind NetanyahuFour right wing and religious parties had publicly pledged by Wednesday morning to support Mr  Netanyahu in his bid to form Israel s next governing coalition  Those commitments  if they hold  leave him just one seat short of a parliamentary majority and a fourth consecutive term in office The four parties   Kulanu  the Union of Right Wing Parties  and the ultra Orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism   are projected to win a combined 25 seats  Together with the 35 seats that Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party is projected to win  such a coalition would have 60 seats in the 120 seat Parliament Also among what Mr  Netanyahu terms his  natural partners  is the hard line Yisrael Beiteinu party  led by Avigdor Lieberman  which is projected to take five seats The party has joined coalition governments led by Mr  Netanyahu in the past  but Mr  Lieberman was holding out on Wednesday  saying he was waiting for the final tally of votes  including the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients that are to be counted later this week Mr  Lieberman served as foreign affairs minister and then defense minister under Mr  Netanyahu  but resigned from the government in November  complaining of a soft policy toward Hamas  the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza A

next steps depend on Israel s president  a Netanyahu foePresident Reuven Rivlin will decide whether to invite Mr  Netanyahu to form a governing coalition  though the two men have made little secret over the years of their mutual loathing  The president s office said Wednesday that he would begin consulting party heads next week to gauge their choices for prime minister In what the office described as a  historic and pioneering decision   it plans to broadcast those meetings live  in the name of transparency   That move may offer Mr  Rivlin protection from possible barbs from Mr  Netanyahu if the process does not go as the prime minister would like  Here is a guide to The New York Times s coverage of the Israeli election  The origins of the animosity between the president and prime minister are unclear  but it burst into the open when Mr  Rivlin  a veteran of Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party and a former speaker of Parliament  was running for the presidency in 2014 So determined was Mr  Netanyahu to thwart Mr  Rivlin s candidacy that he tried to recruit Elie Wiesel  a Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate  for the job   even though Mr  Wiesel  who has since died  was not an Israeli citizen at the time  When that failed  Mr  Netanyahu floated the idea of abolishing the largely ceremonial office Mr  Rivlin  79  has spoken out forcefully against the government s attempts to curb the independence of the courts and the media  and what he called a lack of  statesmanship  under Mr  Netanyahu    ISABEL KERSHNERImageThe settlement of Beitar Illit  Making an appeal

where I will continue to fight for them  In November  Mr  Bennett sought to be named defense minister  but the prime minister turned him down The New Right broke away from a more established right wing party  aiming to free itself of the influence of ultra Orthodox rabbis and more extremist elements in the pro settler community  But it defined itself by what it was not  rather than what it was  and its election ads were widely seen as sophomoric  They were rising stars with a solid base of support  which they abandoned   said Tal Shalev  a political reporter for Walla  a news site Mr  Bennett and Ms  Shaked had expected to compete with Mr  Gantz for support from the center right  Instead  those voters appeared to turn to other parties on the right  believing Mr  Netanyahu s dire warnings that a Gantz victory would mean a return to left wing government Ms  Shaked  the justice minister  is highly popular among Likud activists  many of whom see her as a future prime minister

outside the White House   Everyone said you can t have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians  I think we have a chance  and I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won  Mr  Trump has reversed generations of United States policy  moving the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv  and recognizing Israel s authority over the Golan Heights  which much of the world has condemned Those moves  urged by the Israeli leader  bolstered Mr  Netanyahu s political standing at home  particularly on the right  Days before the election  he said he would annex parts of the occupied West Bank   another goal of the Israeli right  despite international and Palestinian objections that such a move could doom the prospects for a peace agreement Mr  Trump has promised to

We ve ended this live briefing for the night  We will have another one on Wednesday  Here s what happened today   Exit polls show a dead heat in the race between Benjamin Netanyahu  the polarizing

until early morning Israel time  late tonight in the U S  It will then be up to President Reuven Rivlin to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority   Regardless of who becomes the next prime minister  the election has already proven to be a humbling setback for Mr  Netanyahu  69  who has built a strong economy  kept the country safe and

preliminary exit polls The muddled projected outcome left Israel teetering at a critical juncture between an ever sharper turn to the right or a more moderate reset of the political order The exit polls of the three main television channels were sufficiently disparate that both sides claimed victory In a head to head matchup  two of the polls showed Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party ahead and a third showed him in a draw with Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  But including the broader blocs supporting each party  two polls showed the Likud bloc ahead and the third was a draw Just after midnight  Mr  Gantz made a triumphant entrance at his party headquarters to the cheers and chants of supporters  and gave a victory speech even though victory was not assured Calling it  a historic day   Mr

parties is able to win seats in the Parliament when all the votes are counted  those extra seats could swing the determination of the winning coalition and thus the next prime minister When will we

counting was expected to continue until at least 3 a m  Israel time  8 p m  Eastern   and possibly hours later  By Wednesday morning  the Central Elections Committee should release close to final

already busy on Tuesday night trying to secure recommendations and support from his so called  natural partners  among the right wing and religious parties A caveat on exit pollsThe final outcome was likely to be swayed by several small parties that were teetering just above or below the electoral threshold  according to the exit polls  Avigdor Lieberman  the leader of one such party  the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu  said it was  too early to draw conclusions  The exit polls of the 2015 election serve as a cautionary tale  They anticipated a tie between Likud and the center left Zionist Union  with most projecting 27 seats for each  In the final count  Likud prevailed with 30 seats and the Zionist Union won only 24 In another variable on Tuesday  the exit polls may not have

the polls before it was too late But among Arab voters  where a boycott movement appeared to be having a strong effect  the haranguing was especially intense  The right is planning to crush the Arab

have voted to preserve the status quo  they have said  no  to peace and  yes  to the occupation  Just days ago  Mr  Netanyahu unexpectedly promised to begin extending Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank if re elected  The move would probably doom a two state solution and appeared to be a last ditch effort to rally his right wing base Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party has come out against the idea of annexing West Bank settlements  but it has been vague about allowing a Palestinian state alongside Israel Netanyahu s party places hidden cameras at Arab pollsA boycott campaign wasn t the only reason for poor turnout among Arab voters  Early Tuesday  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling places in Arab towns At least some of the Likud observers concealed the cameras  as online videos showed  Likud said the move was aimed at capturing evidence of any irregularities According to Israeli news reports  the Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint  calling it voter intimidation  the police confiscated dozens of the cameras  and the Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said filming in polling stations was prohibited Just before 9 p m   the left wing party Meretz  which was counting on Arab support to clear the threshold to be seated in Parliament  appealed to elections officials to keep the polls open in Arab villages an extra hour to allow in any voters who had initially been scared off by the cameras How it worksVoters cast ballots for parties  not candidates  Thirty nine parties are participating  The percentage of the vote determines a party s number of seats in the Knesset  or Parliament  Any party needs at least 3 25 percent of the vote for a seat Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and Mr  Gantz s Blue and White alliance are expected to gain more seats than any other group  But each will fall far short of achieving a 61 seat majority on its own  meaning that a new government will almost certainly be formed by a multiparty coalition  See our guide to the Israeli elections  Possible outcomesImageA poster of the Blue and White party leaders in Tel Aviv  depicting from left

smaller right wing parties Blue and White wins the most seats  Mr  Gantz and his partners might be able to reach a majority with a combination of smaller parties on the left and right Unity government of Likud plus Blue and White  While Mr  Gantz has vowed never to serve in a government led by Mr  Netanyahu  there has been speculation that their parties might negotiate to form a unity government if neither can attain the sufficient number of seats  Such a possibility would increase if some smaller parties needed by Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz fail to make the 3 25 percent threshold Any party that wins at least 3 25 percent of the vote gets at least three seats in Parliament  but if parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes are discarded

HONG KONG   Nine democracy activists on Tuesday were convicted by a Hong Kong court on public nuisance charges for their roles in the protest movement that led to the monthslong occupation of major intersections in the city five years ago The activists face prison terms of up to seven years The protests  which became known as the Umbrella Movement  galvanized the city and sought to force Hong Kong s top official to step down and the government to accept more democratic means to elect future leaders While the protests had no formal leaders  three of the people on trial   Chu Yiu ming  a retired pastor  and two professors  Benny Tai and Chan Kin man   were founders of Occupy Central With Love and Peace  one of the main groups advocating civil disobedience to demand changes to Hong Kong s electoral system The three were convicted of conspiracy to commit public nuisance  Mr  Tai and Mr  Chan were also convicted of incitement to commit public nuisance The convictions were swiftly criticized by Hong Kong democracy advocates  human rights groups and politicians in the United States and Britain  At a time when most people would have thought that the aim of the Hong Kong government should be to bring the whole community together  it seems appallingly divisive to use anachronistic common law charges in a vengeful pursuit of political events which took place in 2014   Chris Patten  the last colonial governor of Hong Kong  said in a statement Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  and Representative James P  McGovern  Democrat of Massachusetts  said in a statement that the convictions  effectively punish peaceful political dissent and narrow the space for free expression and peaceful assembly  The Occupy Central founders had envisioned a sit in of two or three days  but student protesters who occupied a square near the Hong Kong government headquarters pre empted their plans  When the police used pepper spray and later tear gas against the student protesters  thousands of people took to the streets The Umbrella Movement  which took its name from the shield protesters used against pepper spray  lasted 79 days  with participants camping out behind homemade barriers on the streets of some of the city s busiest districts ImageDemonstrators near the Hong Kong government headquarters in September 2014  When the police used pepper spray and tear gas against student protesters  thousands of people took to the streets CreditDale De La Rey Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe activists on trial argued that they were being disproportionately blamed for acts of civil disobedience meant to help the people of the city  This is a case about some Hong Kong people who love Hong Kong very much and believe that only through the introduction of genuine universal suffrage could a door be opened to resolving the deep seated conflicts in Hong Kong   Mr  Tai said in a closing submission during the trial last year Judge Johnny Chan of the District Court rejected the argument of the Occupy Central leaders that the protest was an appropriate exercise of free speech  finding that they knew  the occupy movement would impinge unreasonably upon the rights of others  The protests have been followed by a long stretch of frustration and defeat for pro democracy activists Hong Kong s leader at the time  Leung Chun ying  refused to step down  though he did not seek another term in 2017  Lawmakers rejected a proposal that would have allowed Hong Kong voters to directly elect their leader  known as the chief executive  but only from a slate of candidates approved by a pro establishment election committee Some young activists took to politics after the defeat of the Umbrella Movement but found themselves blocked from holding office In 2016 and 2017  Hong Kong courts removed six lawmakers for altering their oaths of office to include phrases of protest that echoed the calls of the Umbrella Movement  Several others have been disqualified from running in recent elections by officials who have ruled that they do not sincerely believe that Hong Kong is an  inalienable part  of China Hong Kong  a former British colony  returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a  one country  two systems  arrangement that allows it to maintain its own local government and legal system  with far more robust protection of civil liberties than in mainland China  The Basic Law  Hong Kong s local constitution  envisions a directly elected chief executive  but the central government has maintained that the candidates must pass a strict nomination procedure  which helped set off the 2014 protests In addition to the three Occupy Central founders  Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka chun  both current lawmakers  Lee Wing tat  a former lawmaker  Tommy Cheung and Eason Chung  who were student leaders  and Raphael Wong  a member of the League of Social Democrats  a pro democracy party  were convicted of public nuisance charges The government has prosecuted 266 people over the Umbrella Movement  with 118 convicted  according to a tally last year by Kong Tsung gan  a Hong Kong writer and activist Last year  Hong Kong s highest court overturned prison sentences of six to eight months given to three student leaders  Joshua Wong  Alex Chow and Nathan Law  But the court also affirmed tougher sentencing guidelines for future offenses that  cross the line of acceptability  including acts of incitement  particularly so if violence is involved   

The number of executions around the world fell by about a third in 2018  reaching the lowest level in at least a decade as several countries scaled back or abolished the death penalty  Amnesty International said in a report released on Wednesday The global decline was driven largely by Iran  where executions were halved because of legal reforms that included eliminating the death penalty for a number of drug related crimes  The trend points toward a world ridding itself of the death penalty   said Oluwatosin Popoola  Amnesty International s adviser on the death penalty Over all  at least 690 people were executed last year  compared with 993 the year before  the organization said  Despite the reforms  Iran still executed more than 250 people last year  second only to China  Iran was followed by Saudi Arabia  Vietnam and Iraq in executions ImageCritically  though  the report s headline figure omits the thousands of estimated annual executions carried out by China  which Amnesty International calls  the world s top executioner   The group stopped providing estimates for China a decade ago  after the government there began misrepresenting the numbers  which are only minimum estimates ImageDemonstrators in Rome last year called for the abolition of the death penalty CreditAP Photo Andrew MedichiniThe country by country figures  published annually by Amnesty International since 2008  are based on what the group can reasonably confirm through official and informal sources  Some countries  such as China  consider death sentences to be a state secret  while little information can be gathered on others that are too restrictive or marred by conflict  such as North Korea or Syria While even repressive governments like Iran s have taken steps to reduce death sentences  executions still rose  albeit in small numbers  in Belarus  Japan  Singapore  South Sudan and the United States In the United States  25 people were executed last year  slightly up from the year before  Executions in the country peaked in 1999  when 98 people were put to death  according to the Death Penalty Information Center In Sri Lanka  President Maithripala Sirisena announced plans to resurrect the death penalty after a 40 year moratorium  while Thailand carried out its first execution in a decade Amnesty International also expressed concern about an increase in death sentences in some countries  In Iraq  for example  the number of people sentenced to death last year quadrupled to 271  In Egypt  717 were sentenced to death last year  compared with 402 the year before Still  the group found that the death penalty is generally on the decline  with a growing number of countries limiting its use or banning it outright  as Gambia and Malaysia announced last year  By the end of last year  142 countries had abolished the death penalty by law or in practice  

JERUSALEM   His army nickname was Benny Huta  a Hebrew pun that translates as  Benny Chill   And in his first ever run for office  Benny Gantz never let anyone see him sweat  no matter the live television gaffes  embarrassing leaks or rumors about personal improprieties that occasionally tripped up his candidacy for prime minister His centrist  flag hued Blue and White party did better than any new Israeli faction ever had before  earning more than a million votes and around 35 seats in Parliament on Tuesday  That was the same as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud party did  though smaller right wing factions tilted the election sharply to the incumbent It was quite a showing after just a few months in politics  Now  Mr  Gantz  a three star general and former Israeli military chief  is laying in for a siege against Mr  Netanyahu that his allies expect could last into 2020  Nothing will drive us from our goal   Mr  Gantz said Wednesday night With Mr  Netanyahu expected to form the most right wing and ultra Orthodox government Israel has ever seen  it will probably be a bumpy road even before a coalition is formed The issue of military conscription is likely to put secular and ultra Orthodox parties in his coalition immediately at odds  Mr  Netanyahu s expected indictment is looming  and may come as soon as July  And then there is the wild card of a Trump administration peace plan   one that some of his coalition partners could well find unacceptable   that could be announced at any time ImageA Blue and White campaign poster in Tel Aviv  From left  Moshe Yaalon  Mr  Gantz  Yair Lapid and Gabi Ashkenazi CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesOn Wednesday  Mr  Gantz s partner in Blue and White  Yair Lapid  offered a warning to Mr  Netanyahu and the Likud   We are going to make your lives miserable   We will turn the Knesset into a field of battle   he said   And we will do one more thing  We will show the citizens of Israel how a real  true alternative looks  Yet as a candidate  Mr  Gantz  with his hooded eyes  mild manner and above all his willingness to let Mr  Lapid take over as prime minister after two years of their term  left many voters wondering if he had the fire in the belly   or as Israelis call it  the  knife in the teeth    to defeat Mr  Netanyahu And on Wednesday  he spoke less militantly than Mr  Lapid of his plans as opposition leader  I have come not for power  I came for a goal   he said   I came for Israeli society  I came from a place of great love for Israeli society and a place of great love for the country  For Mr  Gantz  merely holding his seven week old party together would be its own achievement  Blue and White comprises left  centrist and right wing politicians who were able to get behind a noncontroversial platform  but have not yet had occasion to fight over actual legislation It is a merger of three parties  Mr  Gantz s Israel Resilience  itself a fledgling party  a small  more hawkish faction led by Moshe Yaalon  a former defense minister and army chief who is a veteran of Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party  and Yesh Atid  an established centrist party led by Mr  Lapid  a former finance minister  A third army chief  Gabi Ashkenazi  also occupies a top leadership spot ImageMr  Gantz and his wife  Revital  casting their votes in Rosh Haayin  Israel  on Tuesday CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesAll four put their egos aside for the campaign   though that was with an outcome in mind that did not involve sitting in the opposition Blue and White will also have to resist what are certain to be the wily Mr  Netanyahu s efforts to divide and conquer  and there are several visible seams Mr  Netanyahu could test  The prime minister could woo the half dozen right wing members with legislation they want  straining the discipline of their new party  He could also offer the defense ministry to Mr  Gantz or either of the other retired generals Mr  Lapid  who built Yesh Atid into a national organization in pursuit of his own ambition to become prime minister  may see himself as a more capable leader of the opposition in Parliament than Mr  Gantz  And other party members with important jobs like Avi Nissenkorn  the chairman of the labor federation Histadrut   Israel s A F L  C I O    may grow impatient as lawmakers in the minority Mr  Lapid  the most seasoned spokesman of the bunch  tackled those doubts head on   I see an ensemble   he said   They will try to break us up  They will not succeed  Analysts have speculated that a Trump peace plan might prompt Mr  Netanyahu to appeal to Mr  Gantz to form a broad national unity government  But Yoaz Hendel  a former Netanyahu spokesman who was No  2 in Mr  Yaalon s Telem Party  said Mr  Gantz would have little trouble resisting such advances  I don t see any reason to help Netanyahu with a Trump plan   Mr  Hendel said   If he has his own coalition  I offer him to do it by himself  I don t see any reason to give him a defense shield  ImageBlue and White supporters on Election Day CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesMr  Gantz ran on a slate dedicated to integrity  clean government and repairing the system  The party offered voters something less than a revolution  But the mild tones of its campaign appealed to a widespread yearning among many Israelis to return to an older  possibly idealized Israel  where leaders were modest to the point of frugality and put the good of the country before party or personal interests Mr  Gantz spoke of being a prime minister for all Israeli citizens  Jews and non Jews alike  itself a noteworthy statement in the current environment  But he ruled out forming a coalition with the leaders of Arab parties  And to appeal to as many voters as possible  he espoused no firm policy positions and said little about fundamental issues like the Israeli Palestinian conflict Born to parents who survived the Holocaust  became Zionist pioneers and helped found a farming community in the early years of the state  Mr  Gantz speaks English with a thick Israeli accent and is understated to the point of appearing bashful He lives unostentatiously in Rosh Haayin  in central Israel  in a suburban neighborhood of neat  semidetached homes built for army officers  His hobbies include attending communal singalongs of Hebrew oldies like  Hareut   his favorite  a haunting rendition of a poem by Haim Gouri  who died last year  The song memorializes the comradeship of those who fought in the 1948 war surrounding Israel s creation Mr  Gantz grew up in a religious family in Kfar Ahim  a cooperative agricultural village near the border with Gaza  His father  Nahum  was from Romania  His mother  Malka  who was Hungarian  was liberated from the Bergen Belsen concentration camp In an emotional address at the launch of the Blue and White alliance in February  Mr  Gantz related that 75 years ago  Mr  Lapid s father  Tommy  and Mr  Gantz s mother shared a room together in the Jewish ghetto in Budapest ImageMr  Gantz  right  and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  second from left  in 2011 CreditGali Tibbon Agence France Presse   Getty Images And now we stand here before you  the son of Tommy  of blessed memory  and the son of Malka  of blessed memory  sharing one stage   he said   Because the state of Israel is a miracle  Mr  Gantz s parents were friends with Shimon Peres  who served as Israel s prime minister and later as president  said Ayelet Frish  a strategic consultant who worked for Mr  Peres  who died in 2016  He s as straight as an arrow   she said of Mr  Gantz   He is not quick to take decisions  but he knows how to take them  In his long career  Mr  Gantz spent two years as Israel s military attach in Washington  and once rode across the United States on a Harley Davidson  He retired from the Israel Defense Forces in 2015 Fania Oz Salzberger  the daughter of Amos Oz  the Israeli writer and peace advocate who died last year  said her father and Mr  Gantz  were respectful friends  though Gantz is politically right of Oz   Gantz often visited my ill father   she said on Twitter   They talked a lot  And father told us   A good leader must understand human nature  read the map  have courage and compassion  That s Gantz    

Israel stood still for a moment this week so it could bring home the remains of Sgt  Zachary Baumel  a soldier who perished in battle in 1982  This was in the midst of the most bitterly contested election the country has had in decades  with important things at stake  the probity of government  relations with the Diaspora  the limits of the settlement enterprise  the possibility of peace There are things that matter more  Keeping faith with the fallen and bereaved is one of them Anyone who has lived in Israel gets this  It s a young and improvising state resting atop an ancient and profound civilization  At the heart of the civilization is common memory  Elections come and go  memory accretes  It is to everyday life what geology is to flora and fauna  grounding  shaping  slow moving  still growing  Memory is the true land of Israel The Israeli government spent 37 years tracking Baumel s remains to Syria and negotiating their recovery through Russia  The country will expend similar efforts to bring home other fallen soldiers held in enemy hands  It s the core of the Jewish state s social contract  It may not be able to keep its people safe  much less make them rich  But it will never forget or forsake them That s something to consider when it comes to the election  too  In Washington last month I interviewed Benny Gantz  the former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces who now leads the Blue and White party  the principal challenger to Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud Gantz doesn t communicate a political agenda so much as he does a character and an attitude  He s an Israeli of the old school  confident  to the point  unassuming   a man who tries  but doesn t quite succeed  in hiding his warmth  In our interview he described himself as a security hawk and a  moderate capitalist   but otherwise his ideology is mainly about not having one The interview itself was unremarkable  Gantz had a slight lead in the polls at the time  he s now in a dead heat  though the outcome of the election will depend on how smaller  coalition making parties fare   and he seemed to be taking care to say nothing that would get him into trouble  Here  condensed for clarity  is what stood out ImageIsraeli soldiers carring the coffin of Sergeant Zachary Baumel during a military funeral at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem CreditAbir Sultan EPA  via ShutterstockOn Netanyahu   Very smart  a good manager  a good politician  He s what so many Israelis would like to see  in a prime minister   In the last four or five years  something happened to this guy  I don t know what happened  It s unexplainable  On Palestinian statehood   Israel needs to stay a Zionist country with a Jewish majority in a democratic system  Eventually  Palestinians should have some kind of independency  On egalitarian prayer spaces   The Western Wall is long enough to accommodate everyone  On Israel s security needs vis  vis Palestinians   We should maintain security for a perimeter outside  Palestinian areas   Conduct security inside  If we don t  it will endanger Palestinians themselves  The economies should eventually be merged  On relations with the U S    We share the same values and moral standards and we share the same interests  And it stands for both sides of the aisle  On whether he would serve in a coalition with Netanyahu  either over or under him   No  On what distinguishes his party from Netanyahu s   We have left and right  religious and secular  Druse  ultra Orthodox women  Unity is very important  We cannot agree on everything but we must agree on the framework    Netanyahu currently lives off this separation  between various Israeli groups   I m talking about my priorities  but I m talking to everyone  He s appealing to his base  That last observation is the essential point  In many ways  Israel has defied expectations and done remarkably well over the past decade  Much of this has been Netanyahu s doing But it has come at the cost of increasing divisions between Israeli and American Jews  And intense divisions between Orthodox and non Orthodox Jews  And embittering divisions between Jewish and non Jewish Israelis  And between the hard right and everyone it deems a sellout   an ever growing group when one practices the politics of loyalists versus traitors  as opposed to the politics of friends and potential friends None of these quarrels are about Israel s enemies  who are real  deadly and growing in number  But the quarrels have become enemies in themselves  Israel is powerful enough to defeat any of its regional adversaries  in almost any combination  It can survive the challenge of the Palestinians and binationalism  too  Whether it can survive its own descent into sectarian and ideological tribalism is another matter Which is why the return of Baumel s remains seems so propitiously timed  Israeli pundits think it will help Netanyahu s re election chances  on the view that it makes him seem more capable and statesmanlike I wouldn t be so sure  Baumel s short life  tragic death and hard fought homecoming are potent reminders of all the ties that still unite the Jewish state  for all the differences  They are what commends Gantz s candidacy  whether he wins this time or not The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think

WASHINGTON   Temporary status is a seemingly permanent condition of the Trump administration The resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen as homeland security secretary on Sunday means that another cabinet officer who reports directly to President Trump will have the word  acting  next to the official title at a major department of government Interim secretaries are also in place at the Departments of Defense and of the Interior  and at the Office of Management and Budget  the Small Business Administration and ambassador s office at the United Nations  Mick Mulvaney  Mr  Trump s chief of staff  is also serving in an acting capacity  I like acting  It gives me more flexibility  Do you understand that   Mr  Trump told reporters in January before departing to Camp David   I like acting  So we have a few that are acting  We have a great  great cabinet  But there are concerns about having men and women in such high level jobs without having been subjected to Senate confirmation for those posts  Leaving cabinet secretaries unconfirmed in their roles could give the president even more leverage over them  or could leave them without full authority in the job  The Senate grappled with this question in the very first Congress when it ordered George Washington to send nominations to the Hill at a reasonable pace   said Paul Light  a professor of public service at New York University who has written extensively on the appointment process   Senators rightly worried that presidents might use acting appointees to evade oversight and institutional prerogatives  Yet  we haven t heard a word from the Senate on the Trump administration s abuse of its acting authority  Justice Clarence Thomas argued in a concurring opinion in a 2017 case that there was seemingly no constitutional basis for having  acting  cabinet members and that there needed to be limits on a president s power to fill the highest positions without Senate confirmation The Constitution requires that the president obtain  the advice and consent of the Senate  before appointing cabinet officials  Legal scholars also questioned the president s power to use the  acting  authority in replacing Ms  Nielsen  To me  the real difference is avoiding Senate confirmation   either because the individuals he wants running these agencies can t be confirmed even by a Republican controlled Senate  or because he s worried about the kinds of questions they d have to answer and or concessions they d have to make in order to be confirmed   said Stephen Vladeck  a law professor at the University of Texas   Either way  that s an alarming argument for bypassing a Senate controlled by his own party  Mr  Trump announced in a tweet on Sunday that Kevin McAleenan  47  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  will be Ms  Nielsen s replacement  as  acting  homeland security secretary at a time when the president has said there is a security crisis at the border with Mexico because of a flood of migrants trying to gain entry into the United States The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other Some acting officials like Patrick M  Shanahan  the acting defense secretary who had been deputy defense secretary  have been confirmed by the Senate but not in the post in which they serve  David Bernhardt  the acting interior secretary  had already been confirmed as the department s deputy and is undergoing confirmation by the Senate for the top job Mr  Trump had long publicly said he was satisfied with the performance of Ms  Nielsen  He expressed similar optimism for her acting successor  I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job   Mr  Trump said in his tweet No matter whom Mr  Trump selected  it would take time to get fully operational  Government agencies  Mr  Light noted  must  wade through piles of internal paperwork assigning responsibilities and signature authorities to one acting after another  Career government officials  wonder when vacancies will be filled  how long the actings will stay and whether they ve got the right name on the organization chart to move forward on major issues such as the Max 8 groundings   he said  referring to the airliner involved in two fatal crashes Oversight by ethics and accountability agencies within the government is also constrained   The result is a fundamental collapse in ordinary accountability   Mr  Light said In her resignation letter  Ms  Nielsen said she hoped the incoming secretary would  have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse  But the support of Congress may be difficult to obtain  notably among Democrats  who have said Mr  Trump is usurping the role of a coequal branch of government  Without confirmation hearings  there s less of a chance for the Senate to meaningfully play a role in identifying who will be in charge of these critical government functions  and thus less accountability for episodes like Acting Secretary Shanahan s ties to Boeing   Mr  Vladeck said   Second  an acting secretary may have the same control over his or her own agency as someone who is Senate confirmed  but traditionally  Senate confirmed officers have more pull in any interagency conflict  and so it has the effect of skewing the authority of different agencies toward those with permanent heads  What is more  Mr  Trump has relentlessly said there is a  crisis  on the border  yet the two cabinet departments most directly responsible for dealing with the situation  Homeland Security and Defense  do not have permanent leaders  It s striking how many of the secretaries of the largest departments of this government are acting at this point   Senator Chris Coons  Democrat of Delaware  said Monday on CNN  

ImageIt has been more than a year since logging was ordered stopped in the Bialowieza Forest  but the scars are  still visible CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York TimesBIALOWIEZA  Poland   The forest floor is a graveyard  strewn with fallen spruce and oak trees  But beneath the broken limbs and rotting leaves  thousands of species of insects are feeding in Bialowieza Forest  Fungi of many types are found only here  and sprout all year round  More are discovered every year  More than 200 species of birds  including rare woodpeckers and owls  fill the air with song  There is more life in

MantovaniImageEnvironmental activists checking lichens on trees CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York TimesIt has been more than a year since the European Court of Justice ordered an end to logging in the forest  finding that it posed a clear threat to the United Nations World Heritage site  The scars  though  are still visible   from the tracks gouged into the earth by the heavy machinery used to cut down thousands of ancient trees to the gaping holes in the canopy created by their removal The ruling was a major defeat for Poland s governing Law and Justice party  which supported the logging  Warsaw initially defied the court order  but relented when faced with a fine of 100 000 euros  about  124 000  for each day it violated the directive The battle over Bialowieza is just one of many being waged by the right wing government against the European Union  which has accused Poland of posing a risk to democratic values and the rule of law by trying to pack its courts and restrict press freedoms  Now there are fears that the Polish government is once again drawing up plans to increase logging in the area  skirting the ruling by increasing the quota for wood in hundreds of

the German occupation of Poland  Hermann Goering was so enamored of the forest that he drew up plans to create the world s largest hunting grounds and establish a Nazi Jurassic Park of sorts  reintroducing prehistoric animals to the landscape As the playground of the rich and powerful  Bialowieza was spared the fate of so many of the Continent s other forests  most of which were razed and some of which were turned into intensively controlled versions of nature  The order imposed on some of these European forests is remarkable  especially to anyone used to the untamed national parks in the United States and Canada  Armies of forest rangers relentlessly clear dead wood and underbrush to create near perfect carpets beneath the pines  The woods can feel more like nurseries than wild spaces  We have forgotten what nature looks like   Professor Kowalczyk said But Bialowieza has remained wild and unruly  Its remoteness and mostly pristine condition helped make it the site of one of the Continent s great conservation victories   the reintroduction of bison after the last free roaming animal was hunted and killed in 1919  The forest is now home to Europe s largest herd of bison  or wisent  Most people  when they think about forests  think about managed nature   said Professor Kowalczyk  who first came to Bialowieza in the 1980s   This place is so different than any forest I had ever seen  ImageStudents during a presentation on environmental awareness at the forest in 2017 CreditAndrea MantovaniImageThe trial of Lukasz Lyskawka  left  an activist convicted of assaulting forest guards CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York Times While the bison was a big success story  a much smaller creature  the hairy little bark beetle  set off the logging fight Spruce trees  especially when in a weakened state  make a perfect mating ground for the beetles  The male bores into the tree  creating a chamber where he will release pheromones to attract females  He will mate with several of them  who in turn will deposit dozens of eggs in the chamber before flying off to find new mates  The larvae left behind will feed on the vascular tissue of the tree  By the time they pupate  the damage they have done often has sucked the life from the spruce The tracks from the beetles  known as printers  can still be spotted in felled trees all across the forest Warmer winters  brought on by climate change  have allowed the population to explode  And the preference of forest managers for spruce trees has expanded the territory where they can thrive By 2016  it was clear that the beetle infestation in Bialowieza was devastating large tracts of trees  including stands hundreds of years old ImageSlawomir Dron  in the orange vest  manages a cafe at the entrance to the forest

raise her children CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York Times For many scientists  the best way to manage the infestation was to leave it alone  letting nature take its course  The bark beetle has been a part of the ecosystem for hundreds of years   said Adam Bohdan  a biologist from the Wild Poland Foundation   This phenomenon is a natural adaptation to the new climate situation  But the Polish government did not agree  It argued that the lack of human intervention in the forest would doom it  So Jan Szyszko  the environment minister at the time  ordered a large scale logging campaign  allowing heavy machinery to roll into pristine stands of trees  We will rebuild the valuable habitats in the Bialowieza Forest by removing dead trees as much as is necessary  and restoring the oaks and ashes   Mr  Szyszko declared in 2016 The move was greeted with outrage  with protesters descending on the forest  setting up an encampment and forming human blockades to try and stop the heavy machinery An army of more than 1 000 forest rangers from around the country was dispatched to a small village on the border of Belarus ready to confront the activists ImageOne of the last wood factories in the forest CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York TimesImageThe hotel Zubrowka in Bialowieza is frequented by a cosmopolitan clientele CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York TimesAt times  tempers boiled over into violence  Skirmishes broke out as activists engaged in coordinated acts of civil disobedience  But it was not until the European court threatened financial penalties that the logging ended A report issued by Unesco in February found that the  logging operations and other forest management activities have disrupted the ecological and natural processes in the property  But it was not beyond repair  according to the report  And the forest is much quieter now  New life is replacing the old although beetles remain a problem with no easy solution  In the natural forest  there is two times more dead wood than in the managed part of the forest   said Mr  Bohdan  who took part in the protests a year ago   It is really a unique laboratory   But all the time   he said   there is a worry that they will start logging again   Joanna Berendt contributed reporting ImageThe Hajnowka Cemetery at the gate of the forest CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  For years  Todd R  Howe reaped the rewards of being a Cuomo family loyalist He had worked for Gov  Mario M  Cuomo in the 1980s  and then for his son  Andrew  in the 1990s  He traded on his reputation as an Albany insider and earned up to  750 000 a year as a lobbyist and consultant  He vacationed in St  Lucia and drove a Porsche Then came a precipitous fall that took him from influencing the powerful in Albany to working as a groundskeeper in Idaho  In 2016  Mr  Howe pleaded guilty to eight felonies and agreed to testify for the prosecution in a sprawling public corruption case that has loomed over Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo s administration for more than two years Seven people were eventually convicted or pleaded guilty in cases that hinged on testimony from Mr  Howe  For that  he was rewarded on Friday with a sentence that included no prison time The fallout from the case has relentlessly shadowed Mr  Cuomo  Though prosecutors never accused the governor of any wrongdoing  and he has distanced himself from Mr  Howe  political opponents have repeatedly asked what Mr  Cuomo knew  During Mr  Cuomo s re election campaign last year  his rivals outright accused him of complicity One of Mr  Cuomo s former top lieutenants is now in prison  a conviction that Mr  Cuomo called  personally painful   A former economic development adviser was convicted  too  and one of the governor s signature upstate projects was tainted The governor coasted to re election last year  winning commanding victories in both the primary and general election  But the trials made clear he had come up short on one of his earliest campaign promises   to clean up Albany and restore public trust in government On Friday  the series of corruption cases seemed to have found an ending  at least legally  when Mr  Howe appeared in federal court in Manhattan  He was the last of the eight people felled by the corruption scandal to be sentenced While the governor s aide  Joseph Percoco  received six years in prison after being convicted on three charges  the judge  Valerie E  Caproni  sentenced Mr  Howe to five years of probation The light sentence recognized Mr  Howe s turn as the star witness in the case   He had faced up to 14 years in prison for his eight felonies   Testifying during Mr  Percoco s trial  Mr  Howe had offered an intimate  unvarnished and damning view of the highest levels of state government He described setting up a fund raising breakfast for Mr  Cuomo with developers who wanted state business  arranging a paid fishing trip between developers and Mr  Percoco  and ultimately facilitating more than  300 000 in bribes to Mr  Percoco for his help in securing state deals Judge Caproni said before imposing her sentence that Mr  Howe s actions had fed the cynical view that state government was  all about who knows who and who s greasing whose palm   Howe knew how to get someone in the good graces of Andrew Cuomo   she said Mr  Howe  asking for leniency  described the atmosphere in Albany that he said drove him to corruption  I had to stay relevant  and I had to stay successful   he told the judge   It was a tough environment to be in  but I did the things I needed to do to be relevant  Mr  Howe earned little sympathy during the trial itself  Prosecutors and defense lawyers revealed unsavory behavior ranging from embezzlement to doctoring emails to lying to his dog walker He was even thrown into jail in the middle of Mr  Percoco s trial  when he admitted that he had tried to defraud his credit card company at the same time that he was cooperating with the government Mr  Howe called his six months in jail in Brooklyn  a horrible situation for me   but also a  learning experience   It made me realize all the things I had lost   he said Perhaps because of Mr  Howe s unsavory history and its potential to undermine the prosecution s case  the government did not call him to testify in a second  related corruption trial  though his name was mentioned frequently there  too  That trial led to the conviction of Alain E  Kaloyeros  Mr  Cuomo s economic development guru Since Mr  Howe s release from jail  he and his wife have been living in Ketchum  Idaho  Mr  Howe works as a groundskeeper at a ski resort  maintaining a playground for the wealthy rather than patronizing one himself  as he once might have done As part of his guilty pleas  Mr  Howe must repay his old law firm  1 7 million that he embezzled and forfeit an additional  2 8 million  Their simpler life centers around the beauty of the surrounding mountains and peaceful time spent together   Mr  Howe s lawyers wrote in court papers  They said Mr  Howe had escaped from  the snaking vines of the lobbying network  After the sentencing  Mr  Howe  a wide grin on his face  shook hands with a few people in the courtroom  His lawyer  Savannah Stevenson  said Mr  Howe was  humbled  grateful and pleased  by the decision As he left the courthouse  Mr  Howe was asked if he had any message to give to Mr  Cuomo  He shook his head slightly   No   he said  

Kevin K  McAleenan  the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection  will become the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security  President Trump said in a tweet on Sunday The announcement came shortly after Mr  Trump said Kirstjen Nielsen was leaving the position  ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the agency  which oversees border security  among other duties  She had taken the job in late 2017 Mr  McAleenan  47  will oversee an agency that has at times been a target of the president s dissatisfaction over an increase of migrants illegally entering the United States at the southwestern border  I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job   Mr  Trump said in his tweet In her resignation letter  Ms  Nielsen said she hoped the incoming secretary would  have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse  Mr  McAleenan has a law degree from the University of Chicago and practiced law in California before he worked for the government  He held a variety of positions at the border protection agency before becoming its deputy commissioner in 2014 under the Obama administration  He won the country s highest civil service honor  the Presidential Rank Award  in 2015 Mr  McAleenan became the acting commissioner of the agency in January 2017 and was formally sworn in as commissioner in March 2018  He focused on counterterrorism  border security and trade enforcement  oversaw about 60 000 employees and managed a budget of over  13 billion  according to the agency As the nation s top border enforcement officer  Mr  McAleenan also helped carry out the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy to prosecute parents caught crossing the border illegally  which led to family separations  That policy was reversed  but the effects remain  In court documents filed on Friday  the government said it might take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the border In an interview in August  Mr  McAleenan said that  a better system would allow us to keep families together for the entirety of the immigration proceeding  which takes an average of 45 days  He added that there should be a penalty for crossing the border illegally  It s not a victimless crime   he said   Not only are the people at risk  so are our agents who need to apprehend or rescue them  It s also a diversionary tactic for smugglers who use family groups to tie down our agents while drugs are moved behind them  Mr  McAleenan said his job as the agency s commissioner was to enforce laws  not make them Last month  Mr  McAleenan was the public face of new government data showing that unauthorized entries at the southwestern border were reaching record breaking numbers  more than 76 000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February  an 11 year high  The system is well beyond capacity  and remains at the breaking point   he told reporters  adding that  this is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis  At a Senate hearing last month  he suggested ways to address that crisis  The United States government should support governments in Central America to improve economic opportunities there  he said  and work with the Mexican authorities to clamp down on transnational criminal organizations that prey on migrants  And we must invest in border security   he said   A modern border barrier system  additional agents and officers  additional technology at and between ports of entry  and air and marine support  And we must also have a whole of U S  government approach to address children s unique medical needs and the undeniable humanitarian challenges we are facing   

CHANGSHA  China   Inside a fishing gear store on a busy city street  the owner sits behind a counter  furiously tapping a smartphone to improve his score on an app that has nothing to do with rods  reels and bait The owner  Jiang Shuiqiu  a 35 year old army veteran  has a different obsession  earning points on Study the Great Nation  a new app devoted to promoting President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party   a kind of high tech equivalent of Mao s Little Red Book  Mr  Jiang spends several hours daily on the app  checking news about Mr  Xi and brushing up on socialist theories Tens of millions of Chinese workers  students and civil servants are now using Study the Great Nation  often under pressure from the government  It is part of a sweeping effort by Mr  Xi to strengthen ideological control in the digital age and reassert the party s primacy  as Mao once did  as the center of Chinese life  We must love our country   said Mr  Jiang  one of the top scorers on the app in Changsha  the capital of the southern province of Hunan   We are getting stronger and stronger  While many people have embraced the app as a form of patriotism  others see it as a burden imposed by overzealous officials and another sign of a growing personality cult around Mr  Xi  perhaps China s most powerful leader since Mao s time  He is using new media to fortify loyalty toward him   said Wu Qiang  a political analyst in Beijing  He likened Study the Great Nation to the little booklet of Mao quotations that was widely circulated during the chaotic and violent Cultural Revolution Since its debut this year  Study the Great Nation has become the most downloaded app on Apple s digital storefront in China  with the state news media saying it has more than 100 million registered users   a reach that would be the envy of any new app s creators But those numbers are driven largely by the party  which ordered thousands of officials across China to ensure that the app penetrates the daily routines of as many citizens as possible  whether they like it or not Schools are shaming students with low app scores  Government offices are holding study sessions and forcing workers who fall behind to write reports criticizing themselves  Private companies  hoping to curry favor with party officials  are ranking employees based on their use of the app and awarding top performers the title of  star learner  Many employers now require workers to submit daily screenshots documenting how many points they have earned ImageJiang Shuiqiu  who runs a fishing store in the city of Changsha in Hunan Province  has been lauded in the local news media for his high score on the app CreditJavier Hernandez The New York TimesPropaganda is ubiquitous in China  but experts say Study the Great Nation is different because the government is forcing people to use it and punishing those who cheat or fall behind The app allows users to earn points for staying on top of news about Mr  Xi  Watching a video about his recent visit to France  for example  earns one point  Getting a perfect score on a quiz about his economic policies earns 10 The app comes as Mr  Xi  who rose to power in 2012  is leading a broader crackdown on free speech in China  imprisoning scores of activists  lawyers and intellectuals  and imposing new restrictions on the news media  Mr  Xi has spoken frequently about what he calls the need to guard against online threats  He has warned that the party could lose its grip on power if it does not master digital media  There is no national security without internet security   Mr  Xi said in a speech this year   If we cannot succeed on the internet  we will not be able to maintain power in the long run  David Bandurski  co director of the China Media Project  said the app was a way for Mr  Xi to ensure that Chinese families are invested in the life of the party at a time when many dismiss propaganda as stilted and irrelevant  Loyalty to the party   Mr  Bandurski said   means loyalty to Xi Jinping  Study the Great Nation in some ways harkens back to the Mao era  when the chairman s portrait hung in living rooms and families studied his words feverishly  While Mr  Xi cannot yet match Mao s grandeur  he has borrowed from Mao s playbook in his quest to be seen as a singular  transformative force The app features a television series called  Xi Time  and Mr  Xi s quotations on topics like building a strong military and achieving a  Chinese dream  of prosperity and strength  The app recommends stories about Mr  Xi on its home screen and sends push notifications highlighting  golden sentences  from his latest speeches  Even the Chinese name for the app is a play on Mr  Xi s name The app  which also offers lighter fare about traditional Chinese culture  history and geography  presents a censored version of current events  Topics such as China s mass detention of Muslims are not included At Hulunbuir University in northern China  school officials monitor the scores of more than 1 100 teachers and students who use the app as part of the school s efforts to spread Mr  Xi s ideas  known in China as Xi Jinping Thought  Everyone studies voluntarily and has very high scores   said Bai Mei  an ideology instructor at the university Not everyone is as enthusiastic  In interviews  students and workers complained that superiors publicly chastised them for low scores  Others said bosses threatened to deduct pay or withhold bonuses if they did not use the app more frequently  They did not want to provide their names for fear of punishment  but some have complained online  What kind of phenomenon is this   one user wrote on Weibo  a popular social media site  complaining of a salary deduction   My God  what has happened to the party now  ImageA screen grab from the Study the Great Nation app  Since its introduction this year  it has become the most downloaded app on Apple s digital storefront in China Critics say Mr  Xi is intruding into the private lives of Chinese citizens in a way the party has typically avoided since the Mao era  The app makes the party s messages difficult to ignore  awarding points only when an article has been read completely and a video has been watched for at least three minutes  You cannot divert attention away from it   said Haiqing Yu  a professor who studies Chinese media at RMIT University in Australia   It s a kind of digital surveillance  It brings the digital dictatorship to a new level  The app  which was developed by the party s Propaganda Department and the technology giant Alibaba  is available on the Apple app store as well as Android app stores in China  The Propaganda Department keeps user data It is unclear how closely the government tracks users of Study the Great Nation  but the app requires people to provide a mobile number to register and a national identification number to access videoconference and chat features The Propaganda Department declined to comment  as did Alibaba  which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange Given the pressures to use the app  a cheating industry involving at least a dozen products has flourished  A man who listed his contact information in an online advertisement for cheating software said in an interview that many of his more than 1 000 customers saw the app as a burden imposed by bosses  He declined to provide his name for fear of retribution The government has moved swiftly to prosecute cheating and limit criticism of the app  The police in the southeastern province of Jiangxi last month detained a man who sold cheating software for about  13  The police said the man was running an illegal business The state run news media teems with glowing reviews of the app  including stories about diligent hospital workers and kindergarten teachers who open Study the Great Nation as soon as they awaken  even before they drink water or go to the bathroom The app has inspired  videos by prison guards  raps by children and adulatory song and dance routines by power plant workers  Some party members have suggested the app can be used as a dating tool to screen potential mates   If you see a guy on the subway using the app   says one cartoon   you should marry him   In Changsha  which coincidentally is an hour s drive from Mao s childhood home  the local news media has lauded Mr  Jiang  the owner of the fishing gear store  for his high scores  He and his wife sometimes answer questions on the app together at dinner  alongside their 9 year old son Mr  Jiang said his military training had inspired him to devote himself fully to Study the Great Nation  By using the app  he said  he has grown even more patriotic  President Xi has a dream of great renaissance   he said   When young people are strong  the nation is strong   

Ernest F  Hollings  a silver haired South Carolina Democrat who served 38 years in the United States Senate in an era of rising prosperity and often painful accommodation to racial tolerance in his

s senior senator  Mr  Hollings became governor  ran for president and was a revered populist who took care of the military  business interests and the folks back home Together  they were the nation s longest serving Senate pair from one state  When Mr  Thurmond died in 2003 at 100  he had been the Senate s longest tenured member after 48 years in office  Moreover  Mr  Hollings was junior senator for 36 years  itself a record  and his tenure of 38 years and 55 days  including more than two years fulfilling the term of a senator who died in office  made him the eighth longest serving senator Mr  Thurmond  a Democrat who switched to the Republican Party  never relented in his opposition to full equality for black Americans  Mr  Hollings  while remaining a fiscal conservative  evolved into a social moderate  riding winds of change that swept the South as proponents of civil rights won court cases  staged protests and endured brutalities that shocked the nation s conscience Having grown up in segregated Charleston  attended a segregated college and served in a segregated army  Mr  Hollings had little contact with poor black people and initially opposed civil rights legislation  Guided by N A A C P  officials  he toured poor black and white areas of his state in 1968 and 1969  and what he saw shocked him  rat infested slums where families subsisted on grits and greens  children

dignity   Weeks later  Harvey Gantt enrolled at Clemson without incident as its first black student By 1984  during a hopeless campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination  he called himself a centrist   strong on defense and liberal on social issues   He built his campaign around a spending freeze but endorsed racial amity  the fight against poverty and a shift away from the Reagan administration s use of military force and covert operations in Central America And by 2005  when he left the Senate  Mr  Hollings had established a long record of support for civil rights  He had also endorsed the Rev  Jesse Jackson for president in 1988  and had voted in 1991 to confirm Clarence Thomas as the second black justice of the Supreme Court ImageMr  Hollings with his wife  Patricia

Mr  Biden scrambled to defend himself and contain the crisis  the first of his possible presidential bid On Monday  a second woman accused Mr  Biden of touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable  intensifying the scrutiny of the former vice president s physical interactions with women It wasn t until Wednesday that Mr  Biden addressed the allegations in a video  saying he realized that  social norms have begun to change   But it wasn t an apology He made a convoluted  joking attempt to deal with the issue on Friday  at a conference in Washington   I m sorry I didn t

KANDAHAR  Afghanistan   Dozens of Afghan forces and Taliban fighters were killed in overnight fighting across Afghanistan  officials said Tuesday  as violence intensified ahead of another round of peace efforts to end the 18 year old war The worst of the attacks were in Kandahar Province  where the Taliban targeted an Afghan border post late Monday  killing at least four service members  according to local officials  Kasim Azad  the secretary of Kandahar s police chief  confirmed the attack and said four members of the border forces were killed But other officials put the death toll as high as 18 and said that at least eight other people were unaccounted for  possibly taken by the Taliban  Mr  Azad said 17 Taliban fighters had also been killed  The Taliban claimed to have overrun the border post  but the Afghan defense ministry said all of the attacked border posts remained under government control The violence comes a day after three American soldiers were killed near Bagram Air Base outside Kabul  Although Defense Department officials initially said that a contractor had also been killed in the attack  on Tuesday they revised their account to say that the contractor had only been wounded That attack brought the deaths of American troops in Afghanistan this year to seven  About 14 000 United States troops are currently in Afghanistan  though President Trump has asked administration officials to prepare for cutting that number in half Fighting has intensified despite a call on Sunday from Zalmay Khalilzad  the United States special envoy for Afghan peace  for a reduction in violence in the coming weeks as another round of talks are expected to get underway in the Gulf state of Qatar Those talks will be the first time the Taliban meet with Afghan government representatives in recent years  However  they are attending as part of a larger group representing all sects of the Afghan society rather than as an official government delegation Despite several rounds of negotiations with American diplomats  where the two sides are close to reaching a deal  the Taliban have so far refused direct negotiations with the Afghan government  American and Afghan officials hope the informal meeting can pave the way for direct negotiations between the two sides The violence on Monday is part of a deadly fight in the northwestern province of Badghis for the control of the Bala Murghab district  which falls on an important smuggling route along the border with Turkmenistan  The district has faced heightened pressure in recent months and it has been almost a week since the Taliban began a major offensive there At least 30 Afghan forces were killed in the initial days of fighting and the casualties have mounted since  The Afghan defense ministry said that more than 100 Taliban fighters have been killed   although those numbers could not be independently verified and the Afghan government is known to exaggerate enemy casualties The struggle of the Afghan forces has exposed their vulnerabilities ahead of what is expected to be a tough fighting season as both sides aim for battlefield gains that will increase their leverage in the peace talks It has also raised concerns that Afghan forces will surrender or flee under Taliban pressure rather than fight  particularly with the Taliban offering them better treatment for doing so  Last month  the Taliban captured about 150 Afghan forces after they fled to Turkmenistan  which turned them back  

OTTAWA   Canada is expecting foreign interference in its national election in October  and is considering stronger regulation of social media companies to ensure they block meddling in the voting  the minister responsible for election integrity said on Monday The minister spoke after the release of an updated report by Canada s electronic eavesdropping and security agency on online interference by other countries in the Canadian election  We judge it very likely that Canadian voters will encounter some form of foreign cyber interference related to the 2019 federal election   the report said   However  at this time  it is improbable that this foreign cyber interference will be of the scale of Russian activity against the 2016 United States presidential election   Canada is a target of choice for those who seek to undermine our democracy   said the minister  Karina Gould  at a news conference in Ottawa The report does not indicate what countries are likely to attack Canada  and both Harjit Sajjan  the defense minister  and Shelly Bruce  who heads the electronic security agency  declined to elaborate Ms  Gould also criticized Google  Twitter and Facebook for not providing the Canadian government with the same degree of information they have offered Europe about their efforts to mitigate possible election interference  We have not really seen that much progress with them   she said  adding that the major social media platforms have declined to give the government regular updates about what they are observing and what they are doing to prevent any misbehavior  There s a lot left to be desired in terms of how seriously they re taking these issues   she said Kevin Chan  the head of public policy for Facebook Canada  said the company plans to introduce new rules for paid political advertising in Canada and is making efforts to block foreign meddling in elections  We take the protection of election integrity on our platform extremely seriously at Facebook  and we want to be a force for good in Canadian democracy   he said in a statement ImageKarina Gould was sworn in as the Canadian minister responsible for election integrity in 2017 CreditSean Kilpatrick The Canadian Press  via Associated PressColin McKay  head of government policy at Google Canada  said the company had met several times with several branches of the Canadian government to discuss  transparency  cybersecurity and information  The company is also working with Canada s Canadian Center for Cyber Security  a government agency  on preventing malicious attacks  Twitter declined to comment  We have every intention of continuing our close work with government to protect Canada s democratic institutions and election activities   Mr  McKay said in a statement The company did not address Ms  Gould s call for formal regulation Ms  Gould said Canada was reviewing its laws to see how they can be used to force action by online companies  and also considering new legislation It is also reviewing steps by other countries  including Britain s proposal on Monday to set up a social media regulator  and recent changes to Australia s laws that  among other things  could lead to the jailing of  executives from social media companies if they do not  expeditiously  remove content with graphic violence on their platforms  We are having active conversations with our partners and allies around the world as to what this would look like in the Canadian context   Ms  Gould said She added   The platforms have been able to avoid being held to account for what takes place on their platforms for too long  Separately on Monday  Facebook banned several Canadians and groups that promote white supremacy In a statement  the company said it was shutting down accounts held by Faith Goldy  a far right former mayoral candidate in Toronto  and several groups including the Soldiers of Odin and the Canadian Nationalist Front The report was issued by the Communications Security Establishment  which is a branch of the military and headed by Ms  Bruce  It issued a similar report in 2017 Earlier this year  the government set up a committee with representatives from the civil service  the security service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to look for signs of interference in this year s vote The report found that any interference is likely to be limited to the spread of misinformation during the campaign  It concluded that any interference in voting results was highly unlikely because Canada still uses paper ballots in national votes  

JERUSALEM   Benjamin Netanyahu s apparent re election as prime minister of Israel attests to a starkly conservative vision of the Jewish state and its people about where they are and where they are headed They prize stability  as well as the military and economic security that Mr  Netanyahu has delivered Though in many ways they have never been safer  they remain afraid   especially of Iran and its influence over their neighbors  against which Mr  Netanyahu has relentlessly crusaded  They are persuaded by his portrayal of those who challenge him  whether Arab citizens or the left  as enemies of the state  They take his resemblance to authoritarian leaders around the world as evidence that he was ahead of the curve They credit Mr  Netanyahu  whose strategic vision values power and fortitude above all  with piloting Israel to unprecedented diplomatic heights and believe still more is possible  And they are loath to let anyone less experienced take the controls  Let s be honest with ourselves   said Michael B  Oren  a former Israeli ambassador to Washington   Our economy is excellent  our foreign relations were never better  and we re secure  We ve got a guy in politics for 40 years  We know him  the world knows him   even our enemies know him  Not everyone is so enamored of him Mr  Netanyahu s coalition appears to have won 65 of the 120 seats in Parliament  But his positions on the issues differed little from those of his main challenger  Benny Gantz  suggesting that close to half of the electorate would have simply preferred someone else in the job As he assembles a new coalition  how Mr  Netanyahu manages that divide will be his first test  With a new term and an expanded Likud party  he could form an even larger right wing coalition of secular  ultra Orthodox and even some extremist lawmakers   or  if he chooses  he could to try to forge a national unity government that brings in centrists Whatever he decides  Mr  Netanyahu has been afforded the opportunity to lead Israel through a serious turning point in its history as both a Jewish and a democratic state  if his legal troubles do not topple him first An election that was all about personality and character   whether Mr  Netanyahu s likely indictment on corruption charges made him unfit to continue in the job  or whether Mr  Gantz  was up to it   left little room for issues of policy To his credit  Mr  Gantz  who conceded on Wednesday  won a record number of Parliament seats for a new party  But Mr  Netanyahu proved once again that his talents  stamina and willingness to do what it takes to win are all unmatched in Israeli politics But serious concerns for Israel that were essentially set aside in the campaign are fast approaching  As he surpasses David Ben Gurion  Israel s founding leader  as its longest serving prime minister this summer  Mr  Netanyahu will be unable to ignore any of them for long Peace with the Palestinians remains as unlikely as ever  despite the possible wild card of a long awaited proposal from the Trump administration  Mr  Netanyahu s right wing allies  to whom he may be even more beholden under his next coalition  are champing at the bit to pursue annexation of the occupied West Bank In desperation to rally the pro settler base  Mr  Netanyahu said publicly three days before the election that he would begin applying Israeli sovereignty to parts of the West Bank that the Palestinians demand for their future state  Opponents believe this would set off a new Palestinian uprising  bring to fruition the apartheid regime the Israeli left has long warned against  or both ImageConstruction in the Israeli settlement of Beitar Illit last year  Mr  Netanyahu said during the campaign that he would begin applying Israeli sovereignty to parts of the occupied West Bank CreditMenahem Kahana Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesEven without annexation in the mix  Mr  Netanyahu s settler  and ultra Orthodox dominated government  and his effusive embrace of President Trump  have rapidly alienated Israel from predominantly liberal and less observant American Jews  the largest diaspora community and a pillar of Israel s security since its founding Israel is becoming a partisan issue in the United States like never before  already forcing those seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020   including Bernie Sanders  Pete Buttigieg and Beto O Rourke   to distinguish their support for Israel from their disapproval of Mr  Netanyahu s policies Finally  though it has received little notice outside Israel  a power struggle between the judiciary   one of the country s last redoubts of assertive liberalism   and ascendant ethnonationalists has been building toward a showdown that could sharply alter the nature of Israeli democracy While conservatives have been working to curtail the Supreme Court s power through legislation  the court itself has been laying the groundwork to assert judicial review over even the so called basic laws that Parliament considers the building blocks of an eventual constitution  which Israel now lacks  Imagine the American Supreme Court judging the constitutionality of part of the Constitution itself   said Gadi Taub  a historian and Hebrew University professor who opposes settlements and annexation but supports a rollback of judicial authority Mr  Netanyahu has not led the effort to rein in the Supreme Court  but he has railed against the legal system as a whole  over the long running police corruption investigations that have led to his expected indictment on bribery and fraud charges That campaign  too  is expected to present a challenge for Israel s democratic system  Mr  Netanyahu is now almost certain to try to extract a deal from his coalition partners to pass a law retroactively granting him immunity from prosecution Israelis have grown accustomed to Mr  Netanyahu s bullish PowerPoint assessments of the country s condition  10 years of uninterrupted economic growth  its best ever credit rating  and diplomatic openings and new trading partners in Africa  Asia and Latin America  During the campaign  they also got used to clips showing Mr  Trump granting recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital and of Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights  both coveted national goals ImageMr  Netanyahu with President Trump and other officials in March  as the United States recognized Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesDorit Rabinyan  an author who calls herself left wing  said Israelis feared Mr  Netanyahu s exit as if they would be  orphaned   And she confessed to having a tinge of the same feeling herself   I m anxious about it at the very same time that I m hopeful about it   she said Critics point to a yawning income gap between those prospering in Israel s high tech industry and those in the middle class or living outside the major cities  A housing crunch  clogged highways and a crushing cost of living are keeping many young adults in their parents  homes and driving others to emigrate That gave Mr  Netanyahu s opponents on the left and even the center right ample ammunition  He s provided short term profits at a very high long term price   said Ari Shavit  a Jerusalem born journalist who has followed Mr  Netanyahu throughout his career   Netanyahu s Israel is mortgaged  And we are going to pay dearly  Mr  Shavit said the same could be said for Mr  Netanyahu s failure to use Israel s position of strength and strategic comfort    this golden moment    to take on its single most existential issue  the Palestinian conflict  and for his exploitation of Mr  Trump s largess at the cost of  endangering the relationship with Democratic America  younger America and the next administration in Washington  Mr  Taub said he expected Mr  Netanyahu to continue his decade long practice of slow walking settlement expansion  as the right complains  and sabotaging peace talks  as the left complains  Gantz  with his high talk of values  optimism  change  sounded like Obama in 2008   Mr  Taub said   But no one in Israel thinks there s really an option to annex the West Bank or make peace  So it will be the triumph of the status quo  ImagePalestinian protesters facing Israeli troops in the West Bank  Analysts believe the extension of Israeli sovereignty could touch off a Palestinian uprising CreditAbbas Momani Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBut Mr  Oren said he believed that a Trump peace plan was forthcoming  and that Mr  Netanyahu was best suited to reach a deal  at last  no matter how much his coalition partners fought it  It s the old adage  The left makes war  the right makes peace   Mr  Oren said   Netanyahu will be extremely loath to say no to Trump  which could prove to be the success of that program  On the West Bank  however  few share that view Ghassan Khatib  a professor at Bir Zeit University and former spokesman for the Palestinian government  said Mr  Netanyahu s long tenure had already left behind two devastating casualties  any hope for a two state solution and any support for moderate Palestinian leadership  whose investment in a diplomatic solution to the conflict Mr  Netanyahu has discredited Mr  Khatib said that Mr  Netanyahu  by politically empowering the extreme right wing in recent years  had contributed to a radicalization that has made Israelis averse to peacemaking   The Israel that we talk about now is not the Israel we negotiated with 25 years ago   he said   I think that Netanyahu s taking us into some kind of apartheid reality  It is precisely because Mr  Netanyahu has been so successful that some on the left argue that his leadership is undermining Israel s seemingly irrepressible democracy Anshel Pfeffer  the author of  Bibi   a critical biography of Mr  Netanyahu  said he believed that by campaigning as the  indispensable man   Mr  Netanyahu had  created a narrative where it s illegitimate or irresponsible to replace him  ImageCampaign posters in Rheovot  Israel  Mr  Netanyahu is on track to surpass David Ben Gurion  Israel s founding leader  as its longest serving prime minister CreditDan Balilty for The New York Times There s a certain justification for that   Mr  Pfeffer said  The left wing always said   Here s the deal  If you don t solve your issues with the Palestinians and end the occupation  and resolve your outstanding issues with Arab countries  you won t realize your incredible potential     he said   You ll have a spartan lifestyle  you ll have to go to war all the time  and the world may isolate you   the diplomatic tsunami  And it s inarguable that in the last 10 years  Netanyahu has broken this paradigm  Yet  at the same time  Mr  Netanyahu has fueled and directed the right wing s animosity at predominantly liberal institutions like the courts  the police  higher education and the news media  To the left  Israeli democracy is on the defensive  To the ethnonationalist right  which succeeded last year in enshrining Israel s self definition as the nation state of the Jews in a basic law  it is in need of an adjustment  Somebody told me that Israel went really far on the democracy side  and now we have to rebalance it   said Dahlia Scheindlin  a liberal pollster and writer   They see it as a corrective  that Israel has too healthy a democracy  Some  including Mr  Gantz  have warned that Mr  Netanyahu was headed down a path toward a regime like that of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey Mr  Pfeffer said Israel was not there yet  Those other countries don t have the institutions that can indict the prime minister   he said   It hasn t happened here  the media and judiciary are still strong  But once you erode democracy  you make it much easier for the incumbent to win  ImageJerusalem s Old City in 2017  Mr  Netanyahu s government  and his effusive embrace of President Trump  have

WASHINGTON   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo left open the possibility on Wednesday of entering a conflict with Iran without first seeking explicit congressional approval  telling senators  there is no doubt there is a connection  between Al Qaeda and Iran His comments came two days after the Trump administration designated Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist group  and were likely to fuel concerns of American military action against the country Senator Rand Paul  Republican of Kentucky  pushed Mr  Pompeo to commit that the Trump administration would not attack Iran under a war authorization allowing the use of military force against Al Qaeda and other extremist groups responsible for the terrorist attacks of Sept  11  2001 Mr  Pompeo demurred  saying he would  prefer to just leave that to lawyers  Mr  Paul  a libertarian who promotes isolationist policies  said he was troubled by Mr  Pompeo s response   I can tell you explicitly  you have not been given power or authority by Congress to have war with Iran   he said in the exchange at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Mr  Pompeo pivoted  noting ties between Iran and Al Qaeda   There is no doubt there is a connection  Period  Full stop  After the Sept  11 attacks  and as American forces prepared to bomb Afghanistan  more than a dozen senior Qaeda members fled to Iran  The circumstances of their living conditions were murky  but at least some were detained and later traded  in a prisoner swap with a Qaeda branch in Yemen  Hamza bin Laden  a son of Osama bin Laden  was believed to be among those living in Iran after the 2001 attacks  he is now considered a rising Qaeda leader Over several administrations  American officials have interpreted and stretched the 2001 authorization for use of force against the perpetrators of the Sept  11 terrorist attacks as granting legal permission to wage an armed conflict against not just Al Qaeda and the Taliban  but also other Sunni Islamist groups with links to Al Qaeda in the Middle East and North Africa It is not clear how the Trump administration could plausibly say Iran is an ally of Al Qaeda and participated in the Sept  11 attacks  Among other things  Al Qaeda and its affiliates are Sunni extremists who consider adherents of the Shiite branch of Islam  like Iran s government  to be heretics Mr  Pompeo has been a ringleader in the Trump administration s pressure campaign against Iran  The terrorist designation that he announced on Monday was the first by the United States against an official entity in another country s government It also appeared to pique Mr  Paul s questioning about whether the United States was outlining a foundation for war  Mr  Pompeo called the designation against the Iranian military unit a  recognition of reality  Additionally  Mr  Pompeo was asked to affirm support for a two state solution in the Israeli Palestinian conflict  as have previous Republican and Democratic administrations  He declined to answer when asked to describe what the United States would do if the Israeli government tried to annex the West Bank  widely seen as the foundation for a Palestinian state  The old set of ideas aren t worth retreading   he said in a reiteration of answers he gave at a Senate hearing on Tuesday   They have simply not succeeded  Pressed by Senator Tim Kaine  Democrat of Virginia  on whether a two state solution was an  old idea   Mr  Pompeo replied   I would argue that millions of man hours have been spent to try to build out a two state solution  It hasn t worked to date  it may work this afternoon  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  who appeared to win a fifth term Tuesday  said last weekend that he would apply sovereignty to some or all of the West Bank if re elected  A framework for peace negotiations is likely to be unveiled soon by Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law and Middle East adviser  although it is not expected to insist on a two state solution or on ceding sovereignty to the Palestinians Mr  Pompeo said the peace framework would contain  things that neither of them like   referring to Israeli and Palestinian leaders   but things that the Gulf States think make sense  Mr  Kushner has sought approval for his plan from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia  but the kingdom has been critical of Mr  Trump s decision in 2017 to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  who emerged from this week s election poised to win a fourth consecutive term  may benefit from an effort by his right wing coalition to protect him from prosecution on possible corruption charges At least one right wing party expected to join his new governing coalition has been open about its goal of passing a law granting immunity to Israeli Parliament members  including prime ministers Mr  Netanyahu  who worked on Wednesday to consolidate support for a new coalition  is on track to become Israel s longest serving prime minister  but also the first to be charged with a crime while in office  If Netanyahu gains the public s trust in the coming elections   Bezalel Smotrich  leader of the Union of Right Wing Parties  wrote on Twitter last month   it will be imperative to enact a law that will prevent him standing trial  Mr  Smotrich said parliamentary immunity was necessary to honor the people s democratic choice and ensure smooth government  By Wednesday  his party was projected to win five seats in the 120 seat Knesset  or parliament An aide said on Wednesday that Mr  Smotrich was demanding the post of justice minister and another leader of his party wanted to be minister of education ImageBezalel Smotrich  center  the leader of the Union of Right Wing Parties  said it was  imperative  that legislation be enacted to prevent Mr  Netanyahu from standing trial CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesMany countries grant lawmakers immunity  Israel too used to have such a law Until 2005  Israeli lawmakers had immunity that could only be removed by a vote of Parliament  The law was changed in 2005 after Supreme Court petitions to lift immunity in several cases where Parliament had denied it Mr  Netanyahu could request immunity by an act of Parliament now without a new law  but legal experts said the Supreme Court would be likely to reverse the decision for fear of harming the public s trust in government institutions Two ultra Orthodox parties whose support Mr  Netanyahu will need to help him build a governing majority are unlikely to oppose legislation restoring automatic immunity for members of Parliament Two of their leaders  Yaakov Litzman  of United Torah Judaism  and Aryeh Deri  of Shas  have recently been under police investigation themselves  Moshe Gafni  a lawmaker from United Torah Judaism  said his party would wait and see how Mr  Netanyahu s cases proceeded Israel s attorney general said in February that he planned to indict Mr  Netanyahu on charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  Mr  Netanyahu  who denies any wrongdoing  is entitled to a hearing before an indictment is issued Mr  Netanyahu has said in the past that he would not promote a new immunity law  But when pressed in a television interview days before the election  he was more evasive  saying only that he was currently  not dealing  with the issue Some potential coalition partners have spoken out against an immunity law  saying they oppose any personalized and retroactive legislation designed to help Mr  Netanyahu  Some senior members of his own conservative Likud party have expressed similar sentiments ImageThe Jewish settlement outpost of Yishuv Hadaat in the West Bank  in 2016  Critics say Mr  Netanyahu may promise right wing parties that he would support the annexation of Jewish settlements in occupied territory in exchange for their support for an immunity law CreditUriel Sinai for The New York TimesYuli Edelstien  the No  2 in Likud and long time Parliament speaker  told reporters last week that Mr  Netanyahu  like everybody else  should be treated as innocent until proven guilty  Regarding immunity  Mr  Edelstein said   No one is seriously discussing this kind of legislation in the Israeli Knesset  But Mr  Netanyahu s critics suspect that he may promise right wing parties that he would support the annexation of some Jewish settlements in the West Bank in exchange for their support for an immunity law The liberal Haaretz newspaper said Wednesday that the two goals of the emerging government  could be summed up as  immunity in exchange for sovereignty   In a surprise announcement a few days before the election  Mr  Netanyahu pledged  to begin extending sovereignty into the occupied West Bank  a popular cause on the Israeli right and within his own party  He had resisted such a policy in the past  and much of the world would consider it a violation of international law Mr  Smotrich s aide  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be able to discuss internal party affairs  vehemently denied any linkage between immunity and sovereignty  He said Mr  Smotrich had never discussed the immunity law with Mr  Netanyahu  and needed no encouragement or payback to support either immunity or annexation Shortly before Mr  Netanyahu s unexpected announcement  Mr  Edelstein  the Likud official  said he had not heard of any proposal to impose sovereignty in the West Bank  though Likud favored it in principle Amir Fuchs  an expert in legislative processes at the Israel Democracy Institute  a nonpartisan research group in

LONDON   With the clock ticking down toward last minute talks in Brussels on Britain s withdrawal from the European Union  Prime Minister Theresa May this weekend took another step away from hard line anti Europe lawmakers in her Conservative Party and sought to portray herself as committed to compromise talks that stalled last week But opposition Labour leaders on Sunday maintained that Mrs  May had not yet bent to any of their demands on the withdrawal  known as Brexit  And whatever overtures she makes to Labour  analysts said  she will struggle to guarantee that her successor as prime minister or a future Parliament will not rip up any compromise deal   a major sticking point in the cross party talks Mrs  May this week was expected to seek another delay to Britain s departure from European leaders who have expressed anger at her reluctance to change strategy only days before they were to meet to consider her request  She is also trying to pressure Labour lawmakers who may be searching for an excuse to back a deal to avoid being seen as thwarting Brexit Let me explain what s happening with Brexit pic twitter com gjGkvFk8fT  Theresa May   theresa may  April 7  2019 But while Mrs  May appeared to soften her tone in a statement late Saturday  any compromise talks face an extremely challenging road ahead  Presumably  there is some aspect of trying to convince the E U  of her good faith in those talks   said Tim Bale  a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London  But he said the European leaders  now schooled in the stubborn realities of domestic British politics  were likely to see that a compromise between Mrs  May and Labour s leader  Jeremy Corbyn  remained very far off ImageMrs  May in the House of Commons in London on Wednesday  On Saturday  she suggested a compromise could be worked out around a more limited goal  regaining control over immigration from continental Europe CreditMark Duffy UK Parliament The other game she s playing   Professor Bale said   is to try to prove to everybody outside the country and inside the country that she s genuinely tried  and therefore the only solution is to back her original deal  That would most likely take the form of government efforts to allow Parliament to vote on a series of different Brexit plans  from her deal to softer proposals preferred by Labour lawmakers  Parliament has tried that before  only to find itself unable to give any plan a majority of votes  But Mrs  May has suggested she may try to restart the process and put the government s weight behind whichever plan had the most support Mrs  May had vowed for months that she would back only a Brexit plan that eventually took Britain out of Europe s main economic structures  but on Saturday night she suggested that a compromise could be worked out around a more limited goal  regaining control over immigration from continental Europe That would open the door to a plan that met some of Labour s demands  namely for Britain to remain in a European customs union  Britain would not charge tariffs on European products under such a plan  preventing the country from striking trade deals with other countries but also preserving reasonably frictionless trade with the bloc  Britain s biggest trading partner But government officials said on Sunday that any suggestions of openness to a customs union compromise were speculative  And while Labour leaders stressed that talks had been cordial and that both sides remained interested in seeking a compromise  they said the prime minister had not yet budged on substantive pieces of her deal ImageTrucks at the Port of Dover in February  The prospect of high tariffs on European goods is one of the worries about a so called hard Brexit CreditToby Melville Reuters The sad thing is at the moment we haven t seen overall any real changes to the deal   Rebecca Long Bailey  a senior Labour official who has been involved in the negotiations  said in a televised interview   But we re hopeful that that will change in coming days  and we re willing to continue the talks  as we know the government are  Cross party talks between Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn stalled on Friday  and despite both sides saying they were willing to return to the table  neither the government nor Labour officials gave any indication on Sunday of a concrete schedule for further talks British news media reports said Mrs  May had argued in talks with Labour that her original plan  while it did not explicitly keep Britain in the customs union  achieved the same goal by other means  Her plan has been voted down three times in Parliament Mrs  May s statement on Saturday appeared to be an effort to signal new openness to those talks  suggesting that a deal could be worked out so long as it ended free movement  the right of Europeans to work and travel throughout the bloc  Labour also formally supports ending free movement  though it has lately also supported plans that would preserve it  The fact is that on Brexit there are areas where the two main parties agree   Mrs  May said   We both want to end free movement  we both want to leave with a good deal  and we both want to protect jobs  ImageDonald Tusk  the president of the European Council  center left  last month with Jean Claude Juncker  the president of the European Commission  Mr  Tusk supports

swell of pressure from within his party to reject any compromise that does not include giving Britons a second public vote on leaving Europe with a deal or canceling Brexit altogether That goes well beyond what Mrs  May said on Saturday that she was willing to consider What awaits Mrs  May if she agrees to a compromise deal is perhaps an even bigger tremor in the Conservative Party  Some Conservative lawmakers have threatened new attempts to oust her if she allows Brexit to be delayed long enough that Britons are asked to vote in European Parliament elections in May   Their options for how to remove her  though  are limited after an earlier attempt failed  Reports in the British news media on Sunday said that Mrs  May was offering legal guarantees to protect Labour lawmakers from their biggest fear   that a staunch pro Brexit successor to Mrs  May would rip up the parties  compromise plan and embark on a much more complete split with Europe  The move was described in The Sunday Times  a British newspaper  as the  Boris lock   a nod to Boris Johnson  the extreme anti Europe lawmaker who is angling to follow Mrs  May as prime minister and may be inclined to upend her plan  ImageA pro Brexit supporter in London last week  Mrs  May has conceded that efforts to convert hard line anti Europe Conservative lawmakers to her Brexit deal have failed CreditDylan Martinez ReutersBut the outlines of Britain s future relationship with Europe  including a possible customs union  would be made in a nonbinding part of Mrs  May s exit deal  making it difficult to protect from future attempts to derail it Professor Bale  of Queen Mary University  said that while she might be trying to provide cover for Labour lawmakers already inclined to back her deal  there was little of substance she could offer them  Any guarantees given to Labour on that score would not be worth the paper they re written on   he said In the backdrop of Mrs  May s efforts to temper her approach is a chorus of European leaders accusing Mrs  May of having so far failed to come up with a fresh plan to break months of Parliamentary stalemate French officials went so far as to say that if Mrs  May failed to outline a new plan with  credible political backing   they would treat it as a decision to greenlight a no deal exit  a possibility that experts say would be disastrous for Britain s economy European leaders will meet on Wednesday to consider Mrs  May s request for another delay to Brexit  The Irish prime minister  Leo Varadkar  whose country stands to be badly affected by a no deal exit  said he expected European leaders to postpone Brexit to avert that outcome  however angry they might be about Britain s conduct Donald Tusk  the president of the European Council  was pushing European leaders to offer Mrs  May a one year extension for Brexit while keeping open the possibility of an earlier withdrawal if Britain ratifies a deal  

JERUSALEM   Struggling to rally right wing voters before Tuesday s elections  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he would start to extend Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if given a fourth consecutive term Such a move has been ardently sought by the settler movement but resisted until now by Mr  Netanyahu  and by more moderate Israelis  as a potentially fatal blow to a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  In the eyes of most of the world  it would also be a violation of international law that bars the annexation of land seized in war But Mr  Netanyahu trailed his main challenger  Benny Gantz  a former army chief of staff  in final polls of the campaign published Friday  And he has been frantically trying to mobilize conservative Israelis to vote for his Likud party rather than for other  more extremist parties whose leaders have joined his government but have often portrayed him as more of a brake on the settler movement than an accelerator Mr  Netanyahu was pressed in a live television interview Saturday night over why he had not already annexed settlement blocs like Maale Adumim and Gush Etzion  two large Jewish communities built on occupied territory on the outskirts of Jerusalem  He vowed to begin the effective annexation of those and other  more isolated areas under Jewish control  The question you re asking is an interesting one  Will we move on now to the next stage   he said   And the answer is  yes  We will move on to the next stage  Asked by his interviewer if that meant he would annex the settlement blocs  Mr  Netanyahu said yes  but that he would not stop there  I m going to apply sovereignty  but I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlement points  because from my perspective every such point of settlement is Israeli   he said   We have a responsibility as the Israeli government  I won t uproot anyone and I won t place them under Palestinian sovereignty  I ll look out for everyone  The West Bank is home to about 2 8 million Palestinians and more than 400 000 Jewish settlers Mr  Netanyahu did not say whether he would seek to annex areas now under Palestinian control under the Oslo Accords Applying sovereignty to Israeli settlements on West Bank land that the Palestinians demand for a future state  presumably along with the roads and infrastructure tethering those places to the rest of Israel  would leave the Palestinians at best with an archipelago of disconnected territory  The West Bank is now under Israeli military jurisdiction  though settlers are subject to civilian law  as Israeli citizens ImageA Palestinian family tending their vineyard in the West Bank with the the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the background  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he will begin extending Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if re elected CreditTomas Munita for The New York TimesThe chief negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization  Saeb Erekat  responded to Mr  Netanyahu s statements by attacking both him and the Trump administration  The White House has long promised a proposal for a  deal of the century  to end the Israeli Palestinian conflict But in the meantime  it has showered Mr  Netanyahu with priceless political gifts   from last year s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital to last month s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights   while battering the Palestinians with aid cuts and public scoldings  Such a statement by Netanyahu is not surprising   Mr  Erekat said on Twitter   Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity  particularly with the Trump administration s support and endorsement of Israel s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine  He added   We ll continue to pursue our rights through international forums  including the international criminal court  until we achieve our long overdue justice  Shalom Lipner  a former aide to Mr  Netanyahu and several other prime ministers  said Mr  Netanyahu might well believe the Trump administration could allow him to proceed with annexation  But he called the promise  the ultimate Hail Mary pass   and one that came with little political risk  The only reason it s even credible now is because of what he s been able to coordinate with Trump   said Mr  Lipner  an analyst at the Atlantic Council   Maybe he can actually get Trump to sign off on that as well  But if it became clear it s not in the cards right now  then he can just say   Sorry  I can t swing it  Conditions change    Read our guide on Israel s elections  In the television interview  Mr  Netanyahu vowed not to divide Jerusalem or  uproot any settlement   and said he would  ensure that we will control the territory west of the Jordan River   meaning the entire West Bank When asked if he would push through before Tuesday the much delayed evacuation of Palestinians living in Khan al Ahmar  a Bedouin village near the Maale Adumim settlement bloc  he reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state on the West Bank  I don t know whether it will be before the elections   he said of the Khan al Ahmar expulsion  which set off intense international criticism after being marked for demolition to make way for an expanded Jewish settlement But  he added   We have to control our destiny  and that is going to be impossible if we place there an independent  Arab entity   an Arab state  for all intents and purposes  A Palestinian state  That will endanger our existence   

WASHINGTON   The Treasury Department allowed the influential Russian oligarch Oleg V  Deripaska to satisfy the terms of his divorce by transferring tens of millions of dollars in stock to benefit his children as part of a deal to lift United States sanctions on his corporate empire  according to the Trump administration and an interview with Mr  Deripaska The deal  announced by the Trump administration in December without publicly disclosing its details  included a clause providing for the completion of a transfer of 10 5 million shares of Mr  Deripaska s main holding company  EN   to a trust fund for the two teenage children he had with his former wife  Polina Yumasheva The couple divorced last year  and their settlement  which called for him to provide funds for their children  was finalized before Mr  Deripaska and his companies were sanctioned in April 2018  according to representatives of the Treasury Department  Mr  Deripaska and EN  The transfer has drawn the ire of Senator Ron Wyden  Democrat of Oregon  who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee  which has jurisdiction over the Treasury Department  He said in a letter sent late last month to Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  that the transfer of the EN  shares   which had a value of more than  78 million at the close of business on Monday    constitutes a clear benefit to Deripaska and his children   and conflicts with Treasury Department claims that neither would benefit from the sanctions relief deal The sanctions were intended to punish seven oligarchs and their companies   including Mr  Deripaska  EN  and the giant aluminum company it controls  Rusal   for their affiliations with a Russian government that  engages in a range of malign activity around the globe   including election interference  Mr  Mnuchin said at the time When the Treasury Department announced the deal with Mr  Deripaska s companies to lift the sanctions  it cast the move as an effort to stabilize global aluminum markets roiled by the sanctions  and said that Mr  Deripaska would not personally benefit  As part of the deal  he agreed to relinquish control of the companies and sell off a significant portion of his ownership  with proceeds going into blocked accounts that he would not be able to access But members of Congress on both sides of the aisle blasted the deal as soft on Russia  and unsuccessfully tried to block it from going into effect  Those concerns were inflamed further when it was revealed that the confidential  legally binding document detailing the agreement showed that Mr  Deripaska and his allies would retain majority ownership of EN  The agreement specified that 1 64 percent of the shares of EN  would be transferred to an entity called the Liberi Foundation  for which there was no easily traceable public record  After receiving inquiries from journalists  EN  officials said Liberi was a trust fund for Mr  Deripaska s children But when asked by Mr  Wyden at a Senate Finance Committee hearing late last month about the arrangement  Mr  Mnuchin said of Mr  Deripaska that  his children did in no way benefit from sanctions relief  A Treasury Department spokeswoman sought to clarify Mr  Mnuchin s statement last week  saying that  Deripaska s children were legally entitled to shares stemming from a divorce settlement that predated the sanctions  Larissa Belyaeva  a spokeswoman for Mr  Deripaska  said in a statement that he  disclaimed all rights to claw back those shares  She added   Nor did his children benefit as all that was honored was a pre existing legal entitlement to settle shares as part of a divorce settlement  She said the votes from the shares would be cast by independent trustees appointed by the Treasury Department Independent trustees also will control the votes associated with shares owned by other people or entities with connections to Mr  Deripaska  They include his charitable foundation  his former wife  her father and a family linked firm called Orandy Capital Limited  as well as shares being transferred to VTB  a Russian government owned bank under limited United States sanctions that had lent Mr  Deripaska large sums of money And in a rare interview late last month  Mr  Deripaska said of the transfer to Liberi   It s a small portion of the shares  And it was part of my settlement with my wife  which was set long before  Last month  Mr  Deripaska sued the Treasury Department and its officials  including Mr  Mnuchin  to reverse the sanctions that remain in place on him personally  claiming that he was deprived due process and that the sanctions cost him billions of dollars and made him  radioactive  in international business circles In the interview with The New York Times  he blasted the sanctions as targeting him solely because he was a prominent Russian who has  a popular brand in the U S  He accused the Treasury Department of misrepresenting him in its justification for the sanctions  In announcing the sanctions  the department had noted that  Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state  Mr  Deripaska explained the statement to mean that  it was just who I am   I am Russian   he said   And unfortunately  I was sanctioned because I am Russian  He added   I m not planning to leave Russia to buy a hockey club  a football club  to spend crazy money on luxury things outside my country  I spend most of my time here  My kids are here  And my future also will be in Russia   

Israel s parliamentary election on Tuesday brings an end to a neck and neck campaign that saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  the veteran politician of the Israeli right and one of the country s longest serving leaders  facing the strongest challenge in years  Mr  Netanyahu s tenure has been marked by a collapse of peace talks with the Palestinians  confrontation with Iran  armed conflict with Hamas  and hostility toward what he views as plots to isolate and delegitimize the Jewish state But Mr  Netanyahu has also overseen an era of healthy economic growth and stability  thawed relations with Sunni Arab leaders and expanded Israeli trade ties in Africa  Latin America and Asia   Read more on Mr  Netanyahu s ties with President Trump that have emboldened him to take policy risks  The prime minister is entangled in corruption scandals that could lead to his indictment  And he faces stiff competition from a new rival  Benny Gantz  the leader of a trio of former generals who could end Mr  Netanyahu s 10 uninterrupted years as prime minister But Israeli elections are complicated and unpredictable  with many parties vying for votes and at times forming opportunistic alliances to secure a parliamentary majority ImageThe Blue and White alliance is led by Benny Gantz  center  and two other veteran generals  They have teamed up with a centrist party led by Yair Lapid

White alliance  a coalition named for the colors of the Israeli flag  slightly ahead of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  a dominant force on the Israeli right for decades Their policy stances are similar  a reflection of how Israeli politics have moved increasingly to the right under Mr  Netanyahu  But while Mr  Gantz has sought allies from across the spectrum  Mr  Netanyahu has reached out to the far right to strengthen his prospects for a parliamentary majority  He even has promised to begin extending sovereignty over the occupied West Bank  which the Palestinians want for a future state  if he is re elected The Blue and White leaders are drawing on their military backgrounds to counter Mr  Netanyahu s contention that only he can protect Israel  Mr  Gantz and his colleagues have also focused on the corruption accusations against Mr  Netanyahu  his biggest vulnerability  to press their case that new leadership is needed They have attracted backing from smaller centrist parties  And what remains of the left leaning opposition has thrown its support behind Mr  Gantz for prime minister  The Labor Party would be likely to recommend Mr  Gantz for the premiership after the election What makes this election different Mr  Netanyahu could be indicted  Israel s attorney general announced last month that he planned to bring charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  A final decision on charges is likely by year s end  Under the current law  Mr  Netanyahu  if re elected  would not have to resign until a final conviction  although new legislation or public pressure could force him to step down  Mr  Netanyahu has described the charges as a baseless partisan witch hunt  But with a first sitting prime minister to be charged  Israel would be entering uncharted legal and political terrain The uncertainty has worked against Mr  Netanyahu in the prelude to the vote   The attorney general s report has done something that has never happened in Israel s 70 year history  and that is that a prime minister is under a legal cloud   said David Makovsky  an expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  The election also is the first time that three former heads of the army  the Israel Defense Forces  have united to run for office  The Blue and White alliance is led by Mr  Gantz and two other veteran generals  Gabi Ashkenazi and Moshe Yaalon They have teamed up with a well known centrist party  Yesh Atid  led by Yair Lapid  a former journalist  television host and finance minister  Mr  Gantz has agreed to hand off the prime minister position to Mr  Lapid after two and a half years if their parties win  While Mr  Netanyahu has a strong record of defending Israel  the Blue and White alliance s military credentials have made it more difficult for him to attack Mr  Gantz and his colleagues as weak on security   The question is  will it neutralize the advantage that Netanyahu has accrued over his previous four terms of being  Mr  Security    Mr  Makovsky said   He s said the words Israelis want to hear   I ll keep you safe    How does the voting work Voters cast ballots for parties  not individual candidates  to fill seats in the 120 member Knesset  or Parliament  The seats are divided proportionally based on the percentage of the vote each party receives  Any party that wins 3 25 percent or more of the vote gets at least one seat  If parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes won t be counted  That will raise the share of seats given to the other parties  If one party were to win at least 61 seats  it would be entitled to form a government  But this has never happened in Israeli politics  So once the seats have been apportioned  parties try to cobble together coalitions that control a majority of seats  ImageAn election billboard for the New Right party  with which Likud is expected to align CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat might those alliances look like Polls have suggested that Likud and Blue and White will each get about 30 seats   meaning both will be seeking alliances with smaller parties  Likud is expected to align with a  right wing party known as the New Right  and with an extreme right alliance known as the Union of Right Wing Parties  which includes Jewish Power  widely criticized as an extremist  anti Arab racist party  Potential Blue and White coalition

opportunity  Typically  but not always  that opportunity goes to the leader of the party with the most votes  who then has 42 days to try  If that party leader fails  the president turns to another to attempt to create a coalition  So it could take a few months It also is possible that the Likud and the Blue and White coalition would join forces and create a national unity government  In theory  Mr

governing coalition in Israel  And some Israeli Arab voters have vowed to boycott the election  partly in protest of a new law pushed by Mr  Netanyahu declaring Israel as the  nation state of the Jewish people   Critics have called the law racist and undemocratic What about Palestinians in occupied territory They are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote in the election  About 4 75 million

Nevertheless  it could be affected Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law  who has been leading the administration s efforts to draft the plan  said it would not be made public until after the election Many Palestinians already have dismissed the plan   whatever it may contain   because they see Mr  Trump as siding with Israel  But the plan also faces a threat from the parties of the Israeli extreme right  which see any concessions to the Palestinians as unacceptable  If Mr  Netanyahu needs those parties to form a coalition  Mr  Trump s peace plan may be doomed However  if Blue and White wins or

PARIS   The moment of truth approached on Monday for President Emmanuel Macron s strategy for sucking the wind out of the Yellow Vest protest movement  as his prime minister presented the conclusions of a three month national consultation in which some 1 5 million French citizens let the government know what they wanted The answer  Lower taxes  in a country with the highest tax burden   46 percent of gross domestic product   of any developed nation  But where  and how  to do so  presents the French government with a tricky conundrum  The same citizens did not come out for any reduction in France s expansive social safety net or generous provision of public services Whether the government s formula for resolving the dilemma  which has yet to be determined  will be enough to satisfy the for now quiescent protest movement is uncertain  The Yellow Vests rejected the  Great National Debate  from the beginning  though the protest movement has hit its lowest ebb in numbers and public support Mr  Macron s subordinates insist that they have heard the message   We ve reached zero fiscal tolerance   Prime Minister douard Philippe told an audience of officials at the Grand Palais in Paris Monday  presenting the conclusions of the project  We ve got to lower taxes   Mr  Philippe said   There is an immense fiscal exasperation  It is now up to Mr  Macron himself to find concrete measures to translate the citizens  demands in the coming weeks  The Yellow Vest protest itself began as an uprising over a raise in gas taxes  which Mr  Macron rescinded soon after Mr  Macron came up with the  Great National Debate  idea as the Yellow Vest demonstrators were wreaking havoc in French cities  smashing in store windows and prompting some in the president s own circle to fear for his future  Half in desperation  he reached for a surefire national sedative  Let the French talk it out Local talk fests  spearheaded by the president himself  aired citizen grievances  with the hope of stifling a principal Yellow Vest complaint  that the French were not being heard  Plenty now have been  though how representative the talkers were has itself become a matter of debate ImagePrime Minister douard Philippe  second from right  delivered the findings of France s  Great National Debate  in Paris on Monday CreditPhilippe Lopez Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMany of those who attended around 10 000 local debates were elderly or retired  in a country where the retirement age is a mere 62  and there are many  many citizens with lots of time on their hands But the endless hours of meeting with local officials  often with  Mr  Macron doing most of talking  may have more successfully bludgeoned the Yellow Vests into submission than any number of riot police Only 22 300 people marched in the Yellow Vest protest across France Saturday  the lowest turnout yet  and less than a tenth of those who took part in the first marches on Nov  17 last year  And only about 35 percent of the French still support them  less than half the figure at the movement s peak Mr  Macron  by going week after week deep into the country and standing for hours on end lecturing and taking questions  has clawed back some of the popularity he lost at the height of the Yellow Vest movement He is now supported by some 29 percent of the French  according to an IFOP poll last week  around his level of support at the beginning of the protests  After weeks of trailing Marine Le Pen s far right Rassemblement National party  formerly the National Front  in polls for May s elections to the European Parliament  Mr  Macron has finally crept out in front  Renewing dialogue and deflating the anger   in one sense  he s succeeded   said Chlo Morin  a public opinion expert at the Ipsos consultancy in Paris   But  it was just one part of the French  who participated in the  Great National Debate   said Ms  Morin  It was a certain category of the population  and not necessarily a representative one  city dwellers  those who are reasonably off  So  it s been a relative success   she said   He s managed to regain his base of popularity   with his electorate  and with the right  But the large segment of the population that once identified with the Yellow Vests is another matter  I have a fear that whatever decisions Emmanuel Macron takes  even if they are strong ones  that knowing the Yellow Vests as I do  there is a kind of suicidal tendency  a tendency to say   All politicians are rotten    said Sonia Krimi  a 36 year old member of Parliament in Mr  Macron s party

president  and she has in the past expressed sympathy for the protesters  It s like two parallel lines   she said  referring to the government and the Yellow Vests   and the lines never join  Others also expressed concerns about the representativeness of the government s sample  The problem is  who actually came to the debates  in relation to those we never hear from   asked Jean Michel Clment  a parliamentarian who left Mr  Macron s party last year   It was people who were already in the know  Those who weren t either didn t come or didn t talk  Whatever the source  the government insisted it has heard   We ve gotten the message loud and clear   Mr  Philippe  the prime minister  said at the Grand Palais Monday The  message  as received by Mr  Philippe translated into a series of abstractions that could be difficult to translate into concrete policy  He said the French who took part had also expressed concerns about  isolation  abandonment and indifference  from public officials  about having  a democracy that is more representative and efficient   and about climate change  As for the conclusions that are to be drawn  I m waiting to hear them   said Mr  Clment   We re faced with some contradictions  We re hearing less taxes on one side  and on the other more public services  So its going to be a complicated equation   he said   A delicate exercise  On the streets of Paris there was skepticism all around  as there often is   The Great National Debate won t put an end to anything   said Marc Flandrin  48  a butcher in the suburb of Alfortville   Soon it will be the turn of the retired people to demonstrate  I think that in September it is going to get worse  Marc Denis  a 51 year old auditor for the national railway company  the S N C F   approved of the debate  but wondered whether it would change anything   I don t think the Yellow Vest movement will end   he said   It is now rooted in France  Ms  Krimi  the parliamentarian  said   It s too early to talk of success or failure   It s a complex situation  and it needs a complex response   she said   There has to be a political vision  People are sick of politicians and their promises   

WASHINGTON   For President Trump  a threat is frequently his first impulse He is forceful  declarative and speaks with unvarnished conviction  He has made the theme of promises made  promises kept the anthem of his re election effort But his threats often remain just that  The most recent example was when Mr  Trump backed down from a vow to close the border with Mexico  instead saying he would give one of the United States  most essential trading partners a year to deal with the migrant crisis  This came only a day after he had threatened to act if Congress did not bend to his will on the issue  The price of Mexican avocados spiked  but the government of Mexico seemed unmoved  Mr  Trump has warned Mexico of an impending border closing at least three times before  in October  November and December  On Friday  before leaving for a trip to the border town of Calexico  Calif   Mr  Trump suggested that his threat against Mexico was still in his holster   I never changed my mind at all  I may shut it down at some point  but I d rather do tariffs   he said Here is a look at some of Mr  Trump s more high profile threats Closing the border with MexicoIn retreating from his threat to close the border  Mr  Trump was withdrawing the warning that he issued strongly last week  But on Friday  he offered up another one  He said that the trade deal that the United States had reached with Mexico and Canada  known as the U S M C A   would not apply if Mexico does not stop Central American migrants from illegally entering the United States  If for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from  the U S  will be forced to Tariff at 25  all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us  If that doesn t work  which it will  I will close the Border   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter  This will supersede USMCA   Mr  Trump added  He also threatened an  economic penalty  on Mexico  for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border  Congress has not yet voted on the trade deal  If it does approve the pact   and the president tried to unilaterally abrogate selective provisions of the agreement   it would provoke numerous legal challenges  as well as an uproar from foreign leaders and members of Congress A bullhorn to RussiaThe president warned Russia in March to  get out  of Venezuela after Moscow dispatched military personnel to the country and offered to send the government of President Nicols Maduro shipments of food and medicine  He has consistently said that Mr  Maduro must step down and has strongly suggested that United States military intervention was on the table  He also urged the Venezuelan military to rebel  None of those threats have been effective  Mr  Trump has accused the Russian government of bolstering Mr  Maduro while the United States has been rallying support behind Juan Guaid  the opposition leader While the United States issued another round of sanctions and visa restrictions last month  Russia has shown no outward signs of backing down  and Mr  Maduro has refused Mr  Trump s calls that he resign Telling General Motors to reopen a plant  or else  he would cut subsidies Mr  Trump has frequently threatened companies  particularly if they were moving jobs overseas  He has directed some of his sharpest language toward General Motors  and Mary Barra  its chief executive  He has demanded that G M  reopen a plant in Lordstown  Ohio  that the company said it closed because consumer demand had shifted away from the smaller vehicles produced at the plant  He had earlier threatened to cut subsidies for the company and to recoup federal money it had received from the bailout at the height of the financial crisis of 2008 The company has not acceded to his demands  and so far has not suffered any penalty from the government Threats against the mediaBeyond regular Twitter posts denouncing the  fake news   Mr  Trump has also threatened to take regulatory and legal actions against news outlets and television programs In October 2017  Mr  Trump suggested that he would revoke NBC s broadcast license after the network published a report he objected to   only to be indirectly refuted days later by Ajit Pai  the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  who said that his agency  does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content   Nonetheless  Mr  Trump revived the threat in September 2018 One program on the network in particular has drawn the president s ire   Saturday Night Live   which Mr  Trump has said  should be tested in courts   investigated by the F C C   or   rather vaguely    should be looked into  In the fall  after the White House suspended the credentials of Jim Acosta  the chief White House correspondent for CNN  Mr  Trump threatened retaliation against other reporters if they did not  treat the White House with respect  Mr  Acosta s press badge was restored and no other White House reporters have had their credentials suspended since Trying to overturn a constitutional rightMr  Trump also threatened in 2018  to end birthright citizenship  a constitutional guarantee that could only be undone by amending the Constitution  In an interview with Axios at the time  the president called the concept  ridiculous  and said  it has to end  After strong pushback from within his party    Paul D  Ryan  the House speaker at the time  said the president  obviously  could not terminate a constitutional right by executive order   Mr  Trump retreated California on his mindThe liberal state has drawn Mr  Trump s displeasure   and Twitter threats   several times during his presidency In November  Mr  Trump blamed wildfires ravaging California on what he deemed  gross mismanagement of the forests   warning the state to  remedy now  or no more Fed payments    The criticism was misleading  as the majority of California s forests are federally managed  and the causes of wildfires are complicated and include climate change  Two months later  in January  Mr  Trump said that state officials had not made adequate remedy and reissued his threat   Unless they get their act together  which is unlikely  I have ordered FEMA to send no more money   referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency The state scrambled to make sense of Mr  Trump s renewed threat  and lawmakers from both parties criticized the move  A month later  a spokesman for FEMA told BuzzFeed it had never received a directive The agency continued to provide assistance to residents affected by the fire  On the same day that Mr  Trump delivered his second warning  FEMA extended the deadline for California residents to apply for disaster assistance to  Feb  15   It had been Jan  31   Federal cost sharing for debris removal actually increased to 90 percent from 75  percent  and the agency provided more than  347 million in grants and loans to affected residents A veiled warning to James B  ComeyAfter he fired James B  Comey  the former F B I  director  in May 2017  Mr  Trump urged him to think twice about speaking with reporters and referred to secret recordings of their conversations  James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter For weeks  Mr  Trump and his aides refused to confirm or deny the existence of such recordings or to clarify if he was simply rebutting Mr  Comey s claims that he had been asked by the president to pledge his loyalty Mr  Comey testified before Congress in June  telling lawmakers   Lordy  I hope there are tapes  Mr  Trump then cleared it up himself on Twitter  denying that he had taped Mr  Comey in the first place   I have no idea whether there are  tapes  or recordings of my conversations with James Comey  but I did not make  and do not have  any such recordings   

TIANJIN  China   At a port in Germany  150 Steinway pianos are waiting to be shipped to this gateway city for the grand opening of the Juilliard School s second campus  The air in Tianjin is so dry that the pianos will require climate controlled rooms  helping to nearly double the cost of the state of the art campus to  225 million The extra money is not coming from Juilliard  The local government is footing the bill  And that could become a problem for officials struggling with debt after an epic spending spree to develop a new commercial center from scratch Welcome to Yujiapu Financial District  which promotes itself as China s Manhattan  but may better be seen as a monument to the breakdown of the Chinese growth model  Four fifths of the office space stands empty  Construction on other buildings has stopped  leaving skeletons in the sky  A sprawling mall has few shoppers  Inside  a pet store has no animals  The businesses and residents that local officials had hoped to attract have yet to show up  Juilliard  which is expected to draw in students and their families  will open its doors next fall  a rare Western institution taking a chance on this district Zhang Zhiyi works as a recruiter for an online education company in a nearby office building  The lonely landscape has translated into a good deal for commercial renters  New tenants get a full year rent free  Deals abound  the 28 year old said   The other buildings aren t really full  either  Chinese local governments are swimming in debt  By official accounts  that debt totals  4 5 trillion  By unofficial estimates  it could be as large as  10 trillion  No one knows for sure because much of the borrowing for projects like the Tianjin Juilliard campus is rarely disclosed China has long borrowed heavily to build and then counted on breakneck economic growth to pay it back  The script  Sell vast amounts of land to developers  borrow to subsidize construction  and jobs and new cities will result  It was a model that helped China build its skyscrapers and high speed rail lines and ushered in an era of prosperity But China is not growing as fast as it used to  and it is not clear that the  build it and they will come  model will save Yujiapu and other places with big debts  The national government now must find other ways to spur growth   without making the debt problem worse ImageThe construction site of the Juilliard School in Yujiapu  The campus will open its doors next fall  the rare Western institution taking a chance on this district CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York Times China s economy has depended on building for the future  and there are considerable signs that they have overbuilt   said Logan Wright  director of China research at Rhodium Group  a consulting firm  adding that debt and overcapacity could hold back growth  That probably means much slower economic growth in the next decade compared to China s recent path   he said  Tianjin government officials did not respond to a request for comment  Tianjin  a coastal city just a short train ride from Beijing  had one of the highest growth rates in China  Its success made headlines  and local officials credited  Tianjin spirit  Tianjin speed and Tianjin benefits   Then the economy slowed  And local officials in the Binhai New Area  a special economic zone of Tianjin that includes Yujiapu  admitted they overstated growth  They slashed  50 billion from its original figure for 2016  bringing economic output to  100 billion  Today  Tianjin is one of the slowest growing regions of China and one of the most financially troubled  By the broadest measure of borrowing in China  called total social financing  Tianjin s government  corporations and households owe more than  760 billion  according to an estimate by Rhodium Group  The annual interest owed by all borrowers in Tianjin totaled 12 times its annual nominal economic growth  Rhodium said  citing the most recent numbers ImageAn empty underground shopping mall in Yujiapu CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesIf Yujiapu really is the Manhattan of China  it has a way to go to catch up to the real thing  Its avenues  some nearly as wide as Broadway  are eerily quiet  Many buildings just a few blocks from the Tianjin Juilliard School remain unfinished  The finished ones are mostly empty On one recent weekday visit  the door to the sales office for a hulking  unfinished residential building several blocks from the Juilliard campus blew open in the wind  No one was inside  Many of the six lane roads in the city lack crosswalk lights  in part because they are not needed  Across the Hai River from Yujiapu is another ghostlike district  Xiangluowan  where the local government encouraged private Chinese developers to build on their own dime  They did  but no one came  Dozens of the buildings in this district are now collateral for huge overdue loans that are being held by local banks ImageZhang Zhiyi  a recruiter for an online education company  said the lonely landscape in Tianjin had translated into good deals for commercial renters   The other buildings aren t really full  either   he said  CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesFor now  Tianjin can continue to borrow for projects like the Juilliard campus because it has a powerful patron in Beijing  said Victor Shih  an associate professor at the University of California  San Diego  and an expert on the Chinese economy  That official  He Lifeng  was once the No  2 Communist Party official in Tianjin  Mr  He now heads the central government agency that approves all major development projects  meaning he can authorize banks to lend more money to Tianjin   If the political will collapses for the Binhai area  then the bank loans will begin to dry up and the whole area is in trouble   Mr  Shih said Officials at the National Development and Reform Commission  the agency where Mr  He works  did not respond to a request for comment ImageIt s quiet in the Yujiapu Financial District  which promotes itself as China s Manhattan  Businesses that local officials hoped to attract have yet to show up  CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesDespite the empty buildings  the local government keeps borrowing  Last year  Tianjin and entities related to the local government raised  36 billion through new loans  according to data from the People s Bank of China  the country s central bank  Many residents believe Yujiapu s problems have been overstated and try to cast its emptiness in a positive light  Mr  Zhang  who works for the online recruiter  said technology companies looking for alternatives to expensive places like Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen could find Tianjin attractive   Now  there are quite a lot of internet companies  including some e commerce platforms   he said  speculating that these companies could move into his building in the future Michael Hart  a real estate consultant in Tianjin  said a resurgence of growth could save the city from its problems  It s like going to see a five act play   Mr  Hart said  referring to Yujiapu s critics   and you re halfway through Act 1 and calling it a lousy play  For Alexander Brose  the chief executive of the Tianjin Juilliard School  the district will soon benefit from the prestige of the Juilliard name to attract people  On a recent day  he toured the construction site  pointing to what he expected to see next year  Here  a 687 seat concert hall  he said  Over there  a recital space that can hold 299 people  And in the corner  a 250 seat black box theater  He paused  looking at the hundreds of construction workers welding  hammering and moving steel  and said  referring to the local government   I think they are looking at this as a feather in the cap of this new project   

KIRYAT GAT  Israel   The surprise candidate shaking up the last days of the campaign before Israelis head to the polls on Tuesday is a far right nationalist libertarian who advocates small government  legalizing marijuana and a free market economy While the candidate  Moshe Feiglin  the leader of the Zehut party  remains on the fringes in the election  his message is attracting enough young and disaffected voters that he could emerge as kingmaker in a close race between the two main contenders  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz  a former army chief  Under Israel s parliamentary system  even a few seats could be enough to give one side or the other a majority coalition While the pro marijuana stance has received some notice  it is his economic message that is resonating with young voters who are fed up with Israel s same old politics and exorbitant cost of living  I don t smoke   said Dor Thaler  24  who runs an e commerce business and was attending a recent town hall meeting in Kiryat Gat  a working class town in southern Israel   But I like everything else about his platform  An iconoclastic pied piper  Mr  Feiglin  56  is pledging to upend the customs and tax system by introducing a flat tax and gradually eliminating import duties and quotas  He wants to privatize hospitals and dismantle the state monopoly over land distribution  which he says will create affordable housing  Read our guide to the Israeli elections  His political agenda tends toward an extreme nationalism that critics call dangerous  He advocates a one state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  that would be one Jewish state  and the takeover by Israel s rabbinical authorities of Jerusalem s most contested holy site   the sacred compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary  He also proposes eventually rebuilding the Jewish temple there ImageThe Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem  part of what Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and what Jews refer to as the Temple Mount  Mr  Feiglin has called for Israel s rabbinical authorities to take over the site CreditUriel Sinai for The New York TimesHis platform  published as a 355 page book  titled  To Be a Free Jew  Operating Manual for the State of Israel   topped the nonfiction best seller list of a major Israeli book chain in late March At the town hall meeting in a dingy synagogue annex in Kiryat Gat he swept into the room to the chorus of a popular Israeli hit   He Who Believes Does Not Fear   There is a revolution here  a true revolution   Mr  Feiglin said   It s so different   he said  that young people are drawn to it  like butterflies to the light  Referring to the Palestinians as  tribes  Arabs or whatever   he said Israel had lost its most important weapon  the justice of its cause  By endorsing a two state solution that envisages a Palestinian state alongside Israel  he told his audience   You have turned yourself into a colonialist and an invader in your own country  His alternative  Impose Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank and Gaza  provide assistance to Palestinians who want to emigrate  and grant permanent resident status to those who remain if they pledge allegiance to the Jewish state Critics view his agenda as a crazy hodgepodge of ideas bordering on the anarchic and Messianic  There isn t enough space to fully describe Feiglin s right wing  ultranationalist and dangerous vision   the liberal Haaretz newspaper warned in an editorial this week titled   Joints on the Temple Mount  ImageMr  Feiglin  right

and received wide coverage in the mainstream news media  Two days later  he went on a bar crawl in a trendy area of downtown West Jerusalem  Appearing unannounced  he received a warm welcome in one establishment but was jeered at another In a pallid parade of establishment politicians Mr  Feiglin stands out as a colorful  convention busting alternative  said Batia Siebzehner  a sociologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  Today the elections are not about a worldview or political view  but about personalities   Ms  Siebzehner said She described him as  a bit of a clown  and  a bit of a hippie   but an extremist nonetheless  The somewhat Messianic vision of being on Temple Mount   I don t think the young Israelis understand the consequences   she said   It s a type of a gimmick  It s a kind of revolt  a revolt against everything  Recent polls predict that Mr  Feiglin s party could win from four to seven seats in the 120 seat Parliament  If the election is close enough  his bloc could determine who leads the next government ImageMr  Feiglin s campaign platform  published as a book titled  To Be a Free Jew  Operating Manual for the State of Israel   is a best seller in Israel CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesMr  Netanyahu  who is facing corruption charges and battling for his political survival after a decade in power  is polling neck and neck with Mr  Gantz Mr  Feiglin has said he is willing to join whichever coalition makes him the best offer He is demanding the legalization of cannabis  the post of finance minister and  if his party wins enough votes  the education ministry too Mr  Feiglin has long been in the public eye as a far right activist and leader of the  This Is Our Land  movement  In the 1990s  he was sentenced to six months in prison for sedition after protesters blocked roads throughout the country to try halt the Oslo peace process  In 2000  he joined Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and failed in four bids to become party chairman  He was elected to Parliament in 2013 and served a two year term  Israeli politics isn t subtle  Read about how from the far left to the far right  political ads are aimed at riling up the base  He has long lobbied for the wider availability of medical cannabis and has spoken of how his wife uses the drug to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson s disease  He now advocates freeing all cannabis from state control Israel partly decriminalized recreational use of marijuana in a law that took effect this week  imposing fines for possession but opening criminal proceedings only after a fourth offense  Cannabis promoters say that is not enough But legalization did not even come up in the Kiryat Gat meeting Mr  Feiglin talked about the high prices of groceries  his plans for breaking what he calls the state land cartel  and the Oslo accords  which he wants to abrogate  People think it s all about legalization   he said in a brief interview on his way out of the hall   It s not  It s about all the rest   

LONDON   Some British citizens planning to travel abroad already have a tangible sign of what life will look like once the country is no longer a member of the European Union  new passports missing  European Union  on the front cover Last month  even as lawmakers wrestled over the principal terms of the withdrawal process known as Brexit  the Home Office said that the design of new passports would change after March 29  the initial date set for Britain s departure For a while  both the old and new designs will be made and both are valid for travel  the Home Office said  adding   You will not be able to choose whether you get a passport that includes the words European Union or a passport that does not  While Brexit itself has been delayed   the original departure deadline was extended to April 12  and Prime Minister Theresa May has asked Brussels for a further postponement   the passport changes have moved forward as planned One early recipient  Susan Hindle Barone  posted images of her new and old British passports on Twitter on Friday  asking others to  spot the difference  Both passports have burgundy covers dominated by a golden coat of arms  But on one  the words  European Union  were missing from the top  Truly appalled   Ms  Hindle Barone wrote   I didn t notice it until I looked at them next to each other  It makes me feel sick  In an email on Saturday  Ms  Hindle Barone  a supporter of remaining in the European Union wrote   I was just shocked and dismayed to see the change to the passport as we haven t left the E U  yet  It s not the passport itself  but what the changes symbolize   something which I believe to be completely futile  What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union A Home Office spokeswoman told the BBC that  in order to use leftover stock and achieve best value to the taxpayer   British passports with  European Union  will still be issued for  a short period  Among the chief uncertainties surrounding Brexit was how traveling to Europe would change  depending on whether Britain reached a deal with the bloc  In posters on public transport and the internet  the government has warned people to renew their passports early if they planned to travel as the Brexit process was unfolding Drivers who held pink plastic permits under European Union standards were told to get ready to apply for international licenses in case Britain left without a deal  Here is what a no deal Brexit would look like  But for Britons  whose passports sometimes are their only form of identification  the document has come to symbolize Brexit  When the government announced that it would return to the old blue passports after Brexit  hailed by Mrs  May  who supported remaining in the bloc  as  an expression of independence   those in favor of the withdrawal saw a strong sign of their country reclaiming control Their joy was soon tempered by news that the documents would most likely be manufactured in France The symbolism of seemingly mundane documents is not limited to passports  In 2015  a year after Scotland voted not to declare independence from the United Kingdom  the government placed the British flag on driving licenses issued in England  Scotland and Wales in a bid to foster national unity  Driver s licenses are handled differently in Northern Ireland   The transport minister at the time  Tariq Ahmad  described the addition as  a true celebration of one nation Britain  The European Union requires its members to make passports with certain security elements  but it does not mandate a uniform design  Nearly all 28 member countries have adopted the recommended layout  the name of the bloc on top  followed by the name of the country  a coat of arms and the word  passport   with translations of information on the cover in all 24 official languages inside Only Croatia  which joined the bloc in 2013  has continued to issue a dark blue passport Britain first issued blue passports in 1921  It had 32 pages and was written in French  according to the Home Office  Passports carried the signature of the foreign secretary until 1947  The covers were changed to burgundy in 1988 to align with Britain s European partners Britons eager to start using a blue passport will have to wait until at least the end of the year  when the government will begin phasing them in  But burgundy booklets will continue to be issued until early 2020  

On Thursday General Khalifa Hifter  the leader of eastern Libya militias  ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli  the capital  where the country s internationally backed Government of National Accord is led by Prime Minister Fayez al Sarraj Ghassan Salame  the United Nations envoy to Libya  had recently urged opposing Libyan factions to come together at a U N  brokered national conference in mid April to lay the groundwork for elections and pull Libya back from the brink  By ordering his forces toward Tripoli when U N  Secretary General Antnio Guterres was in the city to help organize the national conference  General Hifter has made his disdain for the peace efforts clear The septuagenarian commander  who is backed by the United Arab Emirates  France  Egypt  Russia and Saudi Arabia  was aiming to scuttle the conference in a brazen bid for power  But he has encountered more resistance than he expected Despite appeals from the United Nations for stronger American diplomatic engagement  especially to restrain meddling by General Hifter s foreign backers  the Trump administration has long been uninterested in Libya  Recently  it seems to be warming to General Hifter  according to foreign diplomats we have spoken with  Such support from the Trump administration aligns well with the White House s ties to General Hifter s backers in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh  and President Trump s preference for authoritarian leaders A former officer in Muammar el Qaddafi s army  General Hifter broke with the dictator in the 1980s and received C I A  support before fleeing to Virginia  where he lived for two decades  He returned to Libya shortly before the NATO intervention in 2011 hoping to lead the revolution against Colonel Qaddafi  Sidelined by the rebels  he re emerged in 2014  waging a battle against Islamists in the eastern city of Benghazi  After years of fighting  he gained control over eastern Libya  Then he set his sights on Tripoli In recent days  clashes have broken out around the capital between General Hifter s forces and militias loosely allied with Mr  Sarraj s government  The country is entering a state of civil war The United Arab Emirates and Egypt have provided military support to General Hifter s campaign  according to U N  investigators  He was further emboldened after meeting King Salman of Saudi Arabia in late March  These Arab states back the Libyan general because he has vowed to eliminate political Islamists they oppose from Libya  France has been another key supporter and has provided clandestine advisers to his forces  The continued interference of these powers has undermined the efforts of the United Nations to mediate a peaceful solution Although the United States has officially backed the Tripoli Government of National Accord  continued American ambivalence on Libya or  worse  active support for General Hifter  could push Libya into greater conflict  This disorder could strengthen the Islamic State  which carried out a spate of attacks in Libya last year It s not hard to see why the White House could be drawn to General Hifter  Libya has the largest oil reserves in Africa  and the Trump administration reportedly sees Libya s oil production as important in keeping global prices low  In the past year  General Hifter s forces have secured oil facilities in Libya s central and southern regions  boosting output  He has highlighted his role in fighting terrorists  garnering favor among parts of the American military and intelligence agencies  He allowed the C I A  to establish a base in the eastern city of Benghazi  which he controls General Hifter also has Libyan supporters  His promise to establish order has been welcomed by Libyans exhausted by years of chaos and outraged at the failings of the weak Government of National Accord Despite this allure  he does not serve American interests  Nor is he the national savior he purports to be  He claims to be eradicating militias and building a professional army  but his forces depend heavily on militias  some of whom have committed war crimes  His common labeling as an anti Islamist is belied by his backing of Salafist armed groups  But most alarming is his apparent disdain for electoral politics  He has said that Libya is  not ripe for democracy   The recent history of the Arab world shows that such absolutism is not a formula for stability In General Hifter s case  the danger of more conflict is made even worse by the fact that he is not as strong as he seems  For all his aspirations  the general is unlikely to fully unite or subdue the country s factions and militias  His rise to power could provoke resistance by groups that fear reprisals and a return to dictatorship To avoid an escalation  American diplomatic intervention is needed now  Many Libyans actually want more American involvement  In our conversations over the years  it is clear that the United States still retains credibility in Libya as a relatively honest broker  especially when compared with the Europeans and Arabs pursuing competing and narrow interests In the summer of 2018  when General Hifter s forces seized oil facilities in central Libya  American diplomats  working alongside the U N  envoy  prevented these vital assets from falling out of the control of the internationally recognized government in Tripoli In the current crisis  similar American resolve is needed again  The Trump administration should issue a public censure of General Hifter and press for sanctions   both its own and through the United Nations   against the general for subverting efforts at a peaceful settlement and violating Security Council resolutions  In the past  such punitive measures have been applied to other militia leaders who have attacked the capital  Beyond this  greater American diplomatic leadership is needed to shift European and Arab states from backing an authoritarian to supporting a more inclusive path The United States cannot solve all of Libya s manifold problems  but the next several weeks offer a crucial window  and decisive American diplomacy could make all the difference  Without it  Libya risks spiraling into wider violence Frederic Wehrey is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of  The Burning Shores  Inside the Battle for the New Libya   Jeffrey

With the election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a fourth consecutive term  Israel reached a fateful moment  Mr  Netanyahu has set a course that could end Palestinian chances for statehood  threaten Israel s democratic character and deepen the alienation between its right wing coalition government and a majority of American Jews  Mr  Netanyahu can still choose to try to repair the damage from an ugly campaign  During an election night celebration  he promised to be  the prime minister of all the citizens of Israel   We hope he will  although he has not governed that way up to now and has formed alliances with extreme right wing parties Benny Gantz  a centrist former military chief and Mr  Netanyahu s main rival  conceded defeat on Wednesday  paving the way for Mr  Netanyahu to become Israel s longest serving leader Still  forming a government is expected to take weeks of horse trading  In theory  a broad coalition based on Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and Mr  Gantz s Blue and White Party  formed only a few weeks ago with two other military chiefs  could be the best option  forcing Mr  Netanyahu to compromise on his extreme policies  But analysts say it s far more likely he will stitch together a coalition that depends on ultra Orthodox and ultranationalist parties  driving the government further to the right and worsening the country s political divide  One question hanging over Mr  Netanyahu s victory is his likely indictment on corruption charges involving donors and friendly media outlets  The scandal could cut short his tenure  On Mr  Netanyahu s watch  Israel has evolved into an economically vibrant  technologically innovative country that has improved ties to leading Arab states  even if the only peace agreements are still with Egypt and Jordan  and expanded a number of international relationships  including with Russia  China and India Israel also is strong enough  either by itself or with the United States  to defeat any enemy  Yet its people remain fearful  especially of Iran   And some Israelis are even fearful of their fellow citizens who are Arabs  Mr  Netanyahu successfully exploited these fears to his political advantage He has accelerated construction of thousands of new housing units for settlers in the West Bank and removed Arabs from their homes in East Jerusalem  steadily shrinking the land available for a Palestinian state In a desperate bid to secure re election  Mr  Netanyahu publicly aligned with a tiny party  Otzma Yehudit  or Jewish Power  led by followers of the extreme nationalist Meir Kahane  the Brooklyn born rabbi whose Kach party was outlawed in Israel in the 1980s and placed on the American list of terrorist groups in 1997  Otzma Yehudit advocates annexing the occupied territories  expelling  enemies    widely understood to mean Arabs   and seizing the Temple Mount  a move tantamount to declaring war on Islam  Once Mr  Netanyahu crossed this line  perhaps it should not have been surprising that days before the voting he went even further and said he would begin effectively annexing parts of the West Bank that are expected to be incorporated in any Palestinian state Standing behind him in all this has been Donald Trump  who inserted himself on behalf of an Israeli leader in ways no previous American president has  Mr  Trump moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv  recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  closed the consulate in East Jerusalem that is the link with the Palestinians  and sharply reduced humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians in an apparent attempt to force them to abandon their dreams of an independent state At a congressional hearing on Tuesday  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did what was once unthinkable   he refused to publicly recommit the United States to a two state solution and to say whether it opposes unilateral annexation of the West Bank In the process  the United States and Israel have upended decades of American policy  United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreements like the 1993 Oslo Accords  which said the borders of Israel and Palestine  the future of Jerusalem  security arrangements and the fate of Palestinian refugees would be negotiated by the two parties Under Mr  Netanyahu  Israel is on a trajectory to become what critics say will be an apartheid state like the former South Africa   a country in which Palestinians will eventually be a majority  but without the rights of citizens  That s not good for Israel  nor for the United States Ami Ayalon  a former head of Shin Bet  Israel s internal security service  says his country refuses to confront a basic dilemma about what it wants to be in 40 years  He told The Times that the war most Israelis think they are fighting   over the recognition  sovereignty and security of their state   was actually won decades ago  The war now being fought is over expanding Israel s eastern border by building more settlements and demanding a Palestinian state alongside Israel  We are doing everything in order to create a virtual reality in which Palestinians cannot exist   Mr  Ayalon said   It is not a just war   he added   It will be a catastrophe if we should win  It is the end of our Zionist dream  More commentary on Israel in The TimesOpinion   Thomas L  FriedmanBibi Trump and Donald NetanyahuApril 10  2019Opinion

LANSING  Mich    Bruising political fights are usual business in Becky Debowski s eighth grade social studies classroom  From a model Constitutional Convention to a bare knuckle debate in Congress over slavery  she regularly has students assume roles of partisans throughout American history  like Abraham Lincoln and John C  Calhoun After the exercises  the class comes back together to debate whether the nation lived up to what the state of Michigan calls  core democratic values   such as equality  liberty and diversity  For decades  the values have been the heart of the state learning standards in social studies  a doorstop of a document that guides what teachers of history  civics  economics and geography cover in their lesson plans  I m really proud of my students   Ms  Debowski said   They can handle the complexity   So she was angry last year when she learned of a proposed revision of the state standards  in which the word  democratic  was dropped from  core democratic values   and the use of the word  democracy  was reduced The changes were made after a group of prominent conservatives helped revise the standards  They drew attention to a long simmering debate over whether  republic  is a better term than  democracy  to describe the American form of government That the two sides in that tussle tend to fall along party lines  each preferring the term that resembles their party name  plays no small part in the debate  But members of the conservative group also brought to the table the argument that K 12 social studies should be based on a close  originalist reading of the United States  founding documents They contended that the curriculum ought to focus more on the nation s triumphs than its sins  And they pushed for revisions that eliminated  climate change    Roe v  Wade  and references to gay and lesbian civil rights After a local publication  Bridge Magazine  reported the changes  the backlash in this political swing state was intense  In response  the state brought a broader group of Michiganders into the process to redraft the standards  which will be presented to the State Board of Education on April 9  The board  an elected body with eight members  will then vote on whether to adopt the document  Social studies is not rocket science   said Jim Cameron  who led the committee s work   It s more difficult  Defining American ValuesThe United States  unlike many other developed nations  lacks a national curriculum that defines what students should know  Each of the 50 states can create its own learning standards These documents are closely examined  While schools can teach material not included in them  they shape the content in standardized tests  and many educators rely heavily on the standards as they craft lesson plans  Student teachers are trained to use them Activists have long seen influencing state standards as an effective way to shape the next generation of voters  In 2010  conservatives on the Texas State Board of Education removed the word  democracy  as a description of American government  prompting protests  Georgia has also debated the term  eventually settling  in 2016  on standards that use the phrase  representative democracy republic  The Michigan conservatives   who prefer  constitutional republic    say their arguments are historical  not partisan ImageThe kindergarten section of the new draft of the Michigan social studies standards  Previously  conservatives pushed for the nation to be called a  constitutional republic  founded on  core values   not  democratic values   The previous draft also used the term  roles of the citizen  instead of  civic participation   When you read Article IV  Section IV  it says you re guaranteed a republican form of government   said Patrick Colbeck  a Republican former state senator  citing the United States Constitution While the founders were indeed skeptical of direct democracy  mainstream historians  political scientists and legal scholars say that the United States is both a representative democracy and a republic   and that there is no contradiction between those terms A democracy is government by the people  who may rule either directly or indirectly  through elected representatives  A republic is a form of government in which the people s elected representatives make decisions Some of the country s political processes  like ballot referendums  are more democratic than others  like the Electoral College  Grappling with that complexity is key to understanding American government  according to social studies experts The Michigan Department of Education invited Mr  Colbeck to participate in the standards writing process after he submitted a 13 page critique of a 2015 draft of the document  Mr  Colbeck  a former aerospace engineer who became active in politics through the Tea Party movement  saw liberal bias throughout the standards Asked to name the influences on his view of American history  Mr  Colbeck cited Dinesh D Souza  the right wing commentator  and a radio talk show hosted by Levon R  Yuille  a pastor and anti abortion activist  I wanted to make sure there was a seat at the table for a conservative worldview   Mr  Colbeck said After the proposed revisions garnered local media attention  hundreds of people flocked to community meetings to voice their outrage about what they considered conservative bias  Thousands more registered their objections online Ms  Debowski  the eighth grade social studies teacher  was among those against replacing  democratic values  with  core values   She was capable  she said  of explaining the difference between party names and political concepts   It belittles my subject   she said Many of the students who protested were less worried about terminology than about the way the standards dealt with gender and race  Alex Hosey  a 16 year old high school sophomore in East Lansing  objected to what had been left out  such as any mention of redlining  which contributed to the racial segregation of Michigan cities  Hiding our nation s sins isn t the right way to do it   he wrote in a letter to the State Board of Education   Teach us about everything   the good and the bad  so we can learn to think for ourselves  ImagePatrick Colbeck  a Republican former state senator  participated in the standards writing process CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesImageMarsha Lewis  a Detroit assistant principal and a chairwoman of the bias review group CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesBack to the Drawing BoardUnder fire  the state education agency asked for volunteers to help rewrite the standards yet again   for the third time in five years Out of 144 people who applied  116 were selected  They included teachers  college professors  parents  students and retirees  They were placed on subcommittees dealing with every aspect of the document  from American history  civics and economics to  bias review   and sorted through thousands of pages of public comments They added depth to sections on indigenous peoples  history  Roe v  Wade  climate change and gay and lesbian rights were all restored  The bias review committee suggested the terms  enslaved people  or  enslaved Africans  instead of  slaves  The overall goal was that every Michigan student   a third of whom are nonwhite   would be able to  see themselves  in the social studies standards  said Marsha Lewis  a Detroit assistant principal and a chair of the bias review group But in the days before the document was to be sent to the State Board of Education  fundamental questions about how to describe American government and citizenship had not been resolved It was not just that some Democratic leaning committee members liked the term  democracy  while some Republican leaning members preferred  republic   The debate was really about bigger disagreements that transcended party lines  about how to deal with populism and protest  and about whether the United States is a unified entity of citizens or a conglomeration of groups divided by race  class  language and other identities On March 7  the heads of all the subcommittees gathered at the Historical Society of Michigan in Lansing to go through the draft one last time  The laptop screen of the head writer  a district social studies consultant named Dave Johnson  was projected onto the wall as he made last minute revisions in a Google document Should  responsible citizenship  be replaced with  civic participation   in an effort to include undocumented students Were elementary school students ready to learn about the right  stated in the Declaration of Independence  to  alter or abolish  a government  There s a treason clause in the U S  Constitution   said Michael Libbee  a professor of geography at Central Michigan University  It s only treason until it works   replied Ellen Zwarensteyn  executive director of the Michigan Center for Civic Education In the end   alter or abolish  was included  though the number of mentions was greatly reduced  The writers replaced many  but not all  instances of the word  citizenship  with  civic life  or  civic participation  After lunch  Mr  Cameron  the committee leader and a state education consultant  tacked to the walls poster pages of handwritten suggestions from African American and Asian American community groups Among their suggestions were to add references to Korematsu v  the United States  the Supreme Court case that allowed Japanese internment during World War II  They also asked for mentions of the Chinese Exclusion Act  the Flint water crisis  the  MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter Ms  Zwarensteyn took careful notes  Some of the most rigorous debates had occurred on the civics subcommittee she helped lead  where Michael Warren  a circuit court judge  was a strong conservative voice  Judge Warren preferred the term  first principles  to  democratic values   and had pushed for the civics standards to be based on a close reading of the founding documents ImageMichael Warren  a circuit court judge  was a strong conservative voice CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesImageEllen Zwarensteyn  executive director of the Michigan Center for Civic Education CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesThe list of core values that the standards writers eventually agreed on was  equality  liberty  justice and fairness  unalienable individual rights  including life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness   consent of governed  truth  common good  And after months of sometimes bitter debate  the group decided these values could still be called  democratic   As part of a compromise  the nation s political system would be referred to primarily as  American government   but also  in some instances   constitutional government  and   yes    democracy  Korematsu and the Flint water crisis made it into the standards  Redlining  the Chinese Exclusion Act   MeToo and Black Lives Matter did not  Neither did James Madison  to the consternation of Mr  Warren Mr  Colbeck  the former state senator who had helped write the previous draft  was displeased  Calling the nation a democracy was not  politically neutral and accurate   he said There will still be time for public comment and revision  Education officials plan to introduce the new standards in  listen and learn  meetings across the state this spring If the Board of Education  which after November s election went from a 4 4 partisan split to a 6 2 Democratic majority  votes to adopt the document  the state will begin training teachers on how to use the new standards Then  most likely in the next decade  policymakers will outline new priorities for Michigan schools  and they will ask educators and experts to rewrite the standards once again  The process of retelling the nation s history   deciding what gets left out and who is heard from   never ends  

The package of eccentric ideas known as modern monetary theory   for example  that annual deficits are too small  and that the United States can essentially print money to pay off its debt   has been on the receiving end of a remarkable level of vitriol In policy circles  heavyweight economists have churned out scathing attacks  In the business arena  titans like Laurence D  Fink and Bill Gates have labeled it  garbage  and  crazy talk   And in academia  when the University of Chicago s Booth School of Business asked top scholars about a couple of its claims  they split between the 28 percent who disagreed and the 72 percent who strongly disagreed But M M T   as it s known  is attracting a conspicuous number of fans in an unexpected place  Wall Street  Money managers  chief executives and business analysts maintain that the approach offers several important and overlooked insights  and far from finding it fanciful or deranged  they are using M M T  to build economic forecasts and even trading strategies  I don t look at labels in terms of what s on the left and the right   said Jan Hatzius  the chief economist at Goldman Sachs   I try to look at what makes me have a better chance of getting the forecast right  and I do find some of the ideas useful  So does Paul A  McCulley  a former chief economist at the behemoth asset firm Pimco  Ideas like M M T  that rub against the grain of conventional economics  he said  have  for all of my career been a very useful framework for analysis  That framework helped produce billion dollar gains for the company after the 2008 financial crisis  Dismissing alarms about outsize government debt and white knuckle interest rates  Pimco instead bet successfully that rates would remain low  When it came to decision making during this period  Mr  McCulley said  M M T  and other unorthodox approaches helped him  get it right  Richard C  Koo  chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo  said he had been telling his clients for years that  even with huge budget deficits in the U S   interest rates would actually come down  not go up  Wall Street is not immune to the herd mentality  but Mr  Koo and several other analysts argued that academic economists had a vested interest in certain theories and were  therefore  more likely to suffer from groupthink In an article posted on Wednesday on the website of Grantham  Mayo  Van Otterloo   Company  known as GMO  the strategist James Montier wrote   For me an economic approach must help me understand the world  and provide me with some useful insights  preferably about my day job   investing   On those measures  let me assure you that M M T  thrashes neoclassical economics  hands down  And Daniel Alpert  a managing partner of the investment bank Westwood Capital  credited the theory with preventing him from panicking that rates would soar when the Federal Reserve set off a brief  taper tantrum  in 2013 and announced it was easing its stimulus program Over the past couple of years  he said  the Fed tried everything    it did a belly dance to get long term interest rates up    and it didn t work M M T   Mr  Alpert said   successfully debunks 40 years of misassumptions of how markets and public credit work  Explaining M M T  s AppealProgressive politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York are among the most vocal supporters of M M T   but the theory s appeal crosses political lines in part because it offers a narrative for a series of events that the established wisdom failed to anticipate or explain Big government deficits  for instance  were supposed to mop up available pools of capital and drive up interest rates  which would  in turn  elbow out private investors  damage growth and feed inflation But the last decade was different  When deficits soared after the recession  interest rates fell and savings rates climbed  Investors are awash in capital  The economy has been expanding  slowly  for 10 years  with unemployment and inflation rates ensconced at record low levels One reason for the misjudgments may be that the economic models that confidently strode down the mainstream were hammered out in the decades after World War II  when American companies had an enormous appetite for capital investment   We don t live in that world anymore   said Mr  Koo of Nomura  Today  vast fortunes shift across oceans in an instant  currencies are untethered from gold  and your local coffee shop may no longer accept cash Technological advances  demographic shifts and persistently lower interest rates have further altered the global economy  Mohamed A  El Erian  chief economic adviser at the financial firm Allianz  wrote in an email that  modern monetary theory has merit in stimulating debate  on whether those changes provide  for governments to run larger economically sustainable deficits than was previously thought possible  Besides the risk of government deficits  M M T  throws out a drawerful of other venerable assumptions with Marie Kondo esque ruthlessness  To start  it instructs you to erase that textbook drawing of a white haired Uncle Sam collecting tax dollars from the public and then using them to pay for military weapons  highway repairs  federal workers  wages and more Tax revenues are not what finance the government s expenditures  argues Stephanie Kelton  an economist at Stony Brook University and one of the most influential modern monetary theorists  What actually happens in a country that controls its own currency  she says  is that the government first decides what it s going to spend  In the United States  Congress agrees on a budget  Then government agencies start handing out dollars to the public to pay for those tanks  earth movers and salaries  Afterward  it takes a portion back in the form of taxes  If the government takes back less than it gave out  there will be a deficit  The national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all of the dollars that were spent into the economy and not taxed back  and are currently being saved in the form of Treasury securities   Ms  Kelton said Ms  Kelton  a frequent speaker at business and financial conferences and the chief economic adviser to Mr  Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign  points out that every dollar the government spends translates into a dollar of income for someone else  So a deficit in the public sector simultaneously produces a surplus outside the government The reverse is also true  Ms  Kelton maintains  and that can lead to trouble  The seven biggest American depressions or downturns going back 200 years  she said  were all preceded by government surpluses Ms  Kelton complains that modern monetary theorists are often incorrectly described as contending that  deficits don t matter   Of course they matter  she said What she disagrees with is the reason given  In her view  deficits are not a sign of excessive spending or necessarily a forerunner of inflation  They can be too big  especially if they are not used to increase the nation s productive capacity  or if there is a shortage of labor  raw materials and factories  If Congress authorizes too much spending and businesses are not nimble enough  to absorb it  there can be bottlenecks and price pressure  she acknowledged But she argues that it is much more likely that deficits are too small  depriving the economy of critical investments  The best way to stabilize the economy and ensure full employment and a humming economy  she said  is to have the federal government guarantee every American a job The notion that surpluses could cause economic downturns flips conventional thinking  Yet the idea of sectoral balances   that government or nongovernment deficits are offset by surpluses on the other side   is what some financial economists find so illuminating  even if they stop short of endorsing all of the theory s tenets  It is a great way of summarizing whether households and firms are living beyond their means   said Mr  Hatzius of Goldman Sachs   It is a great indicator of potential financial crises  In his view  giant private sector deficits are much more alarming than public sector ones because households and companies are at much greater risk of losing access to credit in a downturn  Unlike the Treasury  they can t print money   or issue bonds   when they run out Mr  McCulley  now retired from Pimco  used the same kind of analysis to guide his investing decisions after the financial crisis  He figured the only way that private borrowers could shrink their vast storehouse of debt was to have the government buy up those assets  He was unconcerned that the federal deficit would balloon as a result Pimco s view during the crisis  he said  was  shake hands with the government   because it had the largest checkbook  That is why the firm invested heavily  for example  in the federally guaranteed mortgage backed securities that most other firms were shedding Mr  Koo of Nomura has further developed the idea of sectoral balances to explain the most recent wave of recessions and argue for larger government deficits  The problem that major economies in Japan  Europe and the United States have today  he said  is that despite low interest rates  investment opportunities in domestic markets don t offer sufficient returns to lure borrowers to go into debt  using the vast pools of available savings That means  the government has to spend money to keep the economy going   he said  And as long as the government invests in projects that produce an economic return greater than the yield on 10 year Treasury notes   currently about 2 5 percent    this will never be a burden on taxpayers  Ray Dalio  the founder of Bridgewater Associates  one of the world s largest hedge funds  made a similar point in a paper he released recently about saving capitalism  Without any specific reference to M M T   he noted that  policymakers pay too much attention to budgets relative to returns on investments  The View From St  CroixA couple of M M T  s academic strongholds are the University of Missouri Kansas City and the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College  And there  too  Wall Street s attraction to the theory has played a role Warren Mosler  a hedge fund mogul who resides in low tax St  Croix  helped bankroll some of the work at those schools  donating money for student scholarships and conferences Mr  Mosler developed some of the ideas underlying M M T  from his own observations of financial operations  and has written a couple of short treatises He is used to doubters   It s astounding   he said  How could the Fed chairman be wrong  he mused  and  somebody sitting in St  Croix in a pair of shorts be right  Ron Biscardi  chief executive of the investment firm Context Capital Partners  was one of those persuaded by the guy in shorts  When he read Mr  Mosler s book  the ideas struck him as both revolution and revelation Mr  Biscardi s company also runs conferences for the hedge fund industry to which he has invited Ms  Kelton as a speaker  He had recently returned from one at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach that featured tte  ttes between hundreds of investors and alternative asset managers and a keynote speech by Gary Cohn  the former director of the Trump administration s National Economic Council Mr  Biscardi described himself as a libertarian and conservative  To him  modern monetary theory means not only more government spending on infrastructure  but also lower taxes on the wealthy  After all  if government deficits can grow larger  there s no need to raise as much revenue To many mainstream economists  though  M M T  is a confused mishmash that proponents use to support their political objectives  whether big government programs like  Medicare for all  and the Green New Deal or smaller taxes  Think of the Mirror of Erised in the Harry Potter saga  which shows the heart s desire   a tantalizing prospect that ultimately brings ruin From this perspective  M M T  is a version of free lunchonomics  leaving the next generation to pay for this generation s profligacy Although several prominent mainstream economists have recently revised their thinking about the risks of large government debt  they continue to reject other tenets of M M T At some point  they insist  if the government just creates money to pay the bills  hyperinflation will kick in  The idea that deficits don t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong   the Federal Reserve chairman  Jerome H  Powell  testified before the Senate Banking Committee in February Reckoning With KeynesNarayana Kocherlakota  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 2009 to 2015  is aware of the conflicts between M M T  and the traditional framework developed by John Maynard Keynes  in which it is rooted But he is more struck by their similarities rather than their differences  Both recommend that government should spend when the private sector isn t doing enough to employ the nation s work force  raw materials and factories to prompt growth  Both deem inflation to be insidious The inflationary threat looms particularly large for economists of his generation  Mr  Kocherlakota  55  said  For them  the seminal experience was the scarring inflation of the 1970s   The big lesson was that resources are always scarce   he said But over the past decade  he said  his thinking has evolved  Now Mr  Kocherlakota is more inclined to believe that scarcity is not the overriding problem and that the federal government could spend more without risk of excessive inflation If you put aside the theoretical disputations  Mr  Kocherlakota said  the important question is  How far is the United States from reaching the limits of its capacity Even with a jobless rate under 4 percent  he believes there is room to maneuver Mr  Kocherlakota said that compared to those within the Fed  chief executives  financiers and analysts who operate internationally tend to be more open to modern monetary theory in their analyses of government deficits and inflation  Folks who take a global perspective are much more likely to see a lot of unused capacity   he said  They realize  inflation is not built at home anymore  it s built through global pressures  Mr  McCulley  the Pimco alumnus  would put his money on that  Increasing the deficit so that the government could invest in infrastructure and the labor force  would not make me bearish on the stock market at all   he said  At all   he repeated   If anything  it would make me bullish   

PHOLA  South Africa   President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa assumed power promising a  new dawn   But just over a year later  he can t keep the nation s lights on A month before a national election  the worst rolling blackouts in years are regularly plunging South Africans into the dark  With annoying frequency  warnings of  load shedding  pop up on cellphones  referring to the power cuts imposed to prevent a collapse of the national electricity grid Takeout dinners by candlelight are hastily arranged in the cities  Meals are prepared over coal braziers instead of electricity in places like Phola  a township in a region dotted with power plants  about 75 miles east of Johannesburg  South Africa s biggest city  You wake up and there s no hot water  You can t bathe  you can t iron   said Victoria Nkosi  48  a longtime resident of a government built house in Phola   Why is there load shedding when we re surrounded by power plants  The short answer is that the blackouts are the result of years of mismanagement and corruption in the state owned utility  Eskom  They are also evidence of how difficult it is for Mr  Ramaphosa to reform the nation s state enterprises and secure stable electricity for South Africa  sub Saharan Africa s most advanced economy ImageFrieda Madalane  who sells fried bread out of her home in Phola  lost everything in her refrigerator after a recent blackout CreditJoao Silva The New York TimesThe blackouts are contributing to another year of lackluster economic growth in South Africa  a deeply unequal society that desperately needs strong  sustained expansion to create the foundations of a post apartheid economy Every sector of the economy  from the mining giants and car dealers to big retailers and informal entrepreneurs  has been hit badly by the blackouts  Eskom  the state utility that produces about 95 percent of the nation s power  is now regarded as the biggest risk to South Africa s economy  according to the National Treasury and outside financial experts In Phola  Frieda Madalane  who is 54  wakes up just after midnight to start cooking fried dough bread  called vetkoek  Starting before dawn  she sells the bread outside her home to neighbors going to work  making about  20 a day But her profits are now reduced by the amount she spends for kerosene to fuel the lamp she uses during load shedding  And one time  there was load shedding for one full day and I lost everything in my refrigerator   Ms  Madalane said ImagePresident Cyril Ramaphosa  who promised a  new dawn   faces an election just as blackouts are battering the economy CreditKim Ludbrook EPA  via ShutterstockOn May 8  South Africans are scheduled to cast ballots in the sixth general election since the end of apartheid in 1994  The long governing African National Congress is expected to garner the most votes  but its margin of victory remains the biggest uncertainty A strong showing could give Mr  Ramaphosa a mandate to carry out reforms in his party and in government  his allies say  But a poor performance could lead to a continuing standoff between Mr  Ramaphosa and his party rivals  or even fuel an outright challenge  party officials and political analysts say Weeks after becoming party leader in late 2017  Mr  Ramaphosa forced out of power Jacob Zuma  who had more than a year left in his second term as South Africa s president  Mr  Ramaphosa  who had served as Mr  Zuma s deputy for four years  promised to root out corruption  particularly in state owned enterprises Mr  Ramaphosa quickly shook up Eskom s board and eventually appointed a highly respected minister to overhaul Eskom and other state enterprises As the nation s biggest state enterprise  Eskom was the biggest target for corrupt A N C  politicians  their business allies and civil servants during the Zuma years  according to ongoing public inquiries into state corruption ImageThe blackouts have hit every sector of South Africa s economy  the most advanced in sub Saharan Africa CreditSiphiwe Sibeko ReutersEskom was  the main theater where corruption  state capture was taking place   Jabu Mabuza  the chairman of Eskom s board  said during recent testimony at a government corruption inquiry South Africa was plunged back into darkness late last year  as Eskom began imposing load shedding for the first time in three years And the situation has become far more critical than in the Zuma years  So short of energy is Eskom that it has been forced to cut power at the height of summer in the southern hemisphere  and even on weekends when demand is lower because many companies are closed  The crisis peaked in recent weeks as Eskom imposed several consecutive days of  stage 4  load shedding   the highest level   and even talked of the need to create higher stages of cuts A main cause of the recent blackouts  experts say  is two new but underperforming coal fired megaplants  Years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget  the two plants had been expected to relieve stress from South Africa s aging power infrastructure But the plants  which have yet to be completed  are only partially operational because of frequent breakdowns   the result of shoddy construction  experts say  One recent morning  at the Kusile plant   only about 12 miles northwest of Phola   giant construction cranes hovered above three of the six generating units ImageMembers of the main opposition party  Democratic Alliance  protesting against the state owned utility Eskom in Pretoria last week CreditPhill Magakoe Agence France Presse   Getty Images Eskom has gotten itself in a situation where the plants have started to come online  and they just don t work   said Jesse Burton  an expert on electricity policy and coal at the University of Cape Town s Energy Research Center Established in 1923  Eskom provided electricity in the last few years of apartheid to about a third of South African households  a small percentage of them black  Now 90 percent of households have electricity  a result of policies by the A N C   which promised access to power as part of democratization At the same time  Eskom became the source of jobs and contracts for the politically connected  Its bloated work force increased by half between 2003 and 2017 Mr  Ramaphosa recently proposed a partial breakup of Eskom   dividing the company into generation  transmission and distribution businesses under one holding company  The split would make each entity more competitive  he said The breakup  experts said  would also reduce the potential for corruption and ease South Africa s transition away from coal ImageGiant construction cranes hovering above three of the Kusile plant s six generating units CreditJoao Silva The New York TimesA monopoly like Eskom can fuel corruption  said Lauren Hermanus  the founder of an energy consultancy  Adapt  But if you have more players  who are acting in a more transparent way  then you can limit some of that stuff   she said Though still rudimentary  Mr  Ramaphosa s proposal has caused a fierce and immediate backlash from inside the A N C  and the party s traditional allies  including the South African Communist Party and labor  Wary of losing jobs  the biggest union representing Eskom workers  the National Union of Mineworkers  has threatened to shut down the national grid in the days leading up to the election next month Mr  Ramaphosa expressed confidence that the blackouts would not hurt his party at the polls  The challenges Eskom faces emanated from our recent past  and many people are aware that there were a lot of wrong things that were being done in Eskom   he told the local news media But opinion was split in Phola Ms  Madalane  who sells fried bread out of her home  said she moved to Phola in the 1970s  By the time her first child was born in 1986  electricity had arrived in parts of the township The illegal hookups  she said  were putting stress on the national grid Ms  Madalane said she would vote for the A N C  and Mr  Ramaphosa next month  I m angry with Zuma  but Ramaphosa is still new in office   she said   Let s give him a chance  Maybe he ll fix it  Others  though

WARSAW   Growing up in a small city in southern Poland  part of a religious family and conservative community  Maciej Gosniowski was told again and again that something was wrong with him  It would be better if I changed myself   he recalled teachers telling him   It would be better if I behaved more like a boy  It would make my life easier  Mr  Gosniowski was beaten by other students who used homophobic slurs he did not yet understand  He does not want other young people to suffer as he did  so he welcomed the decision by the mayor of Warsaw to introduce a declaration last month aimed at promoting tolerance But the backlash to the declaration has left him shaken Poland s governing party  Law and Justice  has seized on the declaration and the issue of gay rights in its campaigning for European Union elections in May and for national elections this fall Where the party once attacked migrants as a threat to the soul of the country  gay people have become its public enemy No  1 in recent weeks ImageThe palace of Culture and Science  which hosts Warsaw s City Council  The mayor introduced a declaration last month aimed at promoting tolerance for the L G B T  community CreditAnna Liminowicz for The New York TimesIt is part of a growing trend across eastern and central Europe  where nationalist and populist parties are increasingly turning to cultural issues   and attacks on gay people   to rally their faithful From Romania  where the government tried and failed to change the Constitution to ban same sex marriage  to Hungary  where homosexuals are vilified as a threat to traditional families  the letters L G B T  are being scorned as part of a broader struggle against what the nationalists and populists call  European values  Jaroslaw Kaczynski  the leader of Law and Justice and the most powerful politician in Poland  used the party s convention in March to declare that this was a war Poland must win to survive  It comes down to  as we know today  sexualization of children from the earliest childhood   he said   We need to fight this  We need to defend the Polish family  We need to defend it furiously because it s a threat to civilization  not just for Poland but for the entire Europe  for the entire civilization that is based on Christianity  The party s rank and file have rallied to the call  I think that Poland will be a region free from L G B T    said Elzbieta Kruk  who is running on the party s list for a seat in the European Parliament   I hope it will be  Other groups have echoed the attacks  often in more extreme language Fans of one of the

month  the Rev  Henryk Grzadko warned those gathered that Poland was experiencing a  civilizational invasion   It comes down to them waving a rainbow flag and trying to steal our internal values like

the tolerance declaration  said that while he had expected a cynical response from the government  he worried about the sort of propaganda state outlets had produced It was the same kind of bile  he

painted this abysmal picture that we are going to be overrun by hundreds of thousands of migrants that are going to rape our women and introduce diseases into Poland  They are now doing exactly the same thing  But he does not think it will work  In 2015  when Law and Justice came to power  an overwhelming majority of Poles agreed with the idea that more needed to be done to secure Europe s borders from migrants That threat has largely passed  and the issue does not have the resonance it once did  according to a poll released this week by the European Council on Foreign Relations  While migration is important for some voters  it is not the only battleground for votes ahead of the European Parliament elections   the group said in a statement Mr  Trzaskowski  the Warsaw mayor  said he did not believe attacking gay people would prove as effective as the campaign against migrants  The majority of the Polish people will not buy the idea that homosexuals endanger our culture or values

couples  with only 18 percent support Oktawiusz Chrzanowski  36  who played a key role in helping draft the Warsaw declaration  and his partner  Hubert Sobecki  said one of the most insidious parts of the government campaign was an effort to paint homosexuality as a danger to children  The most shocking and disgusting thing is how they can claim people in the L G B T  community are pedophiles   Mr  Sobecki said The Warsaw declaration calls for sex education in schools that follows guidelines set out by the World Health Organization  and for a shelter in the city for people cast out by their family and community ImageMr  Gosniowski  left  preparing costumes for a performance  He decided to come out not long after he was beaten in high school and works as one of only a handful of drag

nonconformity can still come at a cost Young people often ask him about coming out safely  I feel I am needed here   he said   People here are scared to walk hand in hand in the street  While the vitriol being directed at gays is alarming  he said  he has also noticed an outpouring of support that surprised him  The two wings of society seem to be spreading apart   he said   I have found more support than ever  But also people who are more hateful than ever   

SO PAULO  Brazil   A little more than a year ago  a member of Rio de Janeiro s City Council was murdered with four shots to the head and neck  The councilwoman  Marielle Franco  was headed home from an event when a car pulled up and someone opened fire  killing her and her driver  It was obvious from the beginning that this was a premeditated  professional assassination  Ms  Franco was a black  feminist L G B T  activist  a fierce human rights defender who wasn t afraid to take on sensitive issues  the use of state violence in favelas  for instance  or the involvement of police and politicians in Rio s paramilitary groups There was finally a breakthrough in the case  last month  when the state police arrested two suspects  Unsurprisingly enough  they were former military police officers  The alleged shooter  Ronnie Lessa  had retired from the force after being injured in a car bomb attack  according to investigators  he then took a job as a contract killer and gun runner for one of the most powerful militias in Rio de Janeiro  called the Escritrio do Crime  or Crime Bureau  The other suspect  lcio Vieira de Queiroz  who might have acted as a getaway driver  had been expelled from the police force under suspicion of providing security for an illegal gambling house   Both men deny involvement in the murders  ImageInvestigators say Ronnie Lessa  suspected in the murder of Marielle Franco  has ties to Brazil s president CreditLucas Landau ReutersBut who ordered the assassination  That s where things get messy  So messy that last year  the federal police began an inquiry into the local murder investigation  after allegations that it had been systematically obstructed by militia members  public officials and politicians  Last November  Brazil s public security minister at the time said that it s  more than a certainty  that powerful people are involved in the murder  Some say  half jokingly  that it might be easier to pinpoint who is not involved By now the federal task force has searched the residences of a former state representative  a former civil policeman  a former federal agent and an active duty federal police official  Even the current president of Brazil  Jair Bolsonaro  has come under public scrutiny for his ties to both of the suspects in the killing  He and Mr  Lessa were neighbors in a luxury seaside condominium in Rio de Janeiro  and his youngest son once dated Mr  Lessa s daughter  There is also a picture of Mr  Bolsonaro posing alongside Mr  Queiroz   The president has denied knowing the men  But these could be just coincidences  More troubling is the outspoken sympathy of the president and his family for the paramilitaries The infamous  milcias   in their current form  were established in Rio de Janeiro s favelas in the late 1990s and early 2000s  under the pretext of protecting residents from drug traffickers  They are mainly formed of active duty and retired police officers who assume control of the communities and extort money from ordinary citizens and shopkeepers  A 2013 academic report concluded that of the roughly 1 000 favelas in the city  45 percent are controlled by militia organizations and 37 percent by drug gangs During his 27 years as a congressman  Jair Bolsonaro repeatedly supported death squads and militias  In 2003  he said   As long as the state does not have the courage to adopt the death penalty  those death squads  in my opinion  are very welcome   In a 2008 interview  the future president of Brazil declared that the government should support militias and potentially legalize them  since they  offer security and in this way they can maintain order and discipline in their communities  It runs in the family  apparently  Mr  Bolsonaro s eldest son  the senator Flvio Bolsonaro  was recently revealed to have connections to a former military police captain  Adriano Magalhes da Nbrega  the purported head of the Crime Bureau   The ex police officer is now a fugitive from justice   Both Mr  Nbrega s mother and wife were employed for years in Flvio Bolsonaro s office when he was a Rio de Janeiro State lawmaker  In a news release  Senator Bolsonaro claimed that the women were hired by someone else and that he was the victim of a smear campaign  But he also praised Mr  Nbrega twice in Rio s Legislative Assembly for his work as a police officer  awarding him the highest honor granted by the assembly   the Tiradentes Medal   while he was still in jail on a homicide conviction   The murder victim was a favela resident who had just denounced crimes of torture and extortion allegedly committed by his police squad   Incidentally  when Mr  Nbrega was found guilty and sentenced to 19 years in prison  Jair Bolsonaro  too  came to his defense in the Congress  saying he was a  brilliant officer  and demanding a review of the conviction   Mr  Nbrega was eventually acquitted on appeal  In 2015  Flvio Bolsonaro was the only legislator to vote against the establishment of a parliamentary commission to investigate frauds in  autos de resistncia    killings on the part of the police that are reported as having occurred in self defense  He argued that the investigation would put a  knife in the throat  of police officers  who already do not have legal security to carry out their work  In 2008  he spoke of the  happiness  of the people  residing in these communities  supposedly dominated by militiamen   Finally  last year  he was the only legislator to vote against awarding the Tiradentes Medal   that same honor he once gave to a purported militia leader   to Marielle Franco ImageThe police say these rifles were found at an address linked to Mr  Lessa  a former police officer CreditCivil Police  via Associated PressWhich brings us back to her assassination  Bank records have showed a cash deposit of 100 000 reais  about  25 000  into the alleged shooter s account  Who ordered the crime  And why  How widespread is the influence of paramilitary gangs in Brazil s police force and politics Those questions are met with silence while the country remains one of the deadliest places for human rights defenders in the world  Many cases are never solved  Most of them seem to be quickly forgotten  The situation looks poised to get only worse  since our new president loathes the concept of human rights  in a 2016 tweet  he compared them to  manure   and welcomes the actions of death squads   If it were up to me  they would have all the support   he told Congress in 2003  It looks like there s no need to legalize militias in Brazil  after all  Today one might have the impression that paramilitary groups are not merely acting as a parallel state   they are the state The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of

WASHINGTON   President Trump moved to clear out the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security on Monday  a day after  forcing the resignation of its secretary  Kirstjen Nielsen  as he accelerated a purge of the nation s immigration and security leadership The White House announced the departure of Randolph D  Alles  the director of the Secret Service  who had fallen out of favor with the president even before a security breach at his Mar a Lago club that the agency effectively blamed on Mr  Trump s employees Government officials  who asked not to be identified discussing personnel changes before they were announced  said at least two to four more high ranking figures affiliated with Ms  Nielsen were expected to leave soon  too  hollowing out the top echelon of the department managing border security  presidential safety  counterterrorism  natural disasters  customs and other matters The wave of departures of officials originally appointed by Mr  Trump underscored his growing frustration with his own administration s handling of immigration and other security issues  In recent days  Mr  Trump has threatened to close the southwestern border altogether only to back off and give Mexico a one year notice in the face of warnings about deep economic damage from such a move The shake up  coming more than two years into Mr  Trump s term  indicated that he is still searching for a team that will fulfill his desire for an even tougher approach to immigration  It also signaled the enduring influence of Stephen Miller  the president s hard line senior adviser who has complained about recalcitrant homeland security officials Some of the president s allies complained that he was going too far  taking out subordinates who actually share his goals on immigration at the prodding of White House aides hunting for scapegoats for the failure to control the border as he has promised to do  Without names  there s people in the White House that speak about immigration   Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  said in an interview   They haven t accomplished a whole lot  so they need to find some other way to make themselves look important  The latest shuffle came just a day after Mr  Trump pushed out Ms  Nielsen for not doing enough in his view to secure the border and three days after Ronald D  Vitiello  the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  was told to step aside so the administration could go in a  tougher direction   as Mr  Trump put it Officials said they expect to see the departures of L  Francis Cissna  the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  Kathy Nuebel Kovarik  one of his top deputies  and John Mitnick  the department s general counsel and a senior member of Ms  Nielsen s leadership team  All of them were said to be viewed by Mr  Miller as obstacles to implementing the president s policies The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other The White House is also pressing for the resignation of Claire Grady  the acting deputy secretary  who under law would normally fill in for Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Trump has already announced that he will install Kevin K  McAleenan  the Customs and Border Protection commissioner  as Ms  Nielsen s acting replacement  which he cannot do if Ms  Grady remains in place The latest moves appeared to be a housecleaning of officials associated with John F  Kelly  the president s former chief of staff and his first homeland security secretary  who was pushed out at the end of last year after months of tension with Mr  Trump Mr  Alles  a retired Marine major general who served with Mr  Kelly in the military and goes by Tex  was the first person from outside the Secret Service to head the agency in more than a century and some administration officials said he had a hard time fitting in At Mr  Trump s instruction  Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  told Mr  Alles at least 10 days ago to expect a transition after two years in office and to develop an exit plan  according to officials familiar with the discussions Mr  Trump  who talks with members of his own Secret Service detail  had soured on Mr  Alles a while ago  convinced that as an outsider he was not popular among the agents  officials said  The president even made fun of the director s looks  calling him Dumbo because of his ears  But a Secret Service ally of Mr  Alles disputed the notion that he did not fit in  saying that the director was well liked among the work force Mr  Alles was told to develop an exit plan before the arrest of a Chinese woman carrying a malware laced device at Mar a Lago  exposing holes in the security of the private club  The Secret Service was so disturbed that it issued a statement faulting the club s staff for not tracking its guests closely enough Some Secret Service officials said on Monday that they suspected that Mr  Alles s departure was accelerated in part because of the episode The White House made no mention of that in its statement announcing Mr  Alles s departure issued shortly after it was reported by CNN Mr  Alles  has done a great job at the agency over the last two years  and the president is thankful for his over 40 years of service to the country   Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  said in the statement She said he would be replaced in May by James M  Murray  a career Secret Service official who oversees protective operations Mr  Alles was the focus of an early fight between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kelly in the first months of the administration  Mr  Kelly threatened to resign as homeland security secretary if Mr  Alles was not made Secret Service director  according to former administration officials ImageRandolph D  Alles  the director of the Secret Service  received instructions 10 days ago to come up with an exit plan and was expected to leave on his own timeline CreditDavid Goldman Associated PressIn an email message to his work force on Monday  Mr  Alles confirmed that his departure was ordered by the president last month  No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my  firing    he wrote   I assure you that this is not the case  and in fact was told weeks ago by the administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security  The president has directed an orderly transition in leadership for this agency and I intend to abide by that direction   he added   It is my sincere regret that I was not able to address the work force prior to this announcement  Regardless of when the decision was made  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said Mr  Alles should testify before Congress about the Mar a Lago breach  The public and Congress need to know the extent to which adversarial governments   like China   and their agents are attempting to gain access to  or conduct electronic surveillance on  conversations or other information regarding national security at President Trump s properties   he said Not all of Mr  Trump s allies were happy with the moves  There s no doubt that Cissna has proved his competence  in a lot of things he s doing   things that the president is for   Mr  Grassley said  Referring to Mr  Cissna and Ms  Kovarik  both of whom once worked on his staff  Mr  Grassley said   If he gets rid of these two  it s self defeating because I don t know anyone else in the department or at least in immigration  who could do better One administration official said Mr  Cissna angered Mr  Miller by refusing to make changes to asylum policy without congressional approval  Under current law  unauthorized immigrants facing expedited removal may seek asylum before an immigration judge if found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture As for Ms  Nielsen  she expressed no unhappiness about her departure on Monday and thanked Mr  Trump  for the tremendous opportunity  to serve her country and the employees of her department for their efforts to secure the nation The latest departures  along with previous vacancies  will leave the Department of Homeland Security without a permanent secretary  deputy secretary  two under secretaries  Secret Service director  Federal Emergency Management Agency director  ICE director  general counsel  citizenship and immigration services director  inspector general  chief financial officer  chief privacy officer and  once Mr  McAleenan moves  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  The purge of senior leadership at the Department of Homeland Security is unprecedented and a threat to our national security   said Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California Senator Ron Johnson  Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  complained about  congressional dysfunction  in addressing border security  but added   I am concerned with a growing leadership void within the department tasked with addressing some of the most significant problems facing the nation   

UNITED NATIONS   Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday urged the United Nations to revoke the credentials of Venezuela s ambassador to the world body  portraying him as a loyalist to the country s disputed president  Nicols Maduro  and to a government that has allowed crime  violence and starvation to rise In a 20 minute speech to the United Nations Security Council  Mr  Pence called for a formal recognition of Juan Guaid as the rightful leader of Venezuela  which he called  a failed state   and as history teaches  failed states know no boundaries  Mr  Pence turned to the Venezuelan ambassador  Samuel Moncada Acosta  telling him   You shouldn t be here   You should return to Venezuela and tell Nicols Maduro that his time is up   Mr  Pence said   It s time for him to go  The Council meeting addressed the situation in Venezuela  which officials and experts are increasingly describing as a humanitarian crisis that has led about 3 5 million citizens to flee the country Instead of offering temporary asylum to Venezuelans  the Trump administration has called for Mr  Maduro s ouster to relieve a country rattled by skyrocketing inflation  widespread blackouts and a growing public health crisis  The United States  as a replacement  is forcefully supporting Mr  Guaid  the National Assembly politician whom the administration recognizes as the rightful interim president On Wednesday  Mr  Pence also accused China and Russia of meddling in efforts to remove Mr  Maduro  While  Russia and China continue to obstruct at the Security Council   Mr  Pence said   rogue states like Iran and Cuba are doing all they can to prop up the Maduro regime  Global rivalries have hindered the ability of the United Nations to address the crisis  despite intensifying warnings that the situation is deteriorating In February  the United States and Russia introduced dueling resolutions on Venezuela at the Security Council  The American proposal called for free and fair elections  and the Russian plan backed Mr  Maduro s government  Both failed Two weeks ago  President Trump warned Russia to  get out of  Venezuela after two of Moscow s military planes landed in Caracas  the Venezuelan capital  to unload supplies and military personnel  But Mr  Trump has done little else to publicly engage as the crisis continues That role has fallen to Mr  Pence  But on Wednesday  he did not give a firm answer when asked by a reporter where the United States would draw a line on Russia s involvement  He also did not give a timeline when asked if the possibility of American military intervention  an option long played up by administration officials  was drawing closer as conditions in Venezuela worsened Instead  the Trump administration has tried to choke off Mr  Maduro s economic resources  Last week  it announced a round of sanctions targeting oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba  the latest in a string of initiatives meant to curb Caracas s ability to do business  Visas have been revoked in recent weeks for hundreds of Mr  Maduro s associates In briefings held before Mr  Pence arrived to speak  United Nations officials warned of a situation that has only grown more dire as unrest continues and said that offering relief to Venezuelan citizens should not be a political issue Mark Lowcock  an under secretary for humanitarian affairs  told the Security Council that a recent draft overview of the situation by the United Nations indicated that around 1 9 million people require nutritional assistance because of worsening food availability  including 1 3 million children under 5  Additionally  Mr  Lowcock said  tuberculosis  diphtheria  measles  malaria and other preventable diseases have resurfaced in Venezuela Food shortages also remain a main factor in driving people out of the country  Surveys show that 80 percent of Venezuelan households struggle with finding enough food  United Nations officials said  In Venezuela  there is a need to separate political and humanitarian objectives   Mr  Lowcock said   Humanitarian assistance must be delivered on the basis of need alone  The number of people expected to leave Venezuela may surpass five million by the year s end  said Eduardo Stein  a special United Nations envoy for Venezuelan refugees and migrants Citing a worsening public health crisis aggravated by constant blackouts  Kathleen Page  a doctor and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine  urged the Security Council to declare a humanitarian crisis formally and address it in a  neutral  independent and impartial  way On Tuesday  Mr  Maduro said he had met with members of the Red Cross to finalize plans for the arrival of aid to Venezuela  His government and the opposition reached a deal to organize a large scale relief effort late last month  We reiterated our disposition to establish cooperation mechanisms for international aid and assistance   Mr  Maduro wrote Tuesday on Twitter The United States still does not have a permanent representative to the United Nations  a fact that reporters pointed out to Mr  Pence as he fielded questions over whether the Security Council would support his demand to revoke the Venezuelan ambassador s credentials Mr  Pence said he felt that  momentum is on the side of freedom   

WASHINGTON   Furious opposition from both the House Democrats  most ardent liberals and their fiscal hawks forced Democratic leaders on Tuesday to delay voting on a two year budget measure that would increase military and domestic spending  an embarrassing send off as the new majority prepared to leave for a three day retreat The decision to indefinitely postpone the vote underscored the Democrats  lack of unity almost 100 days into their majority and the challenge facing Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team as they try to bridge an ideological gap between upstart progressives flexing their muscles and more moderate members clinging to their Republican leaning seats  This is not an outcome   Ms  Pelosi told reporters on Tuesday   This is a process  Asked if a spending deal was possible despite the party s factions  Ms  Pelosi said   Of course  The bill   championed by Representatives John Yarmuth of Kentucky  the chairman of the House Budget Committee  and Nita M  Lowey of New York  the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee   would set higher military and domestic spending levels than the hard caps fixed in the Budget Control Act of 2011  It had been presented last week as a substitute to a broader budget blueprint that would have outlined policy priorities in health care  taxation  defense and other areas  as well as new spending limits But liberals were angered by the continued increase in military spending and demanded even more money for domestic programs  Budget hawks worried about the unabated rise in spending with no effort to bring down a rising tide of red ink  the bill would increase military and domestic spending limits by more than  350 billion over the next two years Republicans reveled in the disarray  Representative Steve Womack of Arkansas  the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee  called it  another embarrassing failure to govern  Some Democrats involved with the budget process played down the decision to shelve the vote  arguing that the best outcome in divided government would emerge from negotiations with the Republican majority in the Senate and the White House  They pointed to an agreement between Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  President Trump and Ms  Pelosi to allow staff to begin work on a two year spending caps deal in the coming weeks  Congress has previously negotiated deals to bypass the Budget Control Act caps  but a failure to act again before the fiscal year that begins in October would lead to automatic cuts totaling  125 billion  I m hoping this will be the beginning of a bipartisan agreement that will be necessary in order to have an orderly appropriations process not only this year  but next year as well   Mr  McConnell told reporters  The prospect of bicameral talks was first raised in March  and Mr  McConnell called Ms  Pelosi to finalize plans on Tuesday afternoon  according to two aides briefed on the interactions And lawmakers on Tuesday approved a procedural vote that set the top spending levels for negotiating spending bills for the next fiscal year   allowing appropriators to begin working on legislation that would fund the government through 2020  Representative Steny H  Hoyer  Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader  said earlier in the day that he plans to push for spending bills to be completed by the end of June to avoid another shutdown Ultimately  the spending limits put forward by Mr  Yarmuth and Ms  Lowey could not secure the necessary 218 votes because of opposition from the Congressional Progressive Caucus and members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition  In the hallway outside the chamber  representatives from the two groups stood just feet apart as they explained their different reasons for opposing the bill  At some point  we re going to have to pass something   said Mr  Yarmuth  who made the decision not to hold a vote this week   I d love to do it as soon as possible  Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin  one of the leaders of the Progressive Caucus  had told leadership in a private meeting on Tuesday morning that the caucus had enough votes to kill the caps bill  according to two people familiar with the meeting  And members of the Progressive Caucus celebrated the delay in voting  with Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington  a chairwoman of the caucus  calling it  a big victory   It became clear that without real  strong progressive inclusion into the process of a bill  we re not going to be able to get there   Ms  Jayapal said   Hopefully  everyone understands that the best chance of success for a united caucus is for us to be consulted and to be at the table  Anticipating difficult negotiations with the Republican controlled Senate  some liberals argued that the House should pass legislation that spends less on the military and more on domestic programs  understanding that those numbers would have to adjust as talks progress  I don t understand why we want to concede before waging the battle   said Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and a vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus   You don t wave the white flag of surrender before a single shot has fired  Members of the caucus had also raised concerns about what they said was an imbalance between military and domestic spending during meetings this month  according to aides familiar with the conversations but unauthorized to discuss them publicly The bill  which scraped through the Budget Committee  would raise the limits on domestic spending by 5 7 percent  to  631 billion in fiscal 2020 and  646 billion in fiscal 2021  compared to a 2 6 percent increase in military spending  Military limits would still rise  to  664 billion in the next fiscal year and  680 billion in fiscal 2021 Mr  Yarmuth and his allies faced additional pressure from the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition  which balked at the decision to pass on a budget blueprint Blue Dogs warned that the coalition would collectively block planned amendments from liberals that would increase domestic spending in the bill even further to win over the votes of Ms  Jayapal  Mr  Pocan and other liberals  according to a senior Democratic aide  Any budget needed to hew toward fiscal responsibility  particularly at a time when we re sitting at a  22 trillion debt   said Representative Stephanie Murphy  Democrat of Florida and chairwoman of the Blue Dog Coalition   It s one of the key responsibilities of Congress  On Tuesday  the group endorsed a constitutional amendment put forward by one of its freshman members  Representative Ben McAdams  Democrat of Utah  that would bar the federal government from spending more than it receives in a single fiscal year  except in the case of war or recession  The balanced budget amendment has been pushed by Republicans for decades  It s clearer than ever that the only way Congress will be able to produce a balanced budget is if it is required to do so by law   said Representative Lou Correa  Democrat of California and a co chairman of the coalition  in a statement   Washington needs to have a serious  bipartisan discussion about our nation s fiscal state  There will be no more votes until April 29  Democrats are to spend three days at a Virginia retreat meant to help members bond before joining the rest of the House for a two week spring recess  

WASHINGTON   When President Trump met with his embattled homeland security secretary on Sunday to force her out after months of stormy eruptions over immigration policy  the only other person in the room was Mick Mulvaney  who made no effort to head off the final confrontation and instead helped draft the letter of resignation When Mr  Trump decided to get rid of his Secret Service director  officials said  Mr  Mulvaney delivered the message rather than try to talk the president out of it  When Mr  Trump considered whether to ask a court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act despite opposition from his own top legal advisers  Mr  Mulvaney s response  Follow your gut In his first 100 days as the president s acting chief of staff  Mr  Mulvaney has assumed a central role in Mr  Trump s circle but one markedly different than the previous two occupants of his corner office  For the first time since taking office  Mr  Trump has a chief of staff who has made it his job to encourage rather than restrain the president s conservative instincts   to let Trump be Trump  in effect A former congressman from South Carolina and a leader of the Tea Party movement  Mr  Mulvaney is not a product of the Republican establishment like Reince Priebus  the first chief of staff  or the military hierarchy  like John F  Kelly  the second  Instead  he arrived at the White House from the revolutionary wing of the conservative movement  whose goal even before Mr  Trump entered politics was to blow up what it considered a corrupt and liberal Washington  I don t think that he sees the role of the chief of staff to alter the personality of the person he works for   said former Representative Trey Gowdy  a friend and fellow South Carolina Republican who golfed with the president and Mr  Mulvaney last month   They have a good relationship  but the president s the boss  Some outsiders see the cascade of hard line policy ventures  unorthodox appointments and high level purges of recent days as a sign of Mr  Mulvaney s expanding influence  assuming that he is pushing Mr  Trump to the right  But insiders call that a misconception  insisting that Mr  Mulvaney at most is pushing on an open door and otherwise is merely liberating Mr  Trump to pursue the courses he prefers The lesson Mr  Mulvaney took from the unhappy experiences of Mr  Priebus and Mr  Kelly   both of whom were cast out unceremoniously via Twitter or comments to reporters   was that Mr  Trump is not interested in being managed by aides who think they know better  and so he has tried to build a process that he thinks better serves the president To some Republicans who had become resigned to an ungovernable White House  Mr  Mulvaney has been a welcome presence  one who has tamped down some of the tribal rivalries that played out in vicious form through clandestine disclosures to the news media  I think he s become an asset because he s learned how to keep the Trump train running   said Scott Reed  the top political adviser to the United States Chamber of Commerce   A combination of managing the staff  raising the morale and limiting the leaking has made him a successful Trump chief of staff  But to his critics  including some Republicans  Mr  Mulvaney s approach has unleashed the president in dangerous ways  After forcing a five week government shutdown at the start of the year  Mr  Trump in recent days threatened to close the nation s southern border  selected unconventional nominees for the Federal Reserve despite significant vetting issues and began clearing out the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security In a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  lamented the  chaos  in the White House stemming from the president s  whimsical  erratic  behavior  I hope that the president or some of the people around him will realize that his administration is far from a fine tuned machine   he said   It s a slow motion disaster machine that the American people see in action every day  Even some Republicans on Capitol Hill hold Mr  Mulvaney in low regard  particularly senators who view him as a former congressman with little deal making experience and scant inclination to learn  In recent days  some criticized the expanding homeland security purge while others complained that Mr  Mulvaney does not meet with them enough During tense negotiations amid the government shutdown earlier this year  Senator Richard C  Shelby  the Alabama Republican and Appropriations Committee chairman  complained bitterly about Mr  Mulvaney s penchant for undoing weeks of bipartisan work with a quick comment to Mr  Trump in the Oval Office  Mr  Shelby told Senator Patrick J  Leahy of Vermont  the committee s top Democrat  that Mr  Mulvaney was  the most dangerous man  in Washington  according to three people familiar with the exchange Mr  Shelby has not repeated that in public  but when a reporter on Capitol Hill asked him about Mr  Mulvaney last week  the senator tartly interrupted to offer a correction ImageMr  Trump and Mr  Mulvaney at the White House  Mr  Mulvaney has made it his job to encourage rather than restrain the president s conservative instincts CreditDoug Mills The New York Times You mean the acting chief of staff   he said before walking away Mr  Trump has yet to formally remove the  acting  before the title  but after more than three months Mr  Mulvaney shrugs that off  telling others that everyone who works for the president serves at his pleasure and therefore is acting Indeed  Mr  Mulvaney is operating not as a temporary caretaker  but as someone who expects to stay for a while  bringing to the West Wing a clutch of aides from the Office of Management and Budget  where he served as director  He has engaged in team building exercises like retreats at Camp David  most recently last week to discuss efforts to create a replacement for the Affordable Care Act He is generally liked by the staff  which recoiled at Mr  Kelly s military style  Mr  Kelly made clear that he hated the job  muttering out loud when he left on many evenings that he might not return the next day  By contrast  Mr  Mulvaney tells people that he loves the job  an attitude that allies said has improved morale Even some Democrats praised Mr  Mulvaney for reaching out  Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky  chairman of the House Budget Committee  said his relations with Mr  Mulvaney were  excellent  and noted that he was invited to Camp David for a trust building visit  Mick s never going to resolve Trump s erratic behavior   Mr  Yarmuth said   He s never going to be able to do anything about that  But over all  I think he s been a much more effective chief than Kelly has  Still  Mr  Mulvaney has been criticized internally  by colleagues unwilling to be identified  for creating his own fief  And he has been faulted for appealing to Mr  Trump s nativist instincts and desire to cater to his hard core political base Mr  Trump does not share Mr  Mulvaney s special passion for hawkish fiscal policies but signed off on a largely symbolic budget that incorporated some of those priorities  only to overrule his aides when proposed funding cuts to Special Olympics were publicized  The biggest problem I sense with Mulvaney is because of his own politics  he tends to push Trump further to the right than even Trump might want to go   said Leon E  Panetta  who held the job under President Bill Clinton   As chief of staff  your greater responsibility is to present to the president the options for what he should decide  Mr  Mulvaney has told people that he strives to do just that  ensuring that the president hears different points of view  During the deliberations over the Affordable Care Act  allies noted that Mr  Mulvaney made sure that Mr  Trump heard objections lodged by the Justice Department and White House counsel While Mr  Mulvaney has kept the essence of Mr  Kelly s policy development procedure  he consults with Mr  Trump earlier in the process to get his direction  rather than wait until the end  Although he was known as a firebrand in the House who stood up to Republican leaders  he is deferential to Mr  Trump  calling him  boss   while making a point of spending off hours on the golf course with him In the West Wing  Mr  Mulvaney is seen as someone who knows when to fight battles  as opposed to Mr  Kelly  who often found himself at odds with Mr  Trump s adult children and informal advisers  He does not try to manage access to the president as Mr  Kelly did  Rather than fight Mr  Trump s natural desire to meet and talk with a variety of people  Mr  Mulvaney has taken a decentralized approach that he calls chief of staff by committee  empowering different advisers to provide the president their guidance It is a style most associated with Presidents Gerald R  Ford and Jimmy Carter  each of whom resisted having a strong chief of staff at first  preferring what was called a  hub and spoke  model in which many people had access to the Oval Office  Both eventually abandoned the approach  concluding that it did not work  and Mr  Mulvaney eschews the hub and spoke term to avoid associations with those failed experiments People close to the president say Mr  Mulvaney gets too much credit   or blame   for Mr  Trump s rightward turn on policy  Mr  Trump s instinct is to appeal to core supporters who he fears will leave him  and he is the one who wants to demonstrate to them that he is continuing a hard line on immigration David Bossie  president of the conservative group Citizens United and a former deputy campaign manager for Mr  Trump  said the president was adjusting to a changing political environment  The president is responding to that new world order and that s the mind set   Mr  Bossie said   He is under siege by congressional Democrats  and that is how he s operating   under siege  And Mr  Mulvaney is in the trench next to him  

Democrats are hoping that President Trump s federal tax returns will serve as a Rosetta stone to unlock the secrets of his murky finances  Mr  Trump  on the other hand  has spent the past three years refusing to divulge the returns and even dismissing them as boring Now  the fight over whether members of Congress have the right to see the president s tax returns is intensifying  The House tax writing committee has demanded them  and late Wednesday  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department would not comply with the request by the date set by the committee  Earlier in the day  Mr  Trump repeated that he would not disclose his returns  falsely claiming that there is no law that gives Congress the authority to obtain them  Mr  Trump is the first president in four decades to not publicly release his tax returns  The refusal   coupled with his continued ownership of a far flung network of closely held businesses   has fanned suspicions that he has something to hide  So  what might lawmakers find if they obtain Mr  Trump s tax filings For starters  his recent returns could illuminate the sources of his income and any tax avoidance strategies he may have used  but it would not fully decode the family s personal and business finances Leaked pages of the president s old tax returns and other financial documents already have shed light on his finances  They indicate that Mr  Trump most likely avoided paying income taxes for a number of years and that in other periods The New York Times found he participated in fraudulent tax schemes to minimize his tax bill  His federal ethics filings show hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding loans and a business network owned through a web of corporate entities The House Ways and Means Committee last week requested six years of Mr  Trump s personal tax returns  along with the returns filed by one of his trusts and seven subsidiaries he controls  They also asked for records of any audits  The returns would partly reveal the sources of the president s income  and whether his businesses are profitable  They would show how much  if anything  Mr  Trump has been paying in taxes and might show whether he has been aggressive in reducing his tax bills  They will show whether Mr  Trump has personally donated to charity The returns requested by the committee  however  would not fully answer longstanding questions about the identities of Mr  Trump s business partners  the ultimate sources of his income or whether he is entangled with entities that have interests before his administration  Even if Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  who leads the committee  is successful  it does not mean the tax returns will become public  By law  they are supposed to remain solely in the hands of the committee  an unauthorized release would be a felony  Update  House chairman says treasury s reasons to withhold Trump s tax returns  lack merit   How much is Mr  Trump worth Ever since he declared his candidacy  Mr  Trump   a self proclaimed billionaire   has faced questions about whether he is exaggerating his wealth Mr  Trump has never substantiated his assertion that he is a billionaire  though he has repeatedly made the claim to banks and other institutions  The disclosure of his tax returns probably would not settle the debate over Mr  Trump s net worth Tax returns do not provide lists of assets or liabilities  unless they generate income or deductions  Even then  the returns most likely would not provide values of those assets or liabilities Still  Mr  Trump s full tax returns   his personal returns and the ones for all of the components of the Trump Organization   would give a sense of the profitability of his businesses  The returns would also reveal whether his companies have taken a hit since he entered the White House   Mr  Trump has said he has lost vast amounts of money since he became president  Whom is Mr  Trump in business with Mr  Trump for years ran the Trump Organization  a privately held company that manages real estate  golf resorts  brand and licensing deals and other interests  Much about the businesses  finances remains unknown  The federal ethics disclosures Mr  Trump has made about his holdings so far have been limited  For example  there is no requirement that he report the identities of investors who have put money into his businesses  Mr  Trump acquired many properties  in particular golf courses  with cash  but where did that cash come from  Mr  Trump s son Eric once told a journalist that the Trump Organization s golf properties were paid for with Russian money  Eric Trump has denied making that statement  While Mr  Trump s federal filings have reported some outstanding loans  investments and income from each business  they do not include debts where he has a partial interest or older loans that have been paid off  In theory  the existence of those older loans   and the lenders behind them   could be disclosed on his historical tax returns because certain types of interest on debts can be tax deductible In reality  much of that information is unlikely to be contained in the limited number of returns requested by Congress  The panel is seeking the returns for only a small number of Mr  Trump s companies  But he controls hundreds of separate L L C s that contain individual businesses  as varied as a particular building or the rights to license his name overseas  Each one of those businesses may file its own tax return  separate from the ones requested by the committee How exactly does Mr  Trump make his money Mr  Trump owns and operates businesses in the United States and overseas  He earns revenue from golf club memberships  from leasing space in his buildings and from licensing deals to put the  Trump  name on other developers  properties  Mr  Trump s government disclosure reports show ranges of how much revenue his various subsidiaries collect  as provided by Mr  Trump  but they do not indicate the companies  overall profitability For example  his most recent government ethics report states that his Irish golf business reported revenue of  14 million in 2017  However  Irish regulators require that the golf subsidiary make its filings public  Those disclosures show the business actually lost about  2 million that year  Mr  Trump s returns could provide further detail about the profitability of his other businesses  More broadly  his tax returns can be compared with the ethics disclosures to check the accuracy of the filings Mr  Trump s personal tax returns will also itemize his stock  and bond market transactions and people and institutions he is receiving income from  domestic and foreign  This would include income he has received from banks Is Mr  Trump cheating on his taxes If Democrats get Mr  Trump s taxes  they will be looking for any aggressive or illegal maneuvers   such as the fraudulent tactics he has used in the past Sophisticated tax filers use their returns to paint the picture of their finances they want the government to see  It usually takes a lot of digging to find out what is going on behind the numbers For example  as The New York Times reported last year  Mr  Trump and his siblings set up a sham corporation in the early 1990s to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents In that case  The Times had access to far more than just tax returns  It also relied on confidential business filings  public records and information from sources to document the fraud At the time the article was published  a lawyer for the president  Charles J  Harder  said the allegations of fraud and tax evasion were 100 percent false  and highly defamatory What will be more immediately apparent in Mr  Trump s tax returns is what sort of deductions he has used to reduce his tax bill  and how aggressively he has used them In 1995  for example  Mr  Trump paid no income tax  and records show he has not paid income tax in several other years  The president has said he has avoided taxes because of the generous deductions given to real estate owners like himself  One deduction is depreciation  which permits real estate investors to deduct a portion of the cost of their buildings from their taxable income  I have a write off  A lot of it is depreciation  which is a wonderful charge   he said during a presidential debate in 2016   I love depreciation   

Is Israel ready for a changing of the guard The outcome of Tuesday s parliamentary election will determine whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party will continue to lead the country  Mr  Netanyahu  who has been embroiled by corruption allegations  continues to be seen by many Israeli Jews as critical to their country s future security  But he s facing a strong challenge from the newly formed Blue and White party  led by the former military chief Benny Gantz  Israel uses a parliamentary system in which many parties jockey for votes  Even if Mr  Netanyahu s Likud wins fewer seats than Mr  Gantz s party  he may be better positioned to form a governing coalition by working with conservative parties  Read more about Israel s political parties and the election process here  We asked Israeli citizens how they plan to vote and which issues matter most to them  Though we sought feedback from citizens of all backgrounds  and reached out in English and Arabic  our 200 responses were overwhelmingly from Jews  perhaps because many of Israel s nearly two million Arab citizens plan to boycott the election  Many said they had chosen Likud or Blue and White  and listed the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians among their chief concerns  Others said they were more focused on the economy and social issues such as L G B T  rights  saying they would vote for parties like the New Right  the center right party Kulanu or the left wing secular party Meretz  Below are some of their responses  which have been condensed and edited If you re an Israeli citizen  which party will you vote for  Tell us in the comments  Israel Elections  How the Country Chooses a Leader and What s at StakeApril 9  2019Israeli Palestinian Conflict and SecurityPeace with the Palestinians has remained elusive during Mr  Netanyahu s time as prime minister  Violence has surged in the West Bank at times  there were wars with Islamic militants in Gaza in 2012 and 2014  and recent clashes between Israel and Hamas along the Gaza border have been deadly  Palestinians in the West Bank  Gaza and East Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote on Tuesday  Chana Selmon  JerusalemI am voting for the New Right  Naftali Bennett s party  because I am in favor of the annexation of the territories Judea and Samaria and the West Bank so as to apply Israeli law to all who

application of environmental regulations  the burning garbage  pollution and contamination there are horrific  and better relations among different demographic populations  Alec Siegel  Tel AvivGantz takes a more sober  realistic approach to the conflict with the Palestinians  His background as the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff certainly helps  but he seems to grasp the more diplomatic aspects of being a head of state as well He advocates smaller steps that could improve lives on all sides while keeping in mind the ultimate goal of two states  without simply paying lip service to a lofty ideal Seraj Assi  WashingtonI m boycotting the election  As a Palestinian citizen of Israel  I have no reason to be optimistic about my future in the country  If by simply exercising my basic democratic right to vote  I am posing a threat to Israel s political order  as Netanyahu has constantly hinted  then I can only imagine where my struggle for equal rights stands right now  What s more  Arabs will have no say in the new government  regardless of who wins  All major party  Jewish  leaders said they will not invite Arab parties to join a government coalition  That explains why many Arabs are boycotting  with reasons ranging from racism and discrimination to lack of faith in both Arab parties and Israel s democracy  Hanan Cohen  Beit ShemeshI am Jewish  The Arab citizens in

and support Likud  Besides their foreign relations successes  Likud and Netanyahu have led impressive growth in the economy that has benefited my family  along with most families in Israel The allegations against Netanyahu are serious but have been way overblown by the media  Likud has a deep bench of experienced leaders who can certainly hold the reins if Netanyahu is sidelined Jonathan Mosery  ModiinI plan on voting for Benny Gantz Netanyahu has been in power too long  He has done great work and will undoubtedly be remembered as one of Israel s top prime ministers and central to Israel s emergence as an economic powerhouse and regional power  but power corrupts  Whether or not the allegations about Netanyahu are true  he has held the reins too long and become obsessed with holding on as long as possible  rather than putting the country s needs first Stav Cohen  RehovotNetanyahu cares so deeply about Israel  In a time where we feel like the world despises our every move  we need him to remain in office I obviously don t approve of his scandals  but I love him as our prime minister The EconomyIsrael s economy and tech sector have grown steadily under Mr  Netanyahu  and in a poll of likely voters taken a month before the election  almost half said economic issues were most important to them Leora Danzig Leeder  JerusalemI plan on voting  Not Netanyahu   He has had four rounds  and with each passing year it becomes clear that his main interest is lining his pockets I am primarily concerned about the financial and social issues that affect my family  The cost of living is too high  especially in Jerusalem  and one day I would like to be able to afford to buy rather than rent  As a single mother  it is sometimes difficult to imagine thriving financially  rather than just surviving Shimon Zlotnick  ModiinI will be voting for Kulanu because its focus is not only on security  but more important on issues that face Israel every day  such as rising costs and breaking monopolies L G B T  RightsWhile gay rights have garnered wide support in Israel  the ultra Orthodox  who are part of Mr  Netanyahu s governing coalition  have resisted laws protecting same sex couples  Last summer Israelis demonstrated against the rejection of an amendment that would have allowed gay men to father children through surrogates  Eyal Landman  Tel AvivMeretz is wholeheartedly against the continued occupation and fights for human rights and the L G B T  cause  Out of three siblings  two of us are L G B T  and we fear the ultra right wing party s rise to power

serious negotiations it is completely possible to leave some settlements and to evacuate more isolated ones Yael Schottenstein  Givat ZeevI am voting for the United Right party  We need a stronger

conservative Likud party currently leads a right wing and religious coalition Amir Aharoni  JerusalemI hope for a coalition that includes the big secular parties  Likud  Blue and White  Labor  and perhaps Kulanu or even Meretz  and no religious parties If Netanyahu becomes the prime minister and forms a coalition with the secular parties  then this is the best scenario  We can expect some economic and social reforms  such as finally allowing public transportation on Saturday and civil marriages  especially for L G B T  people and for non Jews  Tal Harris  Ra ananaI have reservations

On Wednesday  the Justice Department put Alabama on notice over the state s  flagrant disregard  for the constitutional rights of inmates in its prisons  The department said that conditions in the state s prisons are among the nation s very worst  After carefully reviewing the evidence   department officials wrote in a letter addressed to Gov  Kay Ivey   we conclude that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions at Alabama s prisons violate the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution   which protects against cruel and unusual forms of punishment The findings in an accompanying 56 page report   the result of an investigation that began in 2016   shock the conscience  Violent attacks and grisly deaths discovered long after they ve occurred  Contraband and makeshift weapons that go undetected  Sexual abuse occurring  at all hours of the day and night   Overcrowding so excessive and staffing so inadequate that inmates are virtually unsupervised and  in the words of a former warden   in extreme danger   Grossly inadequate health care  And  according to federal statistics noted in the report  the highest prison homicide rate in the country The Justice Department found that the state failed to protect inmates  from prisoner on prisoner violence and prisoner on prisoner sexual abuse   leading to a  pattern or practice  of constitutional violations throughout the Alabama prison system Such disdain for basic human decency calls for immediate steps  which Alabama officials have said they intend to take by requesting increased funding for more officers and better  more modern prisons But intervention and oversight are needed  In announcing the findings  the Justice Department effectively started the 49 day clock under federal law for Alabama to take corrective actions  or risk a lawsuit in federal court   This case cries out for a consent decree   said Jonathan Smith  the former chief of the Justice Department s civil rights unit that was charged with making sure state and local governments respect the constitutional rights of their citizens William Barr  America s new attorney general  ought to seek court intervention if the state fails to follow the Justice Department s recommendations   which include hiring up to 500 correctional officers  revising security protocols and addressing basic housing deficiencies  such as bathrooms and living areas in disrepair  that rob inmates of their dignity Before the Justice Department s announcement  The Times published an account of the conditions at one of the Alabama facilities under review  the St  Clair Correctional Facility  based on 2 000 photographs obtained by a civil rights group   It is hard to imagine a cache of images less suitable for publication   they are full of nudity  indignity and gore   The Times s Shaila Dewan wrote last week   It is also hard to imagine photographs that cry out more insistently to be seen  Indeed  the story that those images tell   backed up by the disturbing conclusions of the Justice Department report   need to be spread far and wide RelatedMore on Alabama prisonsInside America s Black Box  A Rare Look at the Violence of IncarcerationMarch 30  2019Alabama s Gruesome Prisons  Report Finds Rape and Murder at All HoursApril 3  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

VIEQUES  P R    A newborn s cries rarely echo anymore though the hallways of what passes as a hospital on the ravaged island of Vieques  off the coast of Puerto Rico  We miss it   said Dennisse Bermdez Coln  a nurse Hurricane Maria closed the island s only labor and delivery room  forcing expectant mothers to travel  usually by sea  to the big island eight miles away to have their babies  Just a few emergency births have taken place in an old storm shelter converted into a provisional clinic Nearly 18 months after the storm  the temporary arrangement feels increasingly permanent  The original hospital remains a shuttered wreck of rust and mold  home to the occasional rooster and a band of wild horses whose droppings litter the empty parking lot and ambulance bay  If they keep doing nothing  the hospital will get more deteriorated   Isabel Encarnacin Nazario  65  lamented on a recent morning as she picked up a lab work kit for her ailing 90 year old mother from the makeshift clinic The languishing Vieques hospital is one of many places where rebuilding has stagnated nearly a year and a half after the ruinous September 2017 hurricane  Repairs have yet to begin  slowed by disagreements over the project s scope and cost  though reopening the hospital is supposed to be a top priority Puerto Rico was in financial distress and had crumbling infrastructure before Hurricane Maria  and many residents complain of government malfeasance that exacerbated the storm s impact  echoing criticism from Washington  But Puerto Rican leaders say the delay to the Vieques hospital and thousands of other stalled projects is a reflection of unequal treatment from the White House and Congress  which last week failed to pass disaster relief legislation because of a dispute over how much money to send the island ImageWith the island s only labor and delivery room closed  expectant mothers must travel  usually by sea  to the big island eight miles away to give birth CreditErika P  Rodriguez for The New York TimesThe dispute has interfered with aid reaching other parts of the country  including Midwestern states seeking flood relief and coastal states looking to increase hurricane protection  President Trump again accused Puerto Rican politicians of corruption and incompetence last week  signaling his unwillingness to approve more funds for the bankrupt commonwealth  So many wonderful people  but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter Republican and Democratic lawmakers have endorsed providing Puerto Rico with  600 million to address a more basic need than reconstruction  hunger  After the nearly Category 5 hurricane  Congress authorized  1 27 billion for Puerto Rico s food stamp program  which for a year increased recipients  monthly benefits to match those on the mainland  The bump expired last month  I haven t eaten in two days   Mara Concepcin  52  said last week in the parking lot of a local food stamp office in the municipality of Bayamn  outside San Juan  the capital  A few minutes later  she burst into tears Ms  Concepcin  who said she is epileptic and suffering from cancer  had walked about two hours from her home only to learn that her appointment had been canceled  She hoped to request more money  after her benefit was cut more than half  to  108 a month  It s not enough   she said About 85 percent of food on the island is imported  elevating prices for consumers  Some 1 3 million of 3 2 million Puerto Ricans   about 43 percent of the population   qualify for food stamps  The island has been in an economic recession for 12 years  It s not much  but it s something   William Miranda  59  a janitor who lost his job after the hurricane  said at the food stamp office   We buy as much as possible on special at the supermarket   added his wife  Carmen Lugo  62 Image I haven t eaten in two days   Mara Concepcin  52  said CreditErika P  Rodriguez for The New York TimesHouse Democrats have pushed for funding beyond the food stamp program  including  849 million for the Environmental Protection Agency to fix damaged water systems  about  150 million in housing grants for Puerto Ricans to repair their homes  and a provision requiring the Federal Emergency Management Agency to pay the full cost of permanent work on public buildings and other infrastructure  as it did after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy Without the FEMA provision  Puerto Rico could have to pick up 10 percent of the rebuilding costs   billions of dollars the commonwealth government  whose finances have been controlled by a federal oversight board since 2016  said it does not have That is why Gov  Ricardo A  Rossell  other Puerto Rican officials and their allies on Capitol Hill have cast the disaster relief package as critical for the island s long term rebuilding  The legislation would not provide direct funding for projects like the Vieques hospital  but it would help ensure that the Puerto Rican government s budget troubles don t hold the project up  This affects everything   Mr  Rossell  a Democrat  said in an interview last week   It hinders the recovery  It hinders our objective of having an energy grid that is sustainable  that s reliable and that s modern  It hinders our capability of fixing our water systems  Also awaiting funding  police stations  public schools and roads  The town of Villalba needs to replace its emergency operations center and an assisted living facility for seniors  both destroyed by the hurricane  Mayor Luis Javier Hernndez said   The town has leased other buildings to house the facilities in the meantime   Residents of nearby Barranquitas  in Puerto Rico s mountainous central region  have had to take 40 minute detours along country roads because two major bridges were washed out  It s been dangerous  and there have been several accidents   Mayor Francisco Lpez of Barranquitas said   It s really concerning  because the hurricane was a year and a half ago   and we re two months from the start of a new hurricane season  In the San Juan neighborhood of Ocean Park  where some streets were flooded with smelly water for two weeks after Hurricane Maria  Jess Herbn  the owner of a local bakery  jokes that he has become an expert on water pumps from all the time he has devoted to learning about how they failed during the storm ImageMobile units form a makeshift clinic on Vieques  where patients can receive dialysis and dental care CreditErika P  Rodriguez for The New York Times This could have turned into a source of infection   Mr  Herbn said   Of course we re worried it could happen again  Temporary pumps are now backing up the old ones while the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources awaits FEMA funds for permanent upgrades  a department spokeswoman said So far  FEMA and other agencies have disbursed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the federal Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion has been allocated but not yet distributed  the budget office estimates the island could receive  91 billion over the next 20 years  It is the biggest amount appropriated to the island  that s true  but it is the biggest disaster to hit our island   said Representative Jenniffer Gonzlez Coln  a Republican and Puerto Rico s nonvoting member of Congress   People get frustrated that all the money has been there   you can smell it  you can touch it   but you can t grab it  The Trump administration has questioned Puerto Rico s ability to spend the money wisely ever since the commonwealth awarded a  300 million contract to Whitefish Energy  a Montana company with only two employees  Puerto Rico later created a recovery agency and agreed to additional oversight  though some residents remain skeptical that the money will be well spent  Donald Trump is partly right   scoundrel that he is   because in Puerto Rico we live off the government   said Ms  Encarnacin  the Vieques resident Most of the aid Puerto Rico has received has gone toward emergency work  including debris removal and power restoration  a huge undertaking that took nearly a year  The New York Times found last year that much of FEMA s money for emergency home repairs went to contractors charging steep markups ImageEdwin Alvarado Cordero suffered a heart attack on the ferry to the big island  where he was traveling for dialysis  He had open heart surgery and survived CreditErika P  Rodriguez for The New York TimesFor Mr  Rossell  the funding fight is a question of fairness  For every long term rebuilding project underway in Puerto Rico at this point after Hurricane Maria  there were 28 projects underway in Texas for damage from Hurricane Harvey  and 32 projects in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina  the governor said   Puerto Rico is getting much fewer and much lower resources than any comparable jurisdiction in the United States  A University of Michigan analysis published in the journal BMJ Global Health in January found it took twice as long   four months   for Hurricane Maria survivors in Puerto Rico to receive a comparable amount of individual aid  about  1 billion  as Hurricane Harvey survivors in Texas and Hurricane Irma survivors in Florida  though Maria was stronger and more devastating  Maria killed an estimated 2 975 people in Puerto Rico In addition to the slow disbursement of aid  a report last month from the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development lacked a robust plan to monitor disaster relief grants  including  20 billion approved for Puerto Rico In Vieques  with the hospital out of commission  dialysis patients had to travel to the big island three times a week to get treatment for more than a year after the storm  Several patients died  Finally  in November  a mobile dialysis unit in a shiny trailer arrived at the temporary clinic  allowing local treatments to resume  It wasn t easy   said Edwin Alvarado Cordero  a 58 year old diabetic  Standing across the street from the pharmacy in Isabel Segunda  the bigger of the island s two towns  Mr  Alvarado recounted his thrice weekly trips from Vieques to Humacao  which began at 4 a m  and ended at 5 30 p m Last year  on the ferry to the big island  Mr  Alvarado suffered a heart attack  He had open heart surgery and survived  Though he can now receive dialysis in Vieques  he still travels to San Juan periodically to see his cardiologist  Specialists visit Vieques infrequently  It s far  but it s better there   Mr  Alvarado said   What s left of the hospital here is grass and horses  They abandoned it   

WEST PALM BEACH  Fla    The Chinese woman who was arrested after gaining entry to President Trump s private club while carrying four cellphones and other electronic equipment had stored even more electronics in her hotel room  including a device used to detect hidden cameras  a federal prosecutor said Monday The woman  Yujing Zhang  32  was arrested March 30 after telling Secret Service agents that she had come to use the pool at Mar a Lago and showing two Chinese passports  After the authorities determined that the event she said she had come to attend did not exist  she was arrested and charged with lying to a federal officer and accessing a restricted area Ms  Zhang had entered the property with four cellphones  a hard drive and a thumb drive infected with malware  according to federal court records  Upon searching her hotel room  investigators found another cellphone and a radio frequency device that detects hidden cameras  Assistant United States Attorney Rolando Garcia said She also had nine U S B  drives and five SIM cards in her room at the Colony Hotel  along with several debit cards and about  8 000 in cash  including about  700 in Chinese currency  Mr  Garcia said during a bond hearing at the U S  District Court in West Palm Beach Mr  Garcia told U S  Magistrate Judge William Matthewman that Ms  Zhang is a  serious flight risk  because she  lies to everyone that she encounters  She told authorities at the club that she had carried multiple phones to the resort because she was afraid to leave them in her hotel room  Mr  Garcia said  She told the court in an appearance last week that she had only about  5 000 in the bank  Someone who is afraid of her property being stolen at the hotel does not leave so much cash and credit cards in a hotel room   Mr  Garcia said Ms  Zhang came to the United States on March 28 from Shanghai on a B 1 visa that has been revoked  meaning that if the court does release her from jail pending trial  she would be transferred to immigration custody  Mr  Garcia said  She has really no ties to the Southern District of Florida  or the United States of America  for that matter   he said Ms  Zhang s assistant federal public defender  Robert Adler  said in the court hearing that Ms  Zhang did not attempt to hide the four cellphones when she entered the club  We have heard the government has no reason to believe Ms  Zhang was a spy   Mr  Adler said The Secret Service agent who questioned Ms  Zhang after her arrest  Samuel Ivanovich  said during testimony that she was not carrying any lock picking or eavesdropping gear  His four and a half hour interrogation of Ms  Zhang was recorded by video  Mr  Ivanovich said  but it lacked sound because he didn t realize that the agency s office in Palm Beach didn t have that capability Mr  Ivanovich testified that the computer analyst who reviewed Ms  Zhang s devices said that the thumb drive she was carrying had immediately begun installing malware  He stated that he had to immediately stop the analysis and shut off his computer to halt the corruption   Mr  Ivanovich said At her initial court appearance last week  Ms  Zhang told a judge that she was an investor and a consultant for a company called Shanghai Zhirong Asset Management  according to a recording of the court hearing obtained by CNN  and had a home in China worth  1 3 million and a BMW  No one at the company could be reached to confirm her employment When she was questioned by the authorities  Ms  Zhang told them she had been invited to an event at Mar a Lago by a friend named Charles whom she knew from an instant messaging app  The information she gave appears to match a man named Charles Lee  who runs a group called the United Nations Chinese Friendship Association Mr  Lee appears to have been promoting a charity event at Mar a Lago  advertising it as a business event for Chinese investors  The real event  a  safari night  to benefit a local youth group  had been canceled weeks earlier  Mr  Lee did not return repeated messages seeking comment Mr  Adler said his client had wired  20 000 to what he believes is Mr  Lee s organization in order to visit Florida and have access to Mr  Trump s family  He provided the court with a receipt  printed in Chinese  and said he plans to subpoena Mr  Lee to support his client s story  What did she do that was wrong   Mr  Adler said   What she did was the equivalent of saying   My name is Smith  I d like to use the pool   The judge postponed a decision on whether to release Ms  Zhang on bond until next Monday  Prosecutors said a more detailed indictment would be filed before then  

For a two hour stretch in a packed Times Square hotel ballroom on Friday morning  the full spectrum of the Democratic Party s stances on racism and racial justice was on display Kamala Harris  the California senator who is seeking to become the first black woman to be elected president  electrified the crowd by declaring that when   not if   she s elected president she would sign a bill to study reparations for black Americans  This is an inflection moment in the history of our country   Ms  Harris said   This is a moment of time where we must restore the significance of truth and justice in this country  John Hickenlooper  a former governor of Colorado  and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  said they would also support such a bill  Mr  Hickenlooper s backing showed how even the most moderate members of the Democratic Party have now adopted the explicit language of racial justice activists  and how the issue of reparations continues to roil the 2020 Democratic primary in ways that few could predict  Slavery is the nagging shame of America   Mr  Hickenlooper said   We must own our past and acknowledge the ongoing consequences of enslaving an entire race of people  ImageRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  Democrat of New York  received a rousing welcome at the National Action Network conference on Friday CreditGabriella Angotti Jones for The New York TimesSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also addressed a group that included civil rights activists and black religious leaders  We must take on the disparity within the disparity  the racial disparities which exist in this country  which are growing wider and wider   Mr  Sanders said The candidates appeared at the annual conference of the National Action Network  the advocacy group founded by the Rev  Al Sharpton  which has become an essential event for Democrats seeking higher office  For the candidates  it was a prime opportunity to speak directly to an influential segment of the black voting bloc that will be a force in next year s presidential primaries  particularly in early voting states such as South Carolina In addition to Ms  Harris  Mr  Hickenlooper  Mr  Sanders and Ms  Warren  the early slate of the conference included speeches from Sherrod Brown  the Ohio senator who declined to run for president  and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  the freshman House member from New York who instantly made an impact on Capitol Hill  We can t sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behind   said Ms  Warren  who used her speech to back another progressive policy idea  the elimination of the Senate filibuster Ms  Warren has sought to boost a campaign that has struggled with fund raising by proposing an expansive policy agenda  On Friday she tried to position her ambitious filibuster position as essential  because Republicans would block most progressive legislation aimed at closing the racial wealth gap Image We can t sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behind   Senator Elizabeth Warren said CreditGabriella Angotti Jones for The New York Times We can t sit around for 100 years while climate change destroys our planet  while corruption pervades every nook and cranny of Washington  and while too much of a child s fate in life still rests on the color of their skin   Ms  Warren said   Enough with that  Ms  Harris  who enjoyed an assumed kinship with the audience because of her identity and historic candidacy  said she would double the size of the Justice Department s Civil Rights Division and focus on white nationalist domestic terrorism  The most liberal candidates  including Mr  Sanders and Ms  Warren  focused their speeches on structural injustices  and how a progressive president could use the power of the federal government to improve historically distressed communities The roster of candidates was a who s who of prominent Democrats  and similarly powerful figures were scheduled to speak later in the day  Presidential candidates from the Senate  including Cory Booker of New Jersey  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York  participated in an afternoon forum with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  Earlier in the week  Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Julin Castro and Beto O Rourke both of Texas also spoke to the largely black audience  Let s call it like it is    Mr  Booker said   Right now in America  we ve come to the distraught present that there are more black men under criminal supervision in our country than all the slaves of 1850  But it was Ms  Ocasio Cortez  the newly elected representative who has become a leader of the party s progressive faction and a favorite target of conservatives  who received a hero s welcome before her remarks  She framed the fight against racism as more than a byproduct of modern political polarization  but a struggle baked into the American story that must be prioritized  She invoked the anniversary on Thursday of the assassination of the Rev  Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr   and the crowd roared in approval  I find so much of this present moment to be a picking up  a revival  of where King left off   Ms  Ocasio Cortez said  before being played off to James Brown   Bigotry  sexism  and xenophobia are the easiest ways to distract from substantive discussions of classism   

The federal government wants to issue more visas for foreign workers to take temporary jobs in housekeeping  landscaping and other fields   even as President Trump seeks to seal off the border with Mexico  where most of those workers come from The Departments of Homeland Security and Labor said they planned to issue up to 30 000 additional H 2B visas through Sept  30  the end of the federal fiscal year  Congress has generally capped the number of visas  which businesses compete for  at 66 000  divided evenly between summer and winter seasons Only workers who had previously secured the visas would be eligible for the proposed additional ones The visas provide legal status for immigrants in temporary nonfarm jobs with landscaping companies  restaurants  hotels and amusement parks  among other industries Last fiscal year  about 75 percent of these visas were issued to workers from Mexico  according to State Department data  Visas were also issued to  among others  Jamaicans  Guatemalans and South Africans Business groups regularly push lawmakers to raise or eliminate the cap on the number of visas issued  a demand that has increased as unemployment has dropped and domestic workers have become more scarce The government s move to expand the H 2B program appeared inconsistent with the Trump administration s repeated message about a crisis on the southwestern border of the United States  On Saturday  Mr  Trump told a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition that  our country s full   What can we do  We can t handle any more   he said   Our country s full  You can t come in  I m sorry  Alex Nowrasteh  a senior immigration analyst with the Cato Institute  a libertarian think tank  said there were  a lot of contradictions  within the government s proposals  On one hand  we need more people because the economy is booming   he said   Then on the other hand  to say   The country is full  go back    it s impossible to reconcile those  The H 2B visa program  which started in the mid 20th century  has been a feature of a persistent debate over using foreign workers for seasonal labor Unions and immigration opponents argue that hiring H 2B workers suppresses wages and deprives Americans of jobs  Advocacy groups say foreign workers are often exploited  and employers say the cap encourages businesses to hire undocumented workers Andrea Palermo  a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security  did not directly answer questions about what was behind the plan for additional H 2B visas  She also did not address questions about the apparent contradiction in the administration s positions  Congress   not D H S    should be responsible for determining whether the annual numerical limitations for H 2B workers set by Congress need to be modified  and by how much  and for setting parameters to ensure that enough workers are available to meet employers  temporary needs throughout the year   she said The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday Mr  Nowrasteh said he favored the H 2B program   I think the economic benefits from the H 2B visa are very large  the benefits to the workers are huge   he said Because businesses are required to show that no American workers want the jobs  the cap  makes no sense   he said  If they try to hire Americans  and Americans don t want to do that job  then there should be no cap   he said Mr  Nowrasteh said he believed that H 2B visas for Mexican workers have helped drive down illegal immigration  He said expanding the program or eliminating the cap could also help reduce the number of undocumented immigrants from Central American countries Last month a bipartisan group of senators  led by Susan M  Collins and Angus S  King of Maine  asked the Department of Homeland Security to increase the number of visas as a way to support small businesses in a tight labor market  especially those preparing for the summer season  In the short run  many areas of our country simply lack the working age population needed to meet the demand for seasonal jobs   the senators wrote in a letter signed by 11 lawmakers   In some industries  particularly tourism  we fear that the demand for workers so far outstrips the available supply that businesses could be forced to curtail operations  putting at risk the jobs of American workers who fill year round positions at these establishments  But Mark Krikorian  the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies  which supports curbs on immigration  was critical of the program and said it enabled  businesses to avoid hiring people they d rather not hire   A nation with a third of a billion spanning an entire continent  with 50 million working age people not in the labor force  doesn t need to be importing labor   he said Mr  Krikorian said the proposed expansion of the program was not  backtracking or flip flopping  by the administration  The president has always been a big fan of these guest worker visas   said Mr  Krikorian  who noted that Mr  Trump s properties  such as Mar a Lago  use this visa program to hire workers  

WASHINGTON   Senator Bernie Sanders stepped to the lectern on Wednesday  red faced and rumpled as ever  with a placard screaming  Medicare for All   and likened his quest for a government run universal health plan to earlier movements for women s rights  civil rights  workers  rights and gay rights  What we are involved in is not just health care legislation   he declared  flanked by admiring doctors in lab coats  Democratic senators and one of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York   We are involved in a great struggle  Medicare for All is not passing this Congress  Its cost is still unknown  the mechanisms to pay for it still the subject of debate  But behind Mr  Sanders s choreographed theatrics were the unmistakable politics of 2020 and his campaign for president  a campaign that never really ended with the election of Donald J  Trump After the 2016 election  Democrats made efforts to pull Mr  Sanders  a political independent from Vermont  into the fold with a newly minted leadership post  But that has only bolstered his platform to seek the presidency   and gave him more power to disrupt the party s status quo VideoSenator Bernie Sanders is embarking on a second run for president  This time the field will be bigger  more diverse and filled with candidates who have adopted his progressive populist mantle CreditCreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times I ran for president  I got 13 million votes  going over 1 700 delegates to the Democratic convention  and got more young people s votes than Clinton and Trump combined   Mr  Sanders boasted in an interview in his Washington office   And I thought that those 13 million people deserved a voice in Democratic leadership  The Medicare for All Act unveiling   its fifth iteration   comes as Mr  Sanders s  18 million fund raising haul has made him an instant front runner in a very crowded field  But in many ways he is still the  same old Bernie   as many of his colleagues like to say   a gruff and sometimes grating presence in a chamber that prides itself on civility  He still knows how to rankle He ran as a Democrat for president in 2016  then shunned the entreaties of Democratic leaders and sought re election last year as an independent  His push for Medicare for All runs counter to the wishes of top Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer  the minority leader  and Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who are trying to de emphasize it At the same time  Mr  Sanders   who has long cast himself as an outsider   has joined party leadership  which gives him a voice in plotting strategy  His post as  chair of outreach    a job that did not exist until he and Mr  Schumer created it after the 2016 presidential election   has also given him license and a small budget to travel the country doing what he likes best  rallying the progressive left to resist President Trump Image I ran for president  I got 13 million votes  going over 1 700 delegates to the Democratic convention  and got more young people s votes than Clinton and Trump combined   Mr  Sanders boasted in an interview in his Washington office CreditErin Schaff The New York Times Bernie Sanders  now a millionaire  pledges to release tax returns by Monday  More than a half dozen members of Congress are running for president  but few have used their seats as adroitly as Mr  Sanders to burnish a brand  He announced his candidacy in 2015 on a patch of grass  known as the Swamp  outside the Capitol   an unusual locale given that senators are not supposed to mix official business with politics Not long after the 2016 campaign  when some moderate Democrats worried he would help foster primary challenges against them  he brought his chief strategist  Jeff Weaver  to meet behind closed doors with his colleagues to tutor them on how to appeal to his millennial base He went on CNN to debate tax policy with Senator Ted Cruz  Republican of Texas  He held dozens of rallies in 2017 to whip up opposition to Mr  Trump s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act  I think he feeds off these crowds  there s no question about it   said Larry Cohen  chairman of Our Revolution  the organization that spun out of Mr  Sanders s 2016 campaign  Mr  Cohen added that Mr  Schumer realized there was  a huge benefit  to bringing on Mr  Sanders   You don t just bring him back after that kind of relative success and just treat him as the junior senator from Vermont  How  Medicare for All  Would Affect YouBernie Sanders s proposal has big implications for consumers and the health care industry Mr  Sanders also staked out policy crusades to address concerns that arose during his 2016 campaign  Criticized for lacking foreign policy experience  he teamed with two Republicans   Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky   to pass a resolution calling for an end to American military involvement in Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen  He also embraced a criminal justice overhaul after being accused of not being sensitive enough to issues of racial injustice He shrewdly hired the Democratic operative Tyson Brody  who compiled opposition research on him for Hillary Clinton s campaign in 2016  Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and a co chairman of Mr  Sanders s 2020 campaign  calls Mr  Sanders  the perfect insider outsider  who  unlike Mr  Trump  at least knows how Washington works The last time he embarked on a run for the White House  in April 2015  Mr  Sanders  was viewed by his colleagues as a kind of oddball figure   a self identified democratic socialist on a Don Quixote  tilting at windmills quest  I think people should be a little bit careful underestimating me   he said then Now the senator has a different problem  So many Democrats sound so much like Bernie Sanders that some are asking why America needs Bernie Sanders  His Medicare for All bill is a case in point  Its co sponsors include at least four Senate Democrats who are running against him  Ms  Gillibrand  Cory Booker of New Jersey  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California ImageMr  Sanders this month at a campaign rally in Davenport  Iowa  Democratic efforts to pull Mr  Sanders into the fold with a newly minted leadership post have helped bolster his presidential bid CreditJordan Gale for The New York TimesBut in planting a political stake in the ground with Medicare for All  Mr  Sanders is effectively challenging his Democratic rivals to follow suit  which could come back to haunt whomever is chosen as the party s nominee  said David Krone  a former chief of staff to Harry Reid  the former Senate Democratic leader  I m very concerned that his campaign is creating a litmus test for other candidates and that s a dangerous path   Mr  Krone said The Medicare for All Act would provide health insurance to all Americans under a single plan run by the government and financed by taxpayers  private insurers could remain in business but could only provide benefits  such as elective surgery  not covered by the government  The 2019 version includes coverage for long term care  perhaps increasing its appeal but also its cost The rollout   complete with Sanders esque finger jabs and talk of  doctahs  and  dollahs    was live streamed from a packed room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building  After Mr  Sanders poked Mr  Trump  the president s press secretary  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  no relation   poked back  denouncing  self proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders  for  proposing a total government takeover of health care  Would  Medicare for All  Save Billions or Cost Billions We asked a handful of economists and think tanks to find out The plan s main drawback   and one that alarms many moderate Democrats and Democratic leadership   is the cost  as high as  32 trillion over 10 years  according to two different studies  But the Sanders camp cites various other studies  including one by the RAND Corporation  to back up its assertion that Medicare for All would save middle class families money by decreasing their premiums and out of pocket costs As to why America needs Bernie Sanders  Mr  Sanders s answer is simple  He was there first  Find out how many folks in the 1980s were going up to Canada to learn about Medicare for All   he said  adding   In 1999  I took a busload of Vermonters across the Canadian border to purchase low cost prescription drugs in Canada  O K   I was the first member of Congress to do that  So are other people talking about the greed of the pharmaceutical industry  Yes  Check out who was there first  He also took a subtle swipe at another of his competitors  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  Of her idea for a trillion dollar infrastructure plan  he said   Well  we were talking about that how many years ago  2015  Ms  Klobuchar then swiped back   While a big infrastructure plan has been kicked around for years  I can get it done   she wrote in an email message Mr  Sanders has always been a scowling presence in the Senate  He plows through the Capitol corridors  always too busy to talk  stingy with his smiles    If you worked here  you wouldn t smile either   he said  His official website offers a hint of where the job falls on his priority list  Until Wednesday  after this article pointed it out  it had not been updated to reflect his re election in 2018 and still said he was  serving his second term after winning re election in 2012  He is thinner these days  having dropped 10 pounds on no particular diet   or at least none that he cares to share    By not eating   he said  when asked how he did it   And though his  national support has given Bernie more credibility   in the words of Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the No  2 Democrat  his colleagues say not much has changed  He s Bernie   said Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia  who ran for vice president alongside Mrs  Clinton after she defeated Mr  Sanders for the 2016 Democratic nomination   Whether that s running or just being Bernie  he kind of does what he does   

WASHINGTON   The Justice Department has begun putting a key aspect of last year s sweeping bipartisan criminal justice overhaul into effect  after delays prompted in part by the partial government shutdown and turnover at the top of the department Attorney General William P  Barr said on Monday that the department had chosen the Hudson Institute  a conservative research group  to host an independent review committee to help law enforcement officials create tools to reduce recidivism and programs for prisoners to earn credits toward early release Critics noted that the attorney general was supposed to designate a committee host within 30 days of the passage of the law  the First Step Act  in late December But putting the law into practice quickly became complicated  The government partly shut down one day after Congress passed the bill and sent it to President Trump to sign into law  and many of the Justice Department employees who would have worked to fulfill it went on furlough  The shutdown  the longest in history  lasted through the end of January That has given law enforcement officials just over two months to start carrying out a complicated piece of legislation  a senior Justice Department official said in defending their pace The legislation swept in the most substantial changes in a generation to sentencing laws that expanded the federal inmate population and created a criminal justice system that many conservatives and liberals viewed as both costly and unfair  The law expands job training and other efforts aimed at reducing recidivism rates  expands early release programs and modifies sentencing laws  Understandably  there have been some gray areas that have needed to be interpreted  but over all  the implementation has been slow   said Brett Tolman  a former United States attorney in Utah and an advocate for criminal justice reform   It s surprising because when the law was passed  it was very clear that the proponents of the legislation did not intend it to be delayed  The criminal justice overhaul was also passed during intense tumult at the top of the Justice Department  which oversees the Bureau of Prisons and would be responsible for carrying out much of the new legislation  In the weeks before the bill was passed  Mr  Trump forced Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign and replaced him on an interim basis with Matthew G  Whitaker  Mr  Sessions s chief of staff Democrats criticized the appointment  pointing to Mr  Whitaker s lack of experience and questions about possible conflicts of interest  as well as whether Mr  Trump was installing a loyalist to oversee the end of the Russia investigation  By the time Mr  Trump signed the criminal justice legislation in late December  Mr  Trump had nominated Mr  Barr  leaving Mr  Whitaker with little influence to spearhead a new initiative Mr  Sessions  who has long held a tough on crime approach  opposed the criminal justice overhaul  and while he was attorney general and Mr  Whitaker his top aide  the Justice Department was seen as hostile to much of the bill  according to three people who worked on it but were not authorized to discuss confidential negotiations Mr  Sessions spent much of his career as a federal prosecutor and senator from Alabama pushing for harsher sentencing guidelines  and many of the sheriffs and the police who were his biggest supporters disliked the legislation  Mr  Sessions  who ordered prosecutors to pursue tough charges in criminal cases as one of his first major acts as attorney general  was seen as a roadblock to getting a deal done in Congress The legislation changed sentencing laws  prompting 800 sentencing reductions already  according to the Justice Department  Of that group  nearly 650 inmates have been released from prison Another 22 inmates have received sentencing reductions under a compassionate release program that is part of the law  Last month  a federal judge in Houston ordered the Bureau of Prisons to give Richard Evans  74  who has cancer  compassionate release under the law  Mr  Evans was 22 months into a five year sentence for health care fraud Mr  Trump has touted the criminal justice overhaul as one of his major achievements  and he hosted a celebration this month at the White House to honor the legislation  

MELBOURNE  Australia   When vegan activists halted morning traffic on Monday at one of Australia s busiest intersections  Prime Minister Scott Morrison described their actions as  un Australian  The traffic disruption in Melbourne was part of a  Day of Action  protesting the consumption of animal products  during which activists also chained themselves to machinery at an abattoir and blockaded a gas chamber at a pig farm All the activists wanted  they said  was for the public to watch  Dominion    a two hour documentary narrated by the American actor Joaquin Phoenix and released last year that claims to expose the routine and inhumane practices of animal agriculture in Australia  We believe people have the right to see what s happening so that they can make decisions   said Chris Delforce  the film s writer and director and the head of an animal liberation group called Aussie Farms  which led the protests   They are funding cruelty   he said of Australians who buy animal products Mr  Delforce said that YouTube views of the film had  skyrocketed  since the protests on Monday  in which 40 people were arrested But the group s actions have also exposed a rift in Australian society between animal rights activists and farmers  who inject more than 60 billion Australian dollars  or  43 billion  into the country s economy per year  Farmers say their right to privacy and their ability to run their businesses have been undermined by the activists  who have posted a map online of farmers  addresses and contact details  trespassed on private property and even stolen animals  We saw it as an attack on Australian farming   said Tony Mahar  chief executive of the National Farmers  Federation  Mr  Mahar described the activists as  malicious  and  militant  extremists who had bullied law abiding citizens and used footage selectively in the film to further their aims The Australian government has sided with the farmers  promising to support any who want to bring a lawsuit over the protest actions In the United States  similar actions by animal rights activists have resulted in  ag gag laws  criminalizing covert investigations of farms  which activists say keep cruel practices concealed from the public  Experts say the Australian government is showing signs of moving in the same direction The protests around Australia have also raised questions about vigilante action and its consequences  One goat farm says it was forced to close by sustained bullying    Our staff and customers have been subjected to nearly four months of constant harassment  vile statements and threats from the abusive vegan activists   the Gippy Goat Cafe said in a Facebook post on Sunday   The courts have proven to be ineffectual  the enforcement agencies declined to prosecute to the full extent  so  to the thieves  trespassers and activists  you have won   Farmers and government officials say they are concerned about violence In February  activists circulated footage of a dairy farmer in the state of Western Australia firing his shotgun into the air while they were in a car filming his property  although the gun is pointed away from the car and the farmer has said he did not know they were there  Brendan Farrell  a cattle farmer who runs a group that donates hay to farmers affected by drought  said he worried that if the trespassing continued  someone might get killed   They re going to go on the wrong person s property somewhere in this country where someone has had a gutful   he said   The writing is on the wall   Mr  Delforce said he and other activists were willing to endure the risks to expose what he says is an opaque and inhumane system that he believes would sicken Australian consumers   Most Australians are opposed to animal cruelty   he said  In recent years  the vegan movement has also gained traction in Australia because of increased awareness of animal agriculture s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions  which cause  climate change  Approximately 11 percent of Australian adults eat a mostly or completely vegetarian diet  a proportion that has slowly but steadily risen  according to a 2016 study   A growing concern about animal welfare issues  as well as over environmental impacts  has led many people to change their diets to include fewer to no animal products   said Gyorgy Scrinis  a senior lecturer in food politics and policy at the University of Melbourne   This is no longer a fringe movement   he said Nonetheless  Australia continues to rank among the top meat eating countries in the world  and it is also a major exporter of animal products to countries like China  said Mr  Mahar of the National Farmers  Federation   Developing countries are wanting protein   he said  adding that  while there s a market and a strong market for animal production  then that s what the farmers will grow  While some ridiculed the protesters on Twitter  describing their actions as ineffective and pushing them further toward carnivorism  others said their minds had been opened  Today s vegan protest totally worked on me   Meshel Laurie  an Australian radio and television presenter  wrote on Facebook  Ms  Laurie said she had been  shamed  by the activists who had worked hard to get Australians to consider the issue   I was stuck in traffic in my car  late for work   she wrote   and all I could think was   They re right  I have got to stop eating meat   Want more Australia coverage and discussion  Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter  start your day with your local Morning Briefing

It was a paroxysm that inscribed new chapters in the annals of genocide and turned a spotlight on the failure of international peacekeepers to come anywhere close to living up to their name Twenty five years ago  on April 7  1994  the dominant Hutus of Rwanda turned with well planned violence on the Tutsi minority whom they held to be traitors  One hundred days later  when the killing finally stopped  the death toll stood at as many as one million  mostly Tutsis but also including some moderate Hutus who had opposed the bloodletting  For more stories about the experiences and costs of war  sign up for the weekly At War newsletter  The scale of the fatalities was shocking  but more was to come as the torrent of killings washed into the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo  igniting years of strife in Africa s Great Lakes region  And  along this bloodstained way  sexual violence became woven into the horrors of war  Women suffered untold rapes and gang rapes  accelerating the spread of AIDS  The offspring of these assaults were stigmatized as  children of the killers  ImageA Hutu man whose face was mutilated by the Hutu Interahamwe militia  who suspected him of

the same year in which Nelson Mandela was installed as South Africa s first black president   the very emblem of a continent s hope and triumph over adversity   Africa was also in the public eye for cataclysmic anarchy and violence But Africa had no monopoly on blame The United States  scarred by the killing and humiliation of its soldiers in Somalia during the Battle of Mogadishu a few months earlier  had no appetite to intervene  President Bill Clinton  who was in office as the killings unfolded half a world away  said years later during a visit to Rwanda   I don t think we could have ended the violence  but I think we could have cut it down  And I regret it  France  a significant player in French speaking Africa  has long faced charges that it supported the Hutu leadership before and even during the massacres  President Paul Kagame of Rwanda has called French soldiers  actors  in the genocide   a charge denied by the former French prime minister  douard Balladur  as  a self interested lie   But on Friday  President Emmanuel Macron of France ordered a two year government study of France s role in the Rwandan genocide ImagePaul Kagame  left  the leader of the Tutsi led

commander  the Canadian Maj  Gen  Romo Dallaire  to raid a Hutu arms cache that had been set aside for use in the atrocities  At the time  Kofi Annan  who later became the secretary general of the United Nations  was in charge of peacekeeping operations  Years later he said of the killing   All of us must bitterly regret that we did not do more to prevent it  History suggests  however  that Rwanda s lessons were an insufficient deterrent  Just a year after the Rwandan genocide  events far away in Europe   in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica   offered another alarming example of the toxic combination of genocidal urges and United Nations caution  8 000 Bosnian Muslims were murdered despite the presence of Dutch peacekeepers And  for its part  an African panel found many culprits for

inspecting the wreckage of a plane crash that killed the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi in April 1994 CreditCorinne Dufka ReutersThe ostensible trigger for the genocide came on April 6  1994  when an airplane carrying the country s Hutu president  Juvenal Habyarimana  and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighboring Burundi was shot down as it approached Kigali  Rwanda s capital  It has never been clearly established who brought the plane down or whether the genocide had been planned well in advance and needed only a spark to ignite its lethal tinder But within hours  the killing had started  Elite government forces  supported by a dreaded Hutu militia  the Interahamwe  which translates roughly as  those who work together   rounded up and executed Tutsi military and political leaders  Roadblocks were thrown up to filter out Rwandans whose official ID tagged them as Tutsis   a distinction introduced in the 1930s by the Belgian colonial authorities  Like their imperial German predecessors  Belgian officials had favored a Tutsi elite until the Hutu majority rose up in 1959 In rural areas  where Hutus and Tutsis had intermingled and sometimes intermarried  pervasive government propaganda in radio broadcasts and newspaper articles urged Hutus to take any weapon they could find   machetes  clubs   to kill or maim their neighbors  Foreigners working in the country were evacuated  but not their Rwandan staff  People were massacred in churches and homes  fields and roadside ditches  stadiums and checkpoints ImageA refugee camp in Tanzania in 1994  near the border

skulls of victims stacked in rows In 1994  the genocide also ruptured a cease fire in a civil war that had been raging since 1990 between government forces and insurgents from the Rwanda Patriotic Front  led by the Tutsi Mr  Kagame  who was to become Rwanda s president  The Patriotic Front launched a broad attack to take the capital  Kigali  in early July  The killing in Rwanda itself came to a halt  but not the ethnic recriminations  With the land ruined  crops untended and the population diminished by the killing of Tutsis and the subsequent flight of Hutu refugees into Congo  Rwanda entered a new  gradually prospering but ambiguous era  The following years raised questions about post genocide justice and the price Rwandans paid for well being and stability under Mr  Kagame ImageA

 including Mr  Clinton and Bill Gates  His cities boasted clean streets and low crime  His economy grew rapidly  Admirers compared him to Lee Kuan Yew  the Singaporean leader who fused authoritarian rule with prosperity And  as Mr  Kagame s regime grew ever more entrenched and ever more intolerant of dissent  he often got a pass   Western states that did nothing to prevent the massacres have treated Rwanda with kid gloves ever since  in part out of a frequently acknowledged sense of guilt   the author and journalist Michela Wrong wrote in The Guardian Mr  Kagame was limited to two terms in office  but like his regional peers in Uganda  Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo   and rulers much farther afield   he chafed at the restriction  A referendum in 2015 changed the Constitution  enabling him to remain in office until 2034  In elections in 2017 he won with a staggering 98 8 percent of the vote   Of his two major opponents  Diane Rwigara was disqualified  later to be jailed  and Victoire Ingabire was already in prison  ImageA Rwandan confronting an inmate in a session for detainees who were accused of crimes committed during the genocide CreditMarco Longari

found murdered in a luxury hotel in Johannesburg  although the government in Kigali has denied suggestions that it was behind the killing In 2014  as Rwanda marked the 20th anniversary of the genocide  an editorial in The New York Times hailed the country as  an island of order and relative prosperity in a poor and politically volatile region  But  listing a tally of restrictions on civil and political rights  including detentions and torture  disappearances and killings  the article concluded   Addressing the poisonous legacies of Rwanda s genocide is the only way to avert future tragedy

WASHINGTON   Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  resigned on Sunday after meeting with President Trump  ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the border security agency that had made her the target of the president s criticism  I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside   Ms  Nielsen said in a resignation letter   I hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse  Ms  Nielsen had requested the meeting to plan  a way forward  at the border  in part thinking she could have a reasoned conversation with Mr  Trump about the role  according to three people familiar with the meeting  She came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president Mr  Trump in recent weeks had asked Ms  Nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers  which Ms  Nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate  While the 30 minute meeting was cordial  Mr  Trump was determined to ask for her resignation  After the meeting  she submitted it ImageListen to  The Daily   The Brief  Controversial Tenure of Kirstjen NielsenAs homeland security secretary  she enacted and publicly defended the family separation policy  In President Trump s eyes  she didn t go far enough transcriptBack to The Dailybars0 00 26 23 26 23transcriptListen to  The Daily   The Brief  Controversial Tenure of Kirstjen NielsenHosted by Michael Barbaro  produced by Rachel Quester  Jessica Cheung and Eric Krupke  and edited by Paige CowettAs homeland security secretary  she enacted and publicly defended the family separation policy  In President Trump s eyes  she didn t go far enough michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  The secretary of homeland security was forced out of her job  even after carrying out and defending President Trump s most restrictive immigration policies  Why that wasn t enough  It s Tuesday  April 9  Caitlin  describe what happened over the weekend caitlin dickersonSo on Sunday  Kirstjen Nielsen  who s the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security   she s the nation s highest ranking immigration officer   she goes to the White House for an unscheduled meeting with President Trump michael barbaroCaitlin Dickerson covers immigration for The Times caitlin dickersonAnd he  in recent weeks  has been very riled up publicly over an increasing number of people crossing the border  especially families who seek asylum who have legal protections that mean they have to be allowed into the country  So the secretary arrives at her meeting with a list of ideas for how to address this problem  and she thinks she and the president are going to come up with a way forward  But instead  a few hours later  the president sends a tweet announcing that she will be leaving her job archived recording 1Breaking news here on CNN  From the White House  the secretary of homeland security  Kirstjen Nielsen  has resigned archived recording 2President Trump made the announcement via Twitter archived recording 3In a tweet  the president said  quote   Secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position  and I would like to thank her for her service  archived recording 4So it appears that the president is swinging the revolving door yet again  trying to install new people in his administration to carry out his bidding michael barbaroThat sounds like a meeting that went very poorly for the secretary caitlin dickersonClearly  they were not able to come up with a solution that both could agree on michael barbaroAnd by tweeting her resignation  I think what we re politely suggesting is that he fired her caitlin dickersonFired her  Yes  exactly michael barbaroSo what is the history between President Trump and Secretary Nielsen caitlin dickersonSo Secretary Nielsen takes her job at the end of 2017  She s replacing her former boss  John Kelly  who went to be President Trump s chief of staff  And she takes on this role as basically the person who has to approve any new policy that s going to be introduced along the border  And it s at this period of time when  I think  the President is settling into his role  He s fired up about really coming up with some hard evidence that he can point to ahead of the midterm elections  for example  and say  look  I m keeping my campaign promises  and I m lowering immigration really dramatically  So right away  she s faced with aggressive ideas for how to prevent people from coming to the United States  and the first one is family separation michael barbaroAnd what do we know about how Nielsen responds to that very controversial policy when it is first introduced to her caitlin dickersonShe slow walks it  We reported in December of 2017 that a family separation policy had reached her desk for that final signature  and it took her four months to approve it  during which time she and President Trump clashed quite a bit  She had questions about the legality of it  She had questions about the practicality and how the public was going to respond  And she had just a lot of reservations about moving forward  But ultimately  she agreed  and the policy was introduced in a formal way in April archived recording 1Quit separating the kids  They re separating the children  Mr  President  don t you have kids  Don t you have kids  Mr  President archived recording 2I don t believe in this  This is not America  This is not our country  This is not what we should be doing archived recording  kirstjen nielsen This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border archived recordingShame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay at the other side of the border  fearing death  and allow the secretary to come here and lie archived recording  kirstjen nielsen Calling me a liar are fighting words  I m not a liar  We ve never had a policy for family separation  And let s be clear   if an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States  they would go to jail  and they would be separated from their family  This is not a controversial idea caitlin dickersonInternally  she s  if not resisting  she s certainly questioning and slowing down a lot of these policies  And then  externally  to the public  she s having to defend them and really look like the face of them  and that ends up being something that she does actually over and over again in her job michael barbaroAnd remind us what ends up happening to the family separation policy caitlin dickersonSo President Trump stopped the practice himself by signing an executive order archived recording  donald trump I consider it to be a very important executive order  It s about keeping families together caitlin dickersonBut it didn t matter  because a few days later  a federal judge intervened  deemed the practice unconstitutional  and he didn t stop there  He said that  archived recordingFamilies who have been separated as a result of the Trump administration s zero tolerance policy be reunited within 30 days  The order says kids under 5 must be back with their parents within 14 days from now caitlin dickersonSo sort of a resounding disavowal of this policy michael barbaroBy the legal system caitlin dickersonExactly  And so even though she d pushed back against it  Secretary Nielsen ends up taking the blame michael barbaroSo what s another example something that she expresses internal qualms about but then goes out and defends publicly caitlin dickersonSo one of the next policies to be introduced was an idea to limit asylum pretty significantly so that people could only apply if they showed up at a legal port of entry   whereas beforehand  people could and did very often show up anywhere along the border  present themselves to a border agency  ask for protection  and they were ushered into this legal process  The idea was to say  you can t do that anymore  You have to show up at a specific office  which is  of course  a pretty tall order for somebody who s coming from Central America with maybe a cell phone  maybe not  not a whole lot of resources  They don t always know exactly where these offices exist archived recording  kirstjen nielsen You do not need to break the law of this country by entering illegally to claim asylum  If you are seeking asylum  go to a port of entry caitlin dickersonBut as Nielsen pointed out to the president  it was very hard to justify  because immigration law explicitly says that you can request asylum regardless of where you enter michael barbaroSo again  Nielsen is saying inside the White House  hey  this might not be legal  I have reservations about it  But it nevertheless gets implemented  And as you ve said  she s the decider  So she signs off on it caitlin dickersonExactly  And it s important to point out that when Nielsen pushed back against President Trump  it wasn t a reflection of her being a liberal on immigration or having a more sympathetic view toward asylum seekers  She just happened to be the face of an entire agency full of people who work in immigration enforcement but who still made clear to her that there were going to be legal and logistical roadblocks to putting these ideas into place michael barbaroAnd what happens to that port of entry policy that would limit the number of locations that people can apply for asylum caitlin dickersonVery quickly after  it s blocked by federal courts  and it remains that way archived recordingA district court ruled that the ban conflicts with immigration law caitlin dickersonSo this was the executive branch trying to very clearly contradict laws that were approved by the legislative branch archived recordingAnd now the Supreme Court has refused to step in to unblock the ban michael barbaroSo her legal reservations are well founded  In other words  her advice to the president is correct  even if it s ignored caitlin dickersonThat s right  Her analysis is sound  because each time she is pushed back  she s been right  And these ideas have been blocked michael barbaroDo any of these policies that we re describing   family separation  limiting the locations at which people can seek asylum   do any of them succeed in curbing the flow of migrants  even for the very short period of time that they re in place before they are legally challenged caitlin dickersonThey don t archived recordingNew numbers show a 400 percent   4 0 0  that is   400 percent increase over just last year caitlin dickersonLast October  we saw a record number of families seek asylum in the United States  This is after family separation is introduced  And every month since then  the numbers have gotten even higher archived recordingC B P  officials say Border Patrol agents are on pace for apprehensions and encounters with more than 100 000 migrants in March michael barbaroSo not only are these policies being blocked in court  for the very short bit of time that they were ever in place  they re not doing their job of limiting the flow of migrants caitlin dickersonThey re not  The numbers keep going up  And some people would argue that maybe the policies weren t left in place for long enough to show any concrete outcome  and we can t know that for sure  But what we do know is that these policies that Nielsen was pushing back on  saying they re not going to work  didn t work  And the numbers have continued to rise michael barbaroAnd so what does that do to the president s relationship to Nielsen  She s in a sense being vindicated  but the problem she s there to solve is only getting worse caitlin dickersonShe s simultaneously sort of being vindicated if you look at it from a legal standpoint  but from a relationship standpoint  she s the face  in President Trump s eyes  of these failures archived recording 1Kirstjen Nielsen appears to be on shaky ground  That s according to a New York Times report  Nielsen told colleagues that she was close to resigning Wednesday after being berated by the president in front of the entire cabinet archived recording 2Nothing sets him off more than immigration  and I m told that meeting on Wednesday in the cabinet room was very heated  was incredibly heated  She spoke back to him about it  tried to defend herself caitlin dickersonSo it s in this context of the policies that are being introduced being blocked in the courts  the number of people crossing the border rising  and Trump s relationship with Secretary Nielsen falling apart that he comes up with his most aggressive idea yet archived recordingAnother day  another threat from President Trump  and today  he is threatening to shut down the southern border caitlin dickersonWhere he wants to completely seal the border  100 percent  Not let anybody come into the U S archived recording  donald trump And if they don t stop them  we re closing the border  We ll close it  and we ll keep it closed for a long time  I m not playing games michael barbaroAnd how exactly would that work caitlin dickersonWell  we shouldn t assume that the president had any particular policy in his mind when he tweeted that he wanted to seal the border  We can assume  though  that he wasn t talking about  for example  cargo moving back and forth or people with actual visas and permission to come into the United States  but really that he s talking about shutting down asylum and shutting down the ability of people who don t previously have permission to come into the United States  And the policy that we know has come closest to achieving that goal  one that s been kicking around in Washington for some months now  would be to get rid of asylum as we know it  It would no longer allow anyone to apply for asylum in the United States  And instead  people who needed that status or wanted that status would have to stay in their home country  similar to the way that Syrian refugees apply to come to the United States   apply from home  wait many months  go through lots of vetting and background checks  and then only if they re approved  they would be allowed to come here michael barbaroAnd I guess  what could be a more extreme version of limiting asylum than literally telling people  you cannot come to this country and apply for asylum caitlin dickersonI don t think there is a more extreme version  because I think this idea means eliminating asylum  It goes away michael barbaroAnd as best we understand it  what was Secretary Nielsen s response to this idea caitlin dickersonFrom what we know  it s been very similar to the way she reacted to family separation  to that idea to significantly limit asylum to the ports of entry  which is that this is going to be challenged by the courts immediately  It s going to be a huge lift to get a policy like this introduced  to work out the logistics  and all of it will be for naught  because it ll be enjoined by the courts  And it s that oppositional and resistant stance that she s in when she walks into the White House for her meeting with the president  It s unclear who threw up their hands first or second  or whether they both did it  but what we know is that the president did not leave her with an option  that he  at least  decided this isn t going to work  You re out  And she was by the end of that night  And so what that means is the homeland security secretary who oversaw some of the most controversial and aggressive immigration policies this country has ever seen   even she wasn t aggressive enough for President Trump  And so now she s gone  and he s looking for a replacement who will go even further michael barbaroWe ll be right back  So Caitlin  who is the president turning to to replace Nielsen as he looks for somebody to go further than she was willing to go caitlin dickersonHe s turning to Kevin McAleenan  who s currently the head of United States Customs and Border Protection  That s the agency that oversees both the customs officers who you meet at the airport when you ve gone on vacation abroad and then the Border Patrol  Those are the police  the boots on the ground along the border  And McAleenan is known as sort of a policy wonk  a really smart and reasonable guy who s willing to work with Democrats  and somebody who served under President Obama as well  He s got more than 10 years of experience at the agency  People know him as this reasonable guy  But when you dig a little bit deeper  McAleenan was inspired to get into homeland security work right after 9 11  And at C B P   especially most recently when he was overseeing this agency  it really became known as the sort of policy engine with him at the center of it coming up with ways to turn President Trump s ideas into actual policies that could be carried out  If D H S  is this agency run out of Washington that s overseeing all of this work  it was McAleenan s staff members that were actually physically taking children away from their parents  that were physically turning asylum seekers away at the border or telling them to go elsewhere or to wait in line  So now he s moving into this role where he s got even more power  but I think we can expect that he ll continue to do what he was doing before  which was take President Trump s ideas that are sort of extreme and that aren t necessarily encumbered by the immigration laws  norms  history  and he ll try to translate them into something that s practical and that can be introduced on the ground michael barbaroSo even though he might seem moderate at first glance  he s actually someone who the president trusts to put these more restrictive  maybe even extreme policies into practice  And he s been involved in doing that already  Now he s being elevated to do it at an even higher level caitlin dickersonExactly michael barbaroAnd I guess that all makes sense  If Nielsen is seen as too reluctant to put these policies into practice  then the president would turn to somebody who is willing to do that caitlin dickersonThat s right  who is willing to try  But remember that McAleenan is going to run up against the exact same legal framework and logistical challenges that anybody else in that role is going to michael barbaroRight  So if these policies are going to run into legal trouble in the courts  regardless of who is leading the agency  what does it matter  in the end  if the leader of the Department of Homeland Security is gung ho about the President s policies or is reluctantly saying yes  as Nielsen was caitlin dickersonI think you can look at that question a couple of different ways  On one hand  you re right that it s not going to make a huge difference who s sitting in the office at the head of the Homeland Security Department  because no matter what they introduce  if it violates the immigration law  they re going to wind up in court  But another way of looking at it is family separation only existed as an official sort of policy for what  45 days under zero tolerance  Not a very long period of time before it had to end  But still  I don t think that very many people are going to argue that family separation was a small thing or something that didn t affect very many people  I mean  I think it had a huge impact  So I do think that if you have a hawk running the Homeland Security Department  even when they re sort of encumbered by the existing legal framework  they can make some pretty big changes  even if  ultimately  those changes wind up in court  I think that Kevin McAleenan has two things going for him in President Trump s eyes  The first  like we said  is that he knows the policies and he knows the situation on the ground like the back of his hand  And the second thing is that he s shown a willingness to follow President Trump s lead  and so he may be the person who s best positioned to come up with the most legal ways to achieve President Trump s goals  And even if the policies that he comes up with don t remain in place in the long term  they might at least exist long enough to give President Trump something to point to and show his supporters when they ask  where are you on these campaign promises  Where are you on this idea of  if not sealing the border  significantly decreasing the number of immigrants coming to the United States michael barbaroSo even if these policies are ultimately blocked by the courts  it feels like it s important to this president to have someone at the Department of Homeland Security who is willing to try them  and that may be enough caitlin dickersonI think in President Trump s heart of hearts  right  he would hope that he would find not only somebody who is willing to try but somebody who is going to succeed  He wants aggressive policies to be instituted in the long term  But I think it s better in his mind than nothing to have somebody who s willing to try  And as we know  politically  it s better than nothing  because then the president can point to these policies that he tried to introduce  if only it wasn t for the courts who had blocked him  or if only it wasn t for Congress who blocked him michael barbaroRight  My intention was there  Somebody else is at fault for it not working caitlin dickersonExactly  He has at least an attempt to meet these campaign promises to point to when voters ask  why haven t you made a significant change  So I think that having a more aggressive leader in place who s more willing to introduce these policies  when they get stuck in the courts  it allows Trump to blame the courts rather than his own administration for getting in his way  He can say  look  I tried  but these judges are blocking me  whereas it wasn t just the judges blocking him with Secretary Nielsen  It was her  too michael barbaroIf Congress is not going to change the law  and I think the assumption is that they are not going to do that anytime soon when it comes to basic immigration law  is the president right to suggest that the current system is broken  and the only way to fix it is to test these new ideas  even if they push the boundaries of the law caitlin dickersonI would say yes to the first part of your question  Most people agree that the system is broken  But when it comes to fixing the problem  what are you trying to fix  In the president s mind  the problem is the vast number of people coming here to seek asylum  His idea of a fix would decrease that number  But other people see the problem as not that people are coming here to seek asylum at all but the ways that we re dealing with them  We don t have space to place people physically in custody when they enter  We don t have judges to hear their cases for years and years  So if you see that as the problem  then  michael barbaroHe s not really addressing those caitlin dickersonHe s not addressing those problems  and I think that s because a lot of people who agree with the president are concerned that if we come up with better systems for processing asylum seekers   we make it more organized and efficient and  in some cases  comfortable   that all that will do is encourage more and more people to come  And again  if the numbers themselves are what you see as the problem  then making the system better only makes it worse michael barbaroCaitlin  what does all of this tell us about where President Trump plans to go on immigration caitlin dickersonI think it shows that President Trump is going to continue full steam ahead to achieve his immigration goals and that if there are people  even informed career officials  who want to stand in the way of that  they re going to be pushed out  because he s very committed to the goal of limiting the number of people who come to the border  regardless of the many legal challenges he s already faced  those that are sure to come  the public reaction  all these other things notwithstanding  We re not seeing any signs of slowing down  I think this week is actually an indicator of a ramping up of these goals michael barbaroIn other words  the gloves are coming off  even though  in a lot of people s minds  they thought the gloves were already off caitlin dickersonThat s right  It s like another set of gloves are coming off michael barbaroCaitlin  thank you very much caitlin dickersonThank you michael barbaroOn Monday  The Times reported that President Trump plans to push out more officials from the Department of Homeland Security  including the department s general counsel and the director of U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  as he seeks to carry out his harder line approach to immigration  A few hours later  in the latest legal setback to that approach  a federal judge blocked a Trump administration policy that required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico rather than in the U S  while their cases made their way through U S  immigration court  The judge found that the policy violated federal law  Here s what else you need to know today archived recording  mike pompeo Today  the United States is continuing to build its maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime  I am announcing our intent to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  including its Quds Force  as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act michael barbaroOn Monday  the Trump administration said that it was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization  the first time that the U S  has classified part of any country s government as such a threat archived recording  mike pompeo We re doing it because the Iranian regime s use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government michael barbaroThe move was debated at the highest levels of the administration  with top officials at the Defense Department and the C I A  opposing the designation  arguing it could justify Iranian attacks against the U S  and its allies  But the president s national security adviser  John Bolton  and his secretary of state  Mike Pompeo  advocated for the decision  arguing the designation would further isolate Iran by discouraging businesses from working with its military archived recording  mike pompeo This historic step will deprive the world s leading state sponsor of

expressed anger at a rise in migrants at the southwestern border  withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a  tougher  direction Mr  Trump

secretary through Wednesday  in order  to assist with an orderly transition   The abruptness was unusual because the Department of Homeland Security currently does not have a deputy secretary  who would normally take the reins The president said in a tweet that Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  would take over as the acting replacement for Ms  Nielsen  who became the sixth secretary to lead the agency in late 2017  But by law  the under secretary for management  Claire Grady  who is currently serving as acting deputy secretary  is next in line to be acting secretary  The White House will have to fire her to make Mr  McAleenan acting secretary  people familiar with the transition said  Ms  Grady has told colleagues that she has no intention of resigning to make way for Mr  McAleenan  Read about Kevin McAleenan  the new acting homeland security secretary  Among the possible replacements for Ms  Nielsen in the long term is Ken Cuccinelli  the

said Ms  Nielsen had been pressured by Mr  Trump to be more aggressive in stemming the influx of migrant crossings at the border  people familiar with their discussions in recent months said Her entire time in the job was spent batting back suspicion from the president  even as he told people he liked how she performed on television and enjoyed dealing with her personally  He initially was

home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country  including doing things that were clearly illegal  such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum  She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws  court settlements and international obligations Those responses only infuriated Mr  Trump further  The president s fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as Ms  Nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained In a cabinet meeting surrounded by her peers  Mr  Trump castigated her repeatedly  leading her to draft a resignation letter and to tell colleagues that there was no reason for her to lead the department any longer  By the end of the week  she had reconsidered and remained in her position  becoming an increasingly fierce supporter of his policies  including the family separations Mr  Trump and Stephen Miller  the president s top immigration adviser  have privately but regularly complained about Ms  Nielsen  Lou Dobbs  a Fox News host who is one of the president s favorite sounding boards  has also encouraged Mr  Trump s negative views of her handling of the migrant crisis Ms  Nielsen lost a powerful protector when Mr  Kelly  her mentor  left his job as White House chief of staff at the beginning of the year  Mr  Kelly was the Trump administration s first homeland security secretary and lobbied for Ms  Nielsen to replace him Multiple White House officials said she had grown deeply paranoid in recent months  after numerous stories about her job being on the line  She also had supported the Immigration and Customs Enforcement nominee Mr  Trump withdrew  Ronald D  Vitiello  and her support for him was described as problematic for her with the president  Mr  Trump felt Mr  Vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president threatened again to do in a tweet on Sunday night The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other In early 2019  as the number of migrant families from Central American countries surged  the president s fury at Ms  Nielsen did  too  He repeatedly demanded that she cut off foreign aid to Central American countries even though the funding was the responsibility of the State Department  She repeatedly deflected his demands One day after Ms  Nielsen traveled to Honduras to sign a regional compact with officials from Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  Mr  Trump cut State Department funding for the countries  And in recent days  the president made public moves to undercut her authority  leaking news that he might nominate an  immigration czar  to assume oversight of the issue at the heart of Ms  Nielsen s department Still  Ms  Nielsen embraced the president s  crisis  language as apprehensions of migrants at the border shot up to thousands per day  On Friday  Mr  Trump traveled with Ms  Nielsen and Mr  McAleenan to Calexico  Calif   to highlight the issue While the number of border crossings is not as high as in the early 2000s  the demographic of migrants has shifted largely from individual Mexicans looking for jobs   who could easily be deported   to Central American families  overwhelming detention facilities and prompting mass releases of migrants into cities along the border Ms  Nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100 000 migrants in March But despite the trip and several stories about how much better her relationship with Mr  Trump was  Ms  Nielsen never learned how to manage him  people familiar with their discussions said  He often felt lectured to by Ms  Nielsen  the people familiar with the discussions said ImageMs  Nielsen lost a powerful protector when John F  Kelly  her mentor and the Trump

not an admirer of Ms  Nielsen  several administration officials said  That came to a head recently as Mr  Kushner had inserted himself into immigration discussions While Mr  Trump often blamed Ms  Nielsen for the surge in migrant crossings  she will be remembered for leading the department during the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy along the southwestern border  which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families An intense backlash ensued  and the Department of Homeland Security was unprepared to deal with separating nearly 3 000 children from their parents  Hampered by misstep after misstep  Kirstjen Nielsen s tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start   said Representative Bennie Thompson  a Mississippi Democrat and the chairman of the House s committee on Homeland Security   It is clearer now than ever that the Trump administration s border security and immigration policies   that she enacted and helped craft   have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border  Mr  Trump eventually moved to halt the family separations  though the government struggled in some cases to reunite those it had already separated By naming Mr  McAleenan acting secretary  Mr  Trump is installing another veteran of previous administrations  not a loyal foot soldier of Mr  Trump s campaign Married to a Salvadoran immigrant  Mr  McAleenan is a lawyer who wrote an honors thesis at Amherst College on marriage equality and applied at the F B I  after the Sept  11 attacks Described by colleagues as a savvy political operator  Mr  McAleenan worked cooperatively with Obama administration officials but later embraced Mr  Trump s agenda  which included unshackling Border Patrol agents from restrictions that the previous administration had imposed Mr  McAleenan was also one of three Department of Homeland Security officials who had urged Ms  Nielsen to sign the memo authorizing the routine separation of migrant families at the border The department  which has a budget of more than  40 billion and more than 240 000 employees  is an amalgam of 22 government agencies that was created after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  It is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters At 46  Ms  Nielsen was the youngest person to lead the sprawling department  and an unlikely choice for the job In the months immediately after the Sept  11 attacks  she helped set up the Transportation Security Administration  now an agency within the department  She also worked as a special assistant to President George W  Bush on natural disaster response while serving on the White House Homeland Security Council When Mr  Trump moved Mr  Kelly to the White House in July 2017  Ms  Nielsen moved with him  As the principal deputy chief of staff  she enforced Mr  Kelly s attempts to regulate access to Mr  Trump in the Oval Office  including the president s schedule   irritating White House staff members  who complained she was uncompromising Mr  Kelly later backed Ms  Nielsen to succeed him at the Homeland Security Department  though she was criticized as too inexperienced for the job by Democrats and anti immigration groups  Mr  Trump  however  said she was  ready on Day 1   There will be no on the job training for Kirstjen   Mr  Trump said in October 2017  announcing her nomination for the post But by the following spring  Ms  Nielsen was telling associates she was miserable in the job  

PARIS   The United States has revoked the visa of the International Criminal Court s chief prosecutor because of her attempts to investigate allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan  including any that may have been committed by American forces The visa revocation   confirmed on Friday by the office of the chief prosecutor  Fatou Bensouda  and the State Department in Washington   was assailed by rights advocates as unprecedented interference by the United States into the workings of the court  established nearly two decades ago to prosecute war crimes  genocide and crimes against humanity Ms  Bensouda  a Gambian lawyer for the court  which is based in The Hague  formally requested an investigation more than a year ago into war crimes in Afghanistan  The inquiry would mostly focus on large scale crimes against civilians attributed to the Taliban and Afghan government forces But it would also examine alleged C I A  and American military abuse in detention centers in Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004  and at sites in Poland  Lithuania and Romania  putting the court directly at odds with the United States An I C C  panel of judges has yet to authorize whether the prosecutor can open the criminal investigation The revocation of Ms  Bensouda s visa came less than a month after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo vowed to revoke visas for those connected with court investigations involving American citizens The United States is not a member state of the I C C  and does not recognize the court s authority to prosecute Americans In the past  though  the United States has cooperated with the court on other investigations  and Washington played a central role in establishing international criminal law at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders and in the creation of modern tribunals  The U S A  government should actively invite the prosecutor to come and meet  not ban her from traveling   Amnesty International s Center for International Justice said on Twitter   Cooperation with the I C C  is in the U S A  s interests   to share relevant information and show there is nothing to hide  Mr  Pompeo  in a March news briefing in Washington  said investigators  should not assume that you will still have or will get a visa  or that you will be permitted to enter the United States  if they are part of a I C C  investigation  He also said the United States was prepared to take further action  These visa restrictions will not be the end of our efforts   Mr  Pompeo said at the time   We are prepared to take additional steps  including economic sanctions if the I C C  does not change its course  At the time of Mr  Pompeo s announcement  Human Rights Watch called the announcement of visa bans an effort to  bully the court and deter scrutiny of U S  conduct  Mr  Pompeo s remarks also drew condemnation from I C C  member states  with a group of 22 foreign ministers expressing their concerns over the move last month The decision to revoke Ms  Bensouda s visa is not expected to affect her access to the United Nations headquarters in New York  which is protected by an agreement between the United States and the global body She periodically travels to the United Nations to brief the Security Council on investigations into crimes in Libya and the Darfur region of Sudan  which were referred to the court by the council It will also not affect her ability to carry out her duties at the I C C  or to move forward with a potential investigation  Ms  Bensouda has said Asked on Friday about the visa decision by the Americans  a United Nations spokesman  Stphane Dujarric  reiterated its diplomatic agreement with the United States  We very much trust the United States government will continue to comply with its obligations under the agreement   Mr  Dujarric said   Our assumption is that the prosecutor  when she needs to come to the United Nations  will be afforded a visa for work done at the United Nations  Ms  Bensouda is the only known court official targeted by Washington so far  but the issue raises the question of whether  if the Afghanistan investigation moves ahead  other officials would be barred from the United States Last week  the president of the court  Judge Chile Eboe Osuji  was able to deliver a speech in Washington without any issues  But the United States has made it clear that it would not cooperate in any potential Afghanistan investigation The United States is not the first country to have barred senior court officials  A former I C C  prosecutor and staff members were effectively denied entry to Sudan by its ruler  Omar Hassan al Bashir  indicted on charges of genocide and other crimes  and Ms  Bensouda and her team were denied entry to Burundi to investigate charges against its president In recent years the I C C  has disappointed some of its backers  who have observed its slow pace  inefficiencies and internal squabbles   and how many member governments only offer it halfhearted support  and fail to carry out court ordered arrest warrants  Some of those supporters saw the Trump administration s action as another blow to the body  albeit a double edged one  This move hurts the U S  s reputation far more than it hinders the I C C  prosecutor   said Stephen Rapp  a former American ambassador for war crimes issues who also served as an international prosecutor  In the past we have always been on the side of prosecutorial and judicial independence  and against authoritarian regimes that demand that justice bend to political power   he said  By revoking the visa  he said   we act like we have something to hide and in the process put ourselves on the same side as the world s thugs and dictators   

WASHINGTON   In recent months  Kirstjen Nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  had become a regular presence eating dinner at the Trump International Hotel  She had been heckled and booed when dining out after becoming the face of some of President Trump s most hard line immigration policies  like family separations  and her affinity for the hotel  a gathering place for the president s supporters  seemed like a sign that she felt safer on the inside But her status inside the White House  where she was subject to dressing downs from Mr  Trump during cabinet meetings and constant criticism by the president  was not much more secure So when Ms  Nielsen went to the White House on Sunday night to meet with the president to discuss some grievances  she was also prepared to avoid a messy end by letting Mr  Trump  who is known for not personally firing people  off the hook  After Mr  Trump made it clear that he was looking for a change  Ms  Nielsen told him she would resign  ridding him of a cabinet secretary who had long disappointed him Ms  Nielsen s departure  announced Sunday night  was abrupt but hardly unforeseen  the latest in a long and growing conga line of senior officials who have left the administration unceremoniously because of their own frustrations with the president  or because of the president s obvious disappointment in them  Usually  it is both Mr  Trump has ripped into Ms  Nielsen  holding her personally responsible for the uptick in crossings at the southwestern border  And Ms  Nielsen wanted to tell Mr  Trump that she was upset not to have been notified beforehand about his sudden withdrawal of Ron Vitiello  the nominee to serve as Immigration and Customs Enforcement director  and that she was frustrated at being pulled from security meetings in Europe last week and ordered to appear by the president s side on a trip to the border  according to someone close to Ms  Nielsen The end for Ms  Nielsen was something that has become familiar in the Trump administration  a high ranking official like Jeff Sessions  the former attorney general  or Rex Tillerson  the former secretary of state  leaving with a reputation in need of rehabilitation  Normally  people just resign   said Ronald A  Klain  who served as chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   The president sends word through an intermediary that he s unhappy  and you resign  The president says something nice about them and then they leave  But here  quitting isn t good enough  Some exits have been more humiliating than others  Since the departure of Mr  Tillerson  Mr  Trump has referred to him as  dumb as a rock  and  lazy as hell   After calling the departure of his defense secretary  Jim Mattis  a  retirement  and praising his service  Mr  Trump turned on him once he understood that the resignation was an affront to him   What s he done for me   Mr  Trump said of Mr  Mattis   How had he done in Afghanistan  Not too good  After years of haranguing Mr  Sessions in public and in private  Mr  Trump sent John F  Kelly  his former chief of staff  to demand his resignation in November  and he has not let up on him since he left office  In a speech in front of the Conservative Political Action Conference last month  Mr  Trump mimicked Mr  Sessions s southern accent while discussing his decision to recuse himself from the special counsel s investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 campaign ImageRex Tillerson  left  the former secretary of state  and Jeff Sessions  the former attorney general  were both forced out of their positions in the Trump administration CreditStephen Crowley The New York TimesMr  Kelly later suffered his own ignoble end  After he and Mr  Trump ironed out a departure plan at the end of last year  Mr  Kelly planned to make his own announcement at a senior staff dinner at the White House  But the president chose to break the news first  telling reporters that Mr  Kelly would be departing at the end of December Although all involved tried to put the best face on the Sunday meeting between Mr  Trump and Ms  Nielsen   someone familiar with it said the president had even asked her if she would want to return in another position   the two competed afterward for how to spin its contents Within minutes of the meeting s end  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter that Ms  Nielsen was  leaving her position   making it sound as if she was the latest cabinet secretary he had ousted online  Ms  Nielsen then posted her resignation letter on Twitter  notably leaving out any mention or praise for Mr  Trump Mr  Trump has yet to criticize her publicly since  But Ms  Nielsen has already absorbed more than her share of criticism for her role in implementing the president s policies Immigration and civil rights groups have been pressuring Fortune 500 companies to blacklist former Trump officials like Ms  Nielsen  who have promoted his immigration policies  writing that they  should not be allowed to seek refuge in your boardrooms or corner offices   Many other former administration officials have not experienced the post White House career bump that has become part of the payoff for putting in grueling hours on government salaries With a few exceptions  like the smooth send off for Nikki R  Haley  the former ambassador to the United Nations  and a glowing farewell to Linda McMahon  the former administrator of the Small Business Administration  Mr  Trump s top aides often find themselves damaged by their former boss in real time  or on delay Even those who have managed to stay in Mr  Trump s favor  like Mike Pompeo  the secretary of state  have a sense of gallows humor about what might ultimately befall them  I ll be there until he tweets me out of the office   Mr  Pompeo recently joked at an event in his home state of Kansas  when asked about his future in politics For her part  Ms  Nielsen appears to be intent on trying to minimize the damage to her reputation  with surrogates out defending her record  The so called immigration hard liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration  giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems   said Thad Bingel  who was a senior homeland security official in the Bush administration and served as an aide to Ms  Nielsen during her Senate confirmation  They apparently don t want anyone like a Secretary Nielsen or Secretary Kelly  who deals in reality  to tell them or the president any of this   

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Friday that he withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a  tougher  direction  a surprise decision before the president s trip to the southwestern border Ronald D  Vitiello  who was nominated last summer by Mr  Trump to run ICE  the agency that arrests  detains and deports people who are in the United States illegally  has been serving as the agency s acting director since last June  He had planned to accompany the president on his trip to California  but was left behind  Ron s a good man  but we re going in a tougher direction   Mr  Trump said to reporters as he left the White House en route to Calexico  Calif Mr  Vitiello s nomination had been awaiting approval by a second Senate committee and confirmation by the full chamber  In an email to ICE employees on Friday afternoon  he signaled that he planned to remain at the immigration agency  No replacement has yet been named  While I will not become the permanent director of ICE  I look forward to working alongside you in serving the American public with integrity  courage and excellence   Mr  Vitiello said in the email  which was read to The New York Times by an ICE employee on the condition of anonymity One person familiar with the president s thinking said that Mr  Trump believed that Mr  Vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president had proposed before backing off that threat this week Another person said that Stephen Miller  the president s chief policy adviser and a supporter of curtailing legal and illegal immigration  did not support Mr  Vitiello s nomination  The two people familiar with the president s thinking both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the internal White House decisions The president s abrupt decision came at a time when his administration considers the United States border with Mexico to be in crisis because of the flow of people trying to get into the country  making it a priority to have a confirmed appointee leading the agency to carry out the administration s policies  But some senators  including Republicans  had concerns that Mr  Vitiello was not the right person for this job Mr  Trump  who has continued to push for stronger deportation rules  had also expressed concern about whether a career civil servant  like Mr  Vitiello  would be up to the task  ICE has been led by acting directors since January 2017 Mr  Vitiello had recently been more outspoken about overflowing immigration facilities and strapped resources at the border  But that did little to assuage the National ICE Council  a union representing agency employees  which in February told the Senate it opposed Mr  Vitiello s nomination over what was described as his controversial posts on social media and his treatment of some ICE agents The request to withdraw Mr  Vitiello s nomination surprised officials on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  Even some Department of Homeland Security officials questioned whether it was sent in error  

WASHINGTON   They huddle together on the House floor  conferring over what to do on a tough vote  They exchange group texts to consult on legislation and plan for the  increasingly rare  after work drink  often with Bitmojis that capture their mood that day  They are frequently spotted walking together on Capitol Hill  huddled in what seems like an endless inside joke Among the 67 new Democrats in Congress  10 served in the military or intelligence agencies  which has shaped a tight and quite visible bond  All defeated Republicans in arduous races last year  many in the 31 districts carried by President Trump in the 2016 presidential election Their backgrounds in the military  where nonpartisanship is key  have also made them among the most moderate members of a caucus in which there is increasing pressure to slide firmly to the left on various policy issues  I don t know how I would be here without them   said Representative Chrissy Houlahan  Democrat of Pennsylvania and a former Air Force officer   Each of us has broken with the party for different reasons   she said  adding   It s nice to have a smaller group to talk to about what this all means  Often  they are among a handful of Democrats to vote with Republicans on politically charged  gotcha  measures that the majority had routinely rejected out of hand  in one crucial case helping pass a gun bill targeting undocumented immigrants Knowing that they were critical to delivering the House back to their party  the veterans seem unbowed  for now  to pressures from some Democrats to adhere to party lines  Many of them did not back Nancy Pelosi for House speaker  and she has repeatedly begged Democrats not to vote with Republicans on what she views as essentially nuisance measures  The speaker s office is inordinately powerful  and we have to work really hard to make this body egalitarian   said Representative Max Rose  Democrat of New York  who was a platoon leader in Afghanistan   The freshmen want to reduce seniority power  and the vets are leading that effort  Most had never run for office before  but said they were inspired by a sense of chaos in government and an erosion of faith in public institutions  While their transitions have been at times tense   the military notion of mission over ego as well as a preference for punctual meetings and clear lines of authority do not always translate well on Capitol Hill   these lawmakers are a cornerstone of the Democratic Party s strategy to maintain the House in 2020 ImageAmong the 67 new Democrats in Congress  10 served in the military or intelligence agencies CreditSarah Silbiger The New York Times There s no question those veterans and service members were central to our work to build a Democratic majority   said Cole Leiter  a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee   and their relentless focus on service has better prepared this Democratic caucus to work for their constituents  These members spent quite a bit of time getting to know one another during the campaign  largely through the Serve America PAC started by Representative Seth Moulton  Democrat of Massachusetts  who was among the first troops in Baghdad in 2003  When I ran in 2014 against a nine term incumbent  there was no member of Congress who would even speak with me   Mr  Moulton said   So I wanted to create that team for the amazing candidates who were running this time  What was important was building these relationships  They could call or text me at all hours of the night if they needed advice or something  We set up a Slack channel so that we could communicate more as a group  Once in Washington  the group immediately gravitated toward one another on bills and other legislative matters   It s the trust factor   said Elissa Slotkin  Democrat of Michigan and a former C I A  analyst who served three tours in Iraq   If Max Rose or Elaine Luria comes to me and says   I m doing this bill  Do you want to do it   they aren t going to twist the issue and play it for their own advantages   she said  referring to freshman veterans   We made the choice to focus on Congress and made Congress like a mission  During the government shutdown  Ms  Slotkin and Ms  Houlahan wrote a measure to protect federal workers in subsequent impasses  Representative Mikie Sherrill  Democrat of New Jersey and a former Navy helicopter pilot  seized on news coverage about problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs serving women and quickly got several veterans to sign on to a letter demanding the department secretary  Robert L  Wilkie  fix the system  The group has helped revive discussions about asserting the role of Congress in war authorization Veterans are also prone to seeking one another out across the aisle  Mr  Moulton  who served in the Marines  and Representative Brian Mast  a veteran and Republican from Florida  worked to bring together both parties on a conservation bill that pleased environmentalists and commercial fishermen alike They can often be seen sliding across the aisle to sit with Republican veterans on the House floor  like Representatives Jim Baird of Indiana and Will Hurd of Texas   We have a bias toward action because we all served in the trenches in an organization that is apolitical   Mr  Hurd said   We knew each other s ethos  The women  who have called themselves  the badass women   exchange group text messages and make special efforts to get together for dinner and talk during the week  Representative Abigail Spanberger  Democrat of Virginia and a former C I A  operations officer  had recently finished a tough town hall style meeting   among the more taxing  if vital  undertakings of lawmakers   and turned to the group for a lift   She was having a down moment   Ms  Slotkin said   So there was a text chain  and we all told her   You re awesome    and other messages of buoyancy  she said Ms  Spanberger said they also tried to keep a light tone on their group texts  endlessly razzing   about Ms  Sherrill s eternal obsession with the Gateway tunnel project in her home state  Mr  Rose s incandescent speeches on the floor  the way their hair looked in a photograph accompanying this article  They share funny travel anecdotes from the road and videos of their children singing   We had all come from places with really stressful environments   Ms  Spanberger said   so as stressful as the campaigns were  we had a perspective  In the difficult transition to Washington  they are often one another s lifeboat   It s just implicit that you have each other s back   said Representative Jason Crow  Democrat of Colorado who served as an Army captain   That s rare in this town   

BRUSSELS   With less than 48 hours before Britain s scheduled departure  the European Union extended the exit deadline early Thursday until the end of October  avoiding a devastating cliff edge divorce but settling none of the issues that have plunged British politics into chaos  dysfunction and recrimination On another difficult night for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain  European leaders scrapped her proposal for a postponement until June 30  concluding that such a short deadline was unrealistic for the departure known as Brexit  They agreed  however  to review the arrangement at the end of June to prevent British disruption to the bloc while the nation remains in Europe s departure lounge Although the intense pressure of recent weeks may abate for now  the path ahead still resembles a minefield  dotted with explosive issues like a possible attempt to topple Mrs  May  a general election or a second Brexit referendum   or some combination of the three  Most immediately  Mrs  May is likely to face calls to step down  and potential successors are already trying to raise money and advertise their credentials At a news conference  Donald Tusk  the president of the European Council  said that the two sides had agreed to what he called  a flexible extension  until Oct  31  adding that this provided an  additional six months for the U K  to find the best possible solution   In essence  the bloc agreed to kick the Brexit can down the road for another six months Mr  Tusk said that the Oct  31 date was  a bit shorter than I expected   but said that the extension should be enough to complete Brexit if London showed  good will   He told the British   Please do not waste this time  ImageFrom left  European Council President Donald Tusk  Prime Minister Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg  Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at the start of a special summit meeting on Brexit at the European Council in Brussels on Wednesday CreditOlivier Hoslet EPA  via ShutterstockBut he did not rule out another extension  The June review  he said  was not for negotiation  but only to inform member states about the state of play in Britain European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker dismissed worries that Britain would interfere in the work of the bloc  saying that Britain s being  a difficult partner  was  nothing new  Mrs  May said she knew that there was  huge frustration  at home that she had needed to request the extension  She appealed to lawmakers to support a Brexit agreement  adding that  the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear  But she can expect fierce criticism later on Thursday from her own lawmakers  many of whom opposed delaying Brexit to June  let alone October  Reminded of statements that she would not contemplate remaining in the bloc beyond June  Mrs  May said that the agreement allowed Britain to leave by then if Parliament approved a deal The extension means that Britain will almost certainly have to hold elections for the European Parliament on May 23  something Mrs  May once argued would be absurd  almost three years after Britons voted for withdrawal  That prospect seems certain to anger hard line Brexit supporters ImageEuropean leaders stressed that Britain s Parliament would still have to pass the withdrawal agreement before there could be any discussions about the future relationship  even if the country left without an agreement first CreditDan Kitwood Getty ImagesPresident Emmanuel Macron of France called the October date  the best compromise  to maintain European unity  It s now  up to Britons to be clear with themselves and their people   he said  about whether they want to participate in the European Parliament elections next month even though they would have to abandon the legislature a few months later This was not the first time Mrs  May had requested a postponement  Originally  she had promised Britons that she would strike a deal by March 29  only to acknowledge last month that the goal was impossible  Having missed that deadline  Mrs  May was a supplicant to the 27 other leaders of the bloc  who made their latest decision after she had left the room Having lost control of the process in Brussels  Mrs  May will return to a pitched battle with pro Brexit Conservative lawmakers  including a significant number who now want her out and seem willing to risk an economically damaging departure without an agreement Some have been arguing that Britain should use an extension to sabotage European Union business from the inside  While Mrs  May has promised not to do so  her position is so shaky that thoughts are turning to how a successor might behave  particularly a pro Brexit hard liner like Boris Johnson  the former foreign secretary At the same time  if Britain s Parliament should finally pass the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the bloc  then Brexit would take place on the first of the next month ImageThe president of the European Council  Donald Tusk  center left  and the president of the European Commission  Jean Claude Juncker  have suggested a lengthy extension to the Brexit deadline CreditEmmanuel Dunand Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesEuropean nations had been divided between those who wanted a shorter extension  to keep up pressure on Britain to resolve Brexit  and those who wanted to give it the time and space to reach a sensible conclusion On Wednesday it was Mr  Macron who took the toughest line  arguing that Britain needed to propose a credible plan to resolve the crisis On his insistence  plans to give Britain as much as another year were scrapped in favor of a shorter delay  He had argued that a long extension risked disrupting the bloc s more important work and that Britain s political confusion could prove contagious But there was never any question of slamming the door instantly on Britain and triggering a disruptive  no deal  Brexit that would have occurred Friday night in the absence of an extension  And Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany stressed the need for Britain to have time to manage an orderly process  which would allow for a good relationship between the two sides after the divorce The October deadline was therefore a compromise  chosen in part because it would keep Britain outside the new European Commission  which will be formed in the fall ImageTrucks queued last month on the main road into the Port of Dover  southern England  because of a work slowdown by French customs officers  The bottleneck illustrated the possible effect of a no deal Brexit on traffic across the English Channel CreditGareth Fuller Press Association  via Associated PressSo far  the British Parliament has shown little indication that it will ever approve the withdrawal deal that Mrs  May negotiated with the European Union  That is a legally binding treaty that would resolve technical issues  like the government s outstanding financial commitments to the bloc  and keep Britain inside its economic structures until at least December 2020 After that point  Mrs  May wants to detach Britain from Europe s customs union and single market  and to take control of immigration from the Continent That formula has been rejected three times in Parliament and  despite attempts to broker an accord with the opposition Labour Party  prospects for its passage still look low More talks between the parties were scheduled for Thursday  but Labour has complained that Mrs  May has shown no sign of budging from her basic goal of taking Britain out of a customs union with the bloc Were she to accept staying in a customs union  which is Labour s bedrock position  that would preclude Britain from forging trade deals on its own  defeating  in the minds of pro Brexit lawmakers  the entire purpose of Brexit  Such a step would risk cabinet resignations and enrage the party faithful In the coming weeks there may be more votes in Parliament to gauge opinion on various approaches to Brexit  but the possibility of assembling a sustainable majority for any one blueprint still seems remote Conservative Brexit supporters are hoping they can replace Mrs  May with a hard liner who could reopen the withdrawal agreement painfully negotiated over months with the European Union But European officials emphasize that the withdrawal agreement  including a provision known as the Irish backstop  designed to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland  will not change  If Britain wants a managed Brexit  it must pass the withdrawal agreement first  they say  Only then can the European Union begin negotiations on a future relationship

In the opulent halls of the Emirates Palace hotel  a seat of power in Abu Dhabi where 114 domes decorate the vast rooftop  a delegation of about a dozen Chinese diplomats lobbied foreign ministers of the Muslim world last month China has been fighting criticism that it has detained as many as one million members of Muslim ethnic minorities in indoctrination camps in its western Xinjiang region  But at the two day conclave in early March  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation   a group of 57 nations that has been a vocal defender of the Rohingyas and Palestinians   handed Beijing a significant victory In a resolution on protecting the rights of Muslim minorities around the world  the group praised China for  providing care to its Muslim citizens  Its vast system of detention without trial has drawn condemnation from the State Department and Congress  but no sanctions  and only scattered criticism in Europe and at the United Nations  That is still more of a response than in the Muslim world  where nations   including Pakistan  Indonesia and other recipients of big Chinese loans   have overlooked China s abuses against ethnic Uighurs  Kazakhs and others And as Muslim countries fall in line  the West is under less pressure to take action The major deterrent to antagonizing Beijing is its blunt economic power In Washington  President Trump s trade talks hang in the balance  China is building ports  railways and roads in countries rich and poor across Asia  Europe and Africa in its global trillion dollar infrastructure push  the Belt and Road Initiative ImageA satellite image taken over Hotan  Xinjiang  in August showed an indoctrination camp  center  that had expanded CreditPlanet Labs Inc Some of the recipients are moderate Muslim countries  like Turkey  Pakistan  Indonesia and Malaysia  which human rights advocates had hoped would counter conservative Arab states  lack of concern for Muslim minorities Even New Zealand s Prime Minister  Jacinda Ardern  who forcefully condemned violence against Muslims after mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last month  focused on promoting trade with China during a visit to Beijing last week She raised the treatment of the Uighurs with China s top leaders only in private  and told reporters afterward   You can t do much more than that  Confident at Home and AbroadWhen the West imposed sanctions on China for the massacre of pro democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square on June 4  1989  policymakers gave little thought to retaliation  It was still a weak country then  without the economic leverage it now wields China is the European Union s biggest trading partner  and several newer members are grateful recipients of China s new infrastructure  No one wants to do this alone   said Mikko Huotari  deputy director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin   There s a general fear of deterioration of relations with China  In defending the detention camps to counterparts  Chinese diplomats have mounted some novel arguments  They have told American officials  for example  that Beijing is applying in Xinjiang best practices it gleaned from studying the United States ImageOne of the internment camps in Xinjiang that local officials have portrayed as vocational training centers CreditThomas Peter ReutersThe Chinese argue that the facilities in Xinjiang are no different from the American military prisons in Guantnamo Bay  Cuba  where foreign terrorism suspects have been held without trial The Americans have replied that the detainees in Guantnamo eventually had access to lawyers  fair trial and visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross  none of which have been available in Xinjiang  two American officials involved in the conversations said The government insists that the camps are vocational training centers that curb extremism  But witnesses and experts describe them as the heart of an immense campaign to transform Xinjiang s 11 million Uighurs and other minority Muslims into loyal servants of the Communist Party The campaign challenges traditional definitions of crimes against humanity  which complicates the world s response  said Adrian Zenz  a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany  What we are witnessing in Xinjiang is different  not quantitatively but qualitatively  a massive  concerted campaign of coerced sociocultural re engineering   he said   It is not so much a crime against physical bodies as it is against souls  There is also little dissent in China  The state s censored news outlets run propaganda videos that make the camps seem like quiet oases of work  with Uighur inmates sitting in rows at work tables Many Chinese support the government s policies in Xinjiang because of concerns about Uighur separatism  including violent attacks ImageA protest to denounce China s treatment of ethnic Uighurs in front of the Chinese consulate in Istanbul last year CreditOzan Kose Agence France Presse   Getty Images Most Chinese are very supportive of the iron fist policy   said Zhu Feng  a professor of international relations in Nanjing   The Chinese fear of deep Islamization and Islamic extremism is increasing  Beijing at first denied the camps  existence  But it has since switched tactics  playing on fears of Islamic extremism Last month  Chinese officials even wrote letters to their counterparts urging them to avoid an event held by the United States mission in Geneva to discuss Xinjiang  suggesting that participation could hurt ties with Beijing How China Won the Support of Islamic LeadersBefore the Abu Dhabi gathering in March  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation held a December session on human rights There  member countries expressed concern about China s mass internment of Muslims  a campaign that they described as  disturbing  and said needed monitoring Around the world  rights activists cheered  It was a rare bright spot for Uighur advocates Fatimah Abdulghafur  39  a Uighur doctoral candidate at the University of Wisconsin Madison  said that for the first time she had felt hopeful that her brother and father  whom she has been unable to contact for two years  would be released from the camps  Maybe hope is coming our way  maybe we can raise some global awareness among Muslims   she recalled thinking after the December event ImageUighur men praying in a mosque in Hotan in 2015 CreditGreg Baker Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBut China responded with a diplomatic campaign targeting the Muslim world In January  China escorted eight officials from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on a 10 day tour of Xinjiang that included visits to select facilities  said a human rights advocate who was briefed on the visit There were differences among the officials about what they saw at the camps  Still  they decided to close ranks because they did not want to upset China at the foreign ministers  gathering  the advocate said In the run up to the Abu Dhabi meeting  China cemented its ties with two Arab friends   Saudi Arabia and Kuwait   who have a history of remaining silent on the plight of non Arab Muslims It also made an example of a country that dared to criticize the camps In February  the spokesman for Turkey s foreign ministry  Hami Aksoy  called the  systematic assimilation  of the Uighurs a  great shame for humanity  and urged China to close the camps Beijing ignored the request and retaliated by closing a Chinese consulate in Turkey  The Chinese ambassador  Deng Li  warned that  criticizing your friend publicly everywhere  could hurt economic relations Turkey is the current chair of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  but when the country s delegate was given the floor in Abu Dhabi  he refrained from raising the issue of Xinjiang  the advocate who was briefed on discussions said The resolution passed by consensus  Uighurs like Ms  Abdulghafur were devastated  We don t feel that global brotherhood love from them   she said   They sell their soul  they sell their faith  for money  They know that millions of people are suffering   

President Trump has adopted a blunt new message in recent days for migrants seeking refuge in the United States   Our country is full  To the degree the president is addressing something broader than the recent strains on the asylum seeking process  the line suggests the nation can t accommodate higher immigration levels because it is already bursting at the seams  But it runs counter to the consensus among demographers and economists They see ample evidence of a country that is not remotely  full    but one where an aging population and declining birthrates among the native born population are creating underpopulated cities and towns  vacant housing and troubled public finances Local officials in many of those places view a shrinking population and work force as an existential problem with few obvious solutions  I believe our biggest threat is our declining labor force   said Gov  Phil Scott of Vermont  a Republican  in his annual budget address this year   It s the root of every problem we face  This makes it incredibly difficult for businesses to recruit new employees and expand  harder for communities to grow and leaves fewer of us to cover the cost of state government   Or if you look at a city like Detroit   many of the city s problems would become less difficult if its population would start growing   said Edward Glaeser  a Harvard economist   All sorts of things like the hangover pension liability become much more solvable if you re actually looking at new people coming in  ImageA road less traveled in Rutland  Vt   last spring  Vermont s governor has described the state s shrinking labor force as  at the root of every problem we face   CreditCaleb Kenna for The New York TimesThis consensus is visible in official government projections  The Congressional Budget Office foresees the American labor force rising by only 0 5 percent a year over the coming decade  about one third as fast as from 1950 to 2007  That is a crucial reason that economic growth is forecast to remain well below its late 20th century levels And that  in turn  is reflected in the national fiscal outlook  There are now 2 8 workers for every recipient of Social Security benefits  a rate on track to fall to 2 2 by 2035  according to the program s trustees  Many state pension plans face even greater demography induced strains In smaller cities and rural areas  demographic decline is a fundamental fact of life  A recent study by the Economic Innovation Group found that 80 percent of American counties  with a combined population of 149 million  saw a decline in their number of prime working age adults from 2007 to 2017 Population growth in the United States has now hit its lowest level since 1937  partly because of a record low fertility rate   the number of children born per woman  The United States increasingly has population growth rates similar to slow growing Japan and Western Europe  with immigration partly offsetting that shift  The Trump administration has portrayed the surge of asylum seekers at the southern border as a crisis  and applied aggressive tactics to deport undocumented immigrants already in the United States  But it has also announced plans to issue up to 30 000 additional H 2B visas for temporary workers  That immigrants keep showing up here is a testament to our freedom and the economic opportunity here   said Matthew Kahn  an economist at the University of Southern California  If immigrants weren t trying to come   if they believed the United States to be full   that would be a problem  Mr  Kahn said A particular fear  said John Lettieri  president of the Economic Innovation Group  is that declining population  falling home prices and weak public finances will create a vicious cycle that the places losing population could find hard to escape He proposes a program of  heartland visas   in which skilled immigrants could obtain work visas to the United States on the condition they live in one of the counties facing demographic decline   with troubled counties themselves deciding whether to participate Although some of the areas with declining demographics are hostile to immigration  others  cities as varied as Baltimore  Indianapolis and Fargo  N D   have embraced the strategy of encouraging it  One of the key solutions is to welcome immigrants into these communities   said Brooks Rainwater  director of the National League of Cities  Center for City Solutions Many parts of the country that are growing in population and that are more economically dynamic have depended on the arrival of immigrants for that success Sun Belt metros like Dallas and Phoenix have been built on the logic of rapid expansion   of quickly built homes  of poached employers  of new highways paved to ever newer subdivisions  Their economic development strategy is growth  Their chief input is people   the more  the better  Growth cities need immigrants to continue their growth   said Joel Kotkin  executive director of the Houston based Center for Opportunity Urbanism  which promotes policies to help cities grow   The older historically declining cities need immigrants to reinvigorate their economies  And the expensive cities need them because  frankly  white people  African Americans and middle class people are leaving for more affordable areas  As many industrial cities have lost population since the mid 20th century  Americans have built whole new metropolises on land that was virtually empty then  The Las Vegas metropolitan area  with more than two million people today  had barely 50 000 in 1950  Still  only about 3 percent of the country s land is urbanized America s metropolitan areas remain among the least dense in the world  said Sonia Hirt  a professor of landscape architecture and planning at the University of Georgia  Nationwide  the United States has less than one third of the population density of the European Union  and a quarter of the density of China  Factually speaking  the country is not actually full   that s impossible   Ms  Hirt said   The real question is  if you continue on the current path of immigration  does this bring more benefits than it brings costs  Economists  too  argue that countries  or even cities  can t really fill up  Rather  communities choose not to make the political choices necessary to accommodate more people  At the local level  that means neighbors may be unwilling to allow taller buildings or to invest in more schools or improved infrastructure  At the national level  it means that politicians may be unwilling to take up immigration reform  or to address workers who fear unemployment  The president s comments echo such local fights   We re full  has often been a motto for people to keep out poorer renters  minority households or apartment buildings  among both conservatives and liberals  The claim can be a way of disguising exclusion as practicality  It s not that we re unwelcoming  it s just that we re full When it comes to the economy  at least  the country looks more like one that is too empty than too full  RelatedTrump Signals Even Fiercer Immigration Agenda  With a Possible Return of Family

This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting  WASHINGTON   Seven years ago  when a former C I A  prisoner  Majid Khan  pleaded guilty at Guantnamo to being a courier for Al Qaeda  his lawyers were warned that any mention of the word  torture  would lead a court security officer to trigger a mute button so the public  listening on a 40 second delay  would not hear it This week the question of his treatment was front and center  this time in a pre sentencing hearing  Mr  Khan s lawyers asked a military judge on Monday to order prosecutors to produce evidence and witnesses about the secret prison network where the intelligence agency kept Mr  Khan incommunicado from March 2003 to September 2006  The material we seek  that is uniquely in the possession of the government  concerns Mr  Khan s torture   one of his lawyers  Katya Jestin  told the judge   The C I A  torture program in this case  your honor  appears to be the third rail  No security officer hit the mute button  A red light on the judge s bench used to signal a security breach never lit up Seventeen and a half years after the Sept  11  2001  terror attacks  and a decade after President Barack Obama ordered the C I A  to dismantle any remnants of its global prison network  the military commission system is still wrestling with how to handle evidence of what the United States did to the Qaeda suspects it held at C I A  black sites  While the topic of torture can now be discussed in open court  there is still a dispute about how evidence of it can be gathered and used in the proceedings at Guantnamo Bay  Cuba By law  prosecutors cannot use evidence gained through torture   or any other involuntary statements   at the war court  where eight of Guantnamo s 40 prisoners are accused of being complicit in terrorist attacks  Prosecutors have made clear that nothing the defendants said at the black sites will be used as evidence But defense lawyers have continued to press for details of what happened to their clients and to be able to use the information either to fight the charges or to win more lenient sentencing  And they have been aided by changing circumstances  not least the government s declassification of some details of how the prisoners were interrogated by the C I A The issue has been most intensely debated in Guantnamo s two death penalty cases  the 9 11 terror attacks that killed 2 976 people and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 in which 17 American sailors died Defense lawyers in those cases have sought for years to get access to eyewitnesses and graphic details from the C I A  sites  The lawyers want to use descriptions of torture to ask the judge to exclude some of the defendants  own statements after they left the black sites  The defense lawyers also have said they would cite torture to seek dismissal of the charges on grounds of outrageous government conduct  an extraordinary legal defense that is used in civilian courts but is seldom granted If the men are convicted  the lawyers want the details of how the defendants were treated to argue that the United States has lost the moral authority to execute men it has tortured ImageThe lawyers for Majid Khan  a prisoner at Guantnamo  say he was tortured in a C I A  black site CreditCenter for Constitutional RightsThe fight over access to evidence and witnesses from the black sites is one of the factors that has slowed progress in the cases  In the process  it has illustrated how fundamental legal issues about the rights of Guantnamo defendants remain unresolved   and how the passage of time is altering how some of them are handled The conflict is not limited to the death penalty cases  as Mr  Khan s proceedings show The topic of his torture was strictly taboo on Feb  29  2012  when he made his first court appearance since disappearing from his native Pakistan in 2003 at age 23  At that first hearing  Mr  Khan  who lived in suburban Baltimore for seven years and graduated from high school there in 1999  admitted to volunteering to work for Al Qaeda after Sept  11 and plotting with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  the accused architect of the attacks But in the intervening years  the Obama administration declassified details of what Mr  Khan said the C I A  did to him  By his account  he was beaten  hung naked from a wooden beam for three days with no food  kept for months in darkness  and submerged  shackled and hooded  into a tub of ice and water Additional details of his treatment were revealed in the partly declassified introduction to a Senate study of the George W  Bush administration s black site program  In his second year of C I A  detention  according to a cable cited in the study  the agency  infused  a pure of pasta  sauce  nuts  raisins and hummus up Mr  Khan s rectum  because he went on a hunger strike The C I A  calls this  rectal feeding   Defense lawyers call it rape Mr  Khan s lawyers now want to call witnesses and gather evidence to show his sentencing jury what happened to him The litigation over black site evidence has gone on for years  to the dismay of some family members who lost loved ones to Al Qaeda terrorists  particularly families of those killed on Sept  11  2001  when hijackers crashed four passenger planes into the World Trade Center  the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field  What our family members endured during the attacks on the airplanes and in the building was beyond torture   said Terry Strada  whose husband Thomas was killed in the World Trade Center She has campaigned for more transparency about what happened on Sept  11  But she sees the focus in the Guantnamo hearings on what happened to the defendants in the black sites as  stalling and stonewalling the process  In Mr  Khan s case  he has pleaded guilty to delivering  50 000 of Qaeda money to a Southeast Asian affiliate that was used to finance the bombing of a Marriott hotel in Jakarta  Indonesia  in 2003 that killed 11 people  He also admitted to agreeing to assassinate Pervez Musharraf  then the president of Pakistan  a plot that was never pulled off Under a plea agreement  he became what his military attorney  Lt  Cmdr  Jared Hernandez of the Navy  called  Guantnamo s sole high value cooperator  and can be sentenced to 25 years of confinement  He is being credited with time served since his plea deal  meaning he could get out in 2037 His lawyers say testimony about his years in C I A  custody could strengthen a post sentencing clemency petition  They also may ask the judge to grant him credit for those years in the C I A  prisons as pretrial punishment and reduce his sentence ImageAmerican troops standing guard outside Camp Delta at Guantnamo Bay Detention Center  By law  prosecutors cannot use involuntary statements at the war court  where eight of Guantnamo s 40 prisoners are accused of being complicit in terrorist attacks CreditRamon Espinosa Associated PressIn the military tribunal system  prosecutors are the gatekeepers of classified trial evidence  They have forbidden defense team members from independently contacting or investigating most former black site workers  The C I A  is shielding their identities as well as the nations that hosted the black sites  invoking national security  though most if not all the nations have already been identified publicly  The C I A  is not on trial   Jeffrey Groharing  a case prosecutor  told the judge at a hearing at Guantnamo on Nov  15  That same day  in a bid to persuade the judge that the prosecution had met its responsibility to provide information to the defense  Mr  Groharing stood at the war court and read aloud from documents the defense lawyers can use from a C I A  inspector general s investigation One described how  during an interrogation  Mr  Mohammed refused an interrogator s order to drink water  According to the document read by Mr  Groharing  Mr  Mohammed  was taken back to the bathing room  placed on a plastic sheet and a medical officer rehydrated Mohammed rectally  Mohammed clearly hated the procedure  When he was returned to the interrogation room  he then complied and drank water  In another document Mr  Groharing read  an unnamed senior interrogator described an unidentified black site as  good for interrogations  because it was  the closest thing he has seen to a dungeon  facilitating the displacement of detainee explanations  Spectators heard the audio on a 40 second delay from the gallery at the back of court  separated by triple pane glass   It s hard to imagine a more rich and vivid description than those statements   Mr  Groharing said Defense lawyers called the written accounts sanitized versions of the eyewitness testimony they sought Mr  Mohammed s lawyer  David Nevin  said the term rectal rehydration  is a polite way of saying rape with the insertion of a foreign object into the rectum  But how is it done  I d like to know  how is it done  One small detail can change a juror s mind about whether to vote for capital punishment  Mr  Nevin has said Eugene R  Fidell  who teaches military law at Yale Law School  said a showdown over black site evidence was foreseeable  The defense lawyers have to have the tools with which to perform their duty  especially in capital cases  No question   Mr  Fidell said   Somebody should have thought about that before they started torturing these people  He added   This was an accident waiting to happen  The only thing that surprises me is this is 2019 and the problem remains unresolved   

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William P  Barr said on Wednesday that he would scrutinize the F B I  s investigation of the Trump campaign s ties to Russia  including whether  spying  conducted by American intelligence agencies on the campaign s associates had been properly carried out  I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal   Mr  Barr said during testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee  adding that he wanted to look into both  the genesis and the conduct  of the F B I  inquiry  He cast his interest as a matter of protecting civil liberties from potential abuse by the government  I think spying did occur   Mr  Barr said   The question is whether it was adequately predicated  And I m not suggesting that it wasn t adequately predicated  But I need to explore that  The remarks by the new attorney general   particularly his embrace of the term spying  which is frequently invoked by critics of the Russia investigation   are certain to please President Trump and his allies  who have accused American law enforcement officials of targeting his campaign out of political malice Mr  Barr s pledge  made as he prepares to make public in coming days a redacted version of the special counsel s report on the Russia inquiry  was a sign that after nearly three years of investigating the president s campaign and Russia  the Justice Department s focus may begin to shift in a direction that Mr  Trump has demanded In addition to Mr  Barr s review of the F B I  investigation  the Justice Department s inspector general  a specially tasked United States attorney and Republicans in Congress are all studying key actions taken during the course of the inquiry  Those actions include how officials opened the Trump Russia investigation  called Crossfire Hurricane  and obtained a secret warrant to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser Mr  Trump s thirst for a reckoning among his inquisitors appears to have only grown in recent weeks  Minutes before Mr  Barr took the witness stand on Wednesday  the president called the investigation an  attempted coup  and claimed  again  that he had been  totally exonerated  by the report  despite the fact that Robert S  Mueller III  the special counsel who took over the F B I  s Russia investigation in 2017  explicitly said he could not clear the president of trying to obstruct justice  It was an illegal investigation   Mr  Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Texas  In some of his harshest criticism of the investigation to date  Mr  Trump said   Everything about it was crooked   every single thing about it  There were dirty cops  These were bad people   This was an attempted takedown of a president   he added   And we beat them  We beat them  Mr  Mueller delivered his nearly 400 pages of findings to Mr  Barr late last month  Much of Wednesday s hearing  and an earlier session with House lawmakers on Tuesday  was focused on that report  on continuing redactions of delicate information before it becomes public  and on Mr  Barr s characterization of what Mr  Mueller found Mr  Barr  who said that he hoped to make a redacted version of Mr  Mueller s report public next week  used more measured tones in describing the review he intended to oversee than Mr  Trump did  The attorney general also signaled that he would wait to hear from others already at work  including the inspector general who could deliver a report in May or June  before replicating their review ImageRobert S  Mueller III  the special counsel who took over the F B I  s Russia investigation in 2017  delivered his nearly 400 pages of findings to Mr  Barr late last month CreditCliff Owen Associated PressHe said he was not starting an investigation into the F B I  or any other law enforcement agency  per se  but he did allude to several of the bureau s former leaders who oversaw the opening of the Russia inquiry  To the extent there were any issues at the F B I   I do not view it as a problem that is endemic to the F B I    Mr  Barr said   I think there was probably failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon  Mr  Barr did not present evidence to back up his statement  and he declined to share details about which investigative actions concerned him The F B I  obtained a secret surveillance warrant to spy on one former Trump aide  Carter Page  after he left the campaign  Republicans in Congress have questioned the legality of that warrant because it used unverified Democrat funded opposition research compiled into a dossier by Christopher Steele  a former British intelligence officer  But a judge approved it  and it was not clear whether any laws were broken Both Dana Boente  now the F B I  general counsel  and Rod J  Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general  signed the FISA renewal application on Mr  Page The bureau sought the wiretap on Mr  Page because of his previous contacts with a Russian intelligence officer in 2013 and material in the dossier  Among claims that Mr  Steele compiled from sources was that during a visit to Moscow in July 2016  Mr  Page secretly met a Russian official promising compromising information about Hillary Clinton   an accusation that Mr  Page has denied The F B I  also used a confidential informant to collect information on Trump campaign associates  which prompted more accusations of spying by the president Mr  Trump or people close to him have leveled charges that have not borne out  including that President Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower in Manhattan Defenders of the F B I  have objected to the notion that it spied on the Trump campaign  The F B I  and Justice Department  they say  waited to seek a court order permitting it to wiretap Mr  Page until after he left the campaign and was on the verge of returning to Russia Still  the wiretap order enabled F B I  agents to obtain and read older emails in Mr  Page s account  including when he was working with the campaign  The inspector general  Michael E  Horowitz  has asked those involved in that effort why they did not use a so called filter team to review the messages and screen out any sensitive but irrelevant information before adding them to the Russia investigation case file  However  there appeared to be no rule requiring such a step  according to a person familiar with the inquiry The inspector general has also asked about the handling of F B I  informants  including Mr  Steele and Stefan A  Halper  an American academic who teaches in Britain ImagePresident Trump spoke Wednesday before leaving for Texas  He called the Russia investigation  illegal  and said that  everything about it was crooked  CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesAfter the F B I  opened the Russia investigation in late July 2016  agents asked Mr  Halper to gather information on Mr  Page and George Papadopoulos  another former Trump campaign adviser Mr  Halper had also spoken to Mr  Page at a symposium that month  which has raised suspicions by critics of the F B I  that the investigation started earlier than the bureau has said  But that earlier encounter was a coincidence  according to a former federal law enforcement official Mr  Barr appeared to be responding generally to those episodes  many of which have been the subject of news reports  I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused   he said   I think that is one of the principal roles of the attorney general  Democrats involved in Congress s investigations of Russia s election interference quickly chastised Mr  Barr for using the term spying in a way that they believe feeds a right wing conspiracy of F B I  wrongdoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said it appeared he was  going off the rails  to protect Mr  Trump Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee  accused Mr  Barr of giving  a wink and a nod  to a  long debunked  spying  conspiracy  And at one point  Senator Jack Reed  Democrat of Rhode Island  pressed Mr  Barr on whether he had  specific evidence of anything improper in the counterintelligence investigation   Mr  Barr said he did not  I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now   he said   I do have questions about it  But when Senator Brian Schatz  Democrat of Hawaii  asked Mr  Barr if he had intended to use the term spying   a term the senator said might  cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out    Mr  Barr rephrased his statement  I m not sure of all of the connotations of that word that you re referring to   the attorney general said  then he added   I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance  Mr  Barr  who began his career at the C I A   did not intend to imply that spying was inherently wrong  according to a person who has discussed the matter with him but was not authorized to share their conversation  Mr  Barr sees no technical difference between that term and surveillance  He indicated that at issue was not the act of surveilling but whether officials followed proper procedures when they decided to gather intelligence on Trump s associates in 2016 Senator Jeanne Shaheen  Democrat of New Hampshire  elicited a response from Mr  Barr that invoked another era  When she asked why Mr  Barr was going to review the origins of the Russia investigation  he answered that  the generation I grew up in  which is the Vietnam War period  you know  people were all concerned about spying on antiwar people and so forth by the government

LONDON   British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk on Friday asking to delay Brexit until June 30 The text of May s letter is below  Dear Donald In the European Council Decision of 22 March  taken in agreement with the United Kingdom  the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed that if the House of Commons had approved the Withdrawal Agreement by 29 March 2019  the period provided for by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union would be extended until 22 May 2019 to provide for ratification  The House of Commons declined to approve the Withdrawal Agreement and take up that option  Therefore unless we agree a further extension at the European Council you have convened for 10 April  the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal at 2300 BST on 12 April 2019  The Government s policy has always been and remains to leave the European Union in an orderly way  and without undue delay  The House of Commons has not thus far approved the deal that would enable this  nor   despite considerable efforts by both Members of Parliament and by the Government   has it yet found a majority in favor of any other proposal The House has  however  continued to express its opposition to leaving the European Union without a deal  The Government agrees that leaving with a deal is the best outcome This impasse cannot be allowed to continue  In the UK it is creating uncertainty and doing damage to faith in politics  while the European Union has a legitimate desire to move on to decisions about its own future  That is why the Government has decided to take further action to seek a consensus across the House of Commons on the right way forward  I therefore met the Leader of the Opposition earlier this week to discuss whether we might be able to agree a proposal that can be put before the House of Commons which allows the United Kingdom to leave the European Union with a deal  We agreed follow up discussions that are now taking place  I have also extended an open invitation to Members of Parliament more broadly to work with me to achieve a consensus that respects the result of the 2016 referendum  I am clear that all of these discussions need to be based on acceptance of the Withdrawal Agreement without reopening it  as the United Kingdom agreed with the European Council at our last meeting  and should focus on the framework for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union  If a consensus is going to be found  compromise will be needed on all sides  in the national interest  If the talks do not lead to a single unified approach soon  the Government would instead look to establish a consensus on a small number of clear options on the future relationship that could be put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue  The Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House  if the Opposition will commit to doing the same  These steps demonstrate that the Government is determined to bring this process to a resolution quickly  The Government acknowledges  however  that after approval to the Withdrawal Agreement is achieved  the process of enacting those commitments in domestic law and therefore ratifying the Agreement in the United Kingdom will take time  Therefore having reluctantly sought an extension to the Article 50 period last month  the Government must now do so again  It remains the Government s view that  despite this request to extend the Article 50 period  it is in the interests of neither the United Kingdom as a departing Member State  nor the European Union as a whole  that the United Kingdom holds elections to the European Parliament  However  the United Kingdom accepts the European Council s view that if the United Kingdom were still a Member State of the European Union on 23 May 2019  it would be under a legal obligation to hold the elections  The Government is therefore undertaking the lawful and responsible preparations for this contingency  including by making the Order that sets the date of the poll  The process I have laid out in paragraphs 4 and 5 is designed to bring the House Of Commons to rapid approval Of the Withdrawal Agreement and a shared vision for the future relationship  and to allow the Government to introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and so ratify the Agreement  An important part of that process will be the Government agreeing with the Opposition a program for the Bill  The Government s objective is to ensure that this program means the Bill can complete its passage such that the Agreement can be brought into force and the United Kingdom withdraw from the European Union in time to cancel the European Parliament elections  I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50 3  of the Treaty on European Union  including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty  The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019  If the parties are able to ratify before this date  the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early  The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections  but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible  It is frustrating that we have not yet brought this process to a successful and orderly conclusion  The United Kingdom Government remains strongly committed to doing so  and will continue to act as a constructive and responsible Member State of the European Union in accordance with the duty of sincere cooperation throughout this unique period  I would be grateful for the opportunity to update our colleagues on the position at our meeting on Wednesday     Reporting by Elizabeth Piper and Alistair Smout  Editing by Guy Faulconbridge  

From Day 1 in the Oval Office  President Trump has shown a unique obsession with the financial markets  tweeting that high stock prices proved he was making America great again  But a new chapter opened in October  when the markets dropped sharply  and Mr  Trump began making critical presidential decisions with an eye to pushing stock prices back up As soon as the markets turned downward  Mr  Trump softened his hard line on Chinese trade practices  trying to quiet market fears that his tariff threats against Beijing would start a global trade war  Then he started attacking the United States Federal Reserve  saying its interest rate policies were undermining stock prices  and followed with rants about firing the chairman of the Fed  Jerome Powell  And last week  Axios quoted a source who had spoken to Mr  Trump as saying that the president had delayed his threat to close the Mexico border out of concern over how the markets would react For Mr  Trump to base serious decisions about trade  monetary policy and immigration on market mood swings ensures that the zany uncertainty of his tenure will continue to reach new heights Mr  Trump s sudden moderation on China was particularly striking because  in an otherwise mercurial career  he had remained consistent on trade  Going back to the 1980s  Mr  Trump has been accusing Asian competitors in particular of using unfair trade deals to steal America s lunch Moreover  Mr  Trump has been drawing broad support for his hard line on trade with China  even among his critics in Congress and in Europe  Many of them agreed that China was using state power to dominate the global information technology industry  exclude American companies from its domestic market and steal intellectual property  They were openly rooting for Mr  Trump to win on this issue  and to cut a tough deal Yet when the markets fell on fear of a United States China trade war  Mr  Trump began to retreat  After taking office  his tweets on China attacked it for militarism  currency manipulation and unfair trade practices right up until the markets dropped in October  Mr  Trump s first conciliatory tweet came on Nov  1  describing a pleasant chat about trade with President Xi Jinping  and he has been talking up their  incredible relationship  and progress in trade talks since By last month  amid reports that Trump advisers were calculating how big of a  stock market pop  they could expect from a trade deal  Washington insiders from both parties were worrying aloud that the president might accept any deal China would sign Mr  Trump  meanwhile  was executing a similar about face on the Fed  As a candidate  he had attacked the central bank for keeping rates so low and inflating  a big fat ugly bubble  in the markets  Once he took office  Mr  Trump stopped tweeting attacks on the Fed  until November  when he began to blame the central bank for dampening market spirits with high interest rates  In recent weeks  Mr  Trump has not only fulminated about replacing Mr  Powell  he has also started considering market friendly loyalists for seats on the Fed board of governors Mr  Trump s most recent market driven U turn appears to have come on immigration  another subject near and dear to him  So far  the stock markets have not reacted negatively to his aggressive efforts to secure funding for a border wall  including the government shutdown and the declaration of a national emergency  Nonetheless  when Mr  Trump backed off on his threat to close the southern border  the Axios source explained the president s decision this way   It s the markets  Closing the border  the markets would plummet  No president has shown this kind of deference  Jimmy Carter  Ronald Reagan and both Bushes mentioned the stock markets rarely and cautiously  Bill Clinton counseled against responding to their gyrations  In early 2009  Barack Obama suggested it was a good time to buy battered American stocks and was proved right when the markets hit bottom a week later  But Mr  Obama was criticized for acting as  stock picker in chief  and did not talk about stock prices again as president Mr  Trump is not only reading the markets as a daily measure of his success  he is also shaping policy to keep prices high  And recent market rises have rewarded him for it  After Mr  Trump turned conciliatory on China  the Fed announced it was suspending further rate increases  and stocks began climbing back toward record highs So who s in charge  Mr  Trump or the markets  One critical test is the United States China trade talks  which are set to wrap up soon in a meeting between Mr  Trump and Mr  Xi  A tough agreement would help confirm that markets aren t completely dictating policy Even then  Mr  Trump s willingness to bend policy to please the markets is now clear   and it s risky  In recent years the stock markets have grown larger than the economy  and they are now big enough to take the economy down with them when they deflate  Policymakers are wary of poking this beast  but feeding it will only make the markets larger and more demanding Ruchir Sharma  a contributing opinion writer  is chief

It may take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the southern United States border  the government said in court documents filed on Friday A federal judge had asked for a plan to identify these children and their families after a report from government inspectors in January revealed that the Trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents than was previously believed These families were separated before the administration unveiled its  zero tolerance  immigration policy in the spring of 2018  when nearly all adults entering the country illegally were prosecuted and any children accompanying them were put into shelters or foster care To identify these families  the government said it would apply a statistical analysis to about 47 000 children who were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and subsequently discharged  according to the court filing  From there  the government said it would manually review the case records of the children who appeared to have the highest probability of being part of the separated families Officials estimated that the process would take at least one year and potentially two  In explaining the reason for such an arduous process  the government said United States Customs and Border Protection did not collect specific data on migrant family separations before April 2018 Lawyers representing the Office of Refugee Resettlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday In a court filing for the government  Jonathan White  a commander with the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps  wrote that identifying this group of children presented new challenges because they were already discharged from the Office of Refugee Resettlement  meaning the government  lacks access  to them The statistical analysis was required because manually reviewing the cases of nearly 50 000 children would  overwhelm  the office s resources  he wrote The government s proposed plan arose from a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California  In June  Judge Dana M  Sabraw ordered the reunification of children and parents who had been separated under the Trump administration policy  President Trump rescinded the policy that same month ImageRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee  Democrat of Texas  speaking on Capitol Hill in February about the Trump administration s separation policy involving migrant families CreditJose Luis Magana Associated PressAbout 2 800 children have been reunified with their families or situated according to their parents  wishes  said Lee Gelernt  who challenged the policy in court on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union The January report  by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services  revealed that a group of separated families was unaccounted for because the government lacked an effective tracking system  In March  Judge Sabraw ruled that those families should be included in the litigation Mr  Gelernt said this identification process should take months  not years   If the government believed finding these children was a priority  they could do it quicker than two years   Mr  Gelernt said The families the government may now be tasked with locating are those who entered the United States on or after July 1  2017  the earliest known date that families were separated  were detained by immigration officials  and have a child who was detained and then released to a sponsor  such as a relative  before the judge s reunification order on June 26  2018 When the government previously identified children for reunification  it included only the children who were detained at the time of the reunification order Judge Sabraw wrote in his March 8 order that because all of these families had been subjected to the same policies and had been separated under  questionable circumstances   they should have the same opportunity for relief  Although identifying the families may be burdensome  as the government argued   it clearly can be done   the judge wrote According to the government s proposed plan  officials would update the A C L U  about the families  information after completing the analysis and reviewing the children s cases  The organization would then use that information to help reunify parents and children Mr  Gelernt said a two year wait to reunite families would be devastating  The longer these children remained separated from their families  he said  the more psychological trauma they would endure  He said the A C L U  planned to argue against the proposed plan in court The family separations were a central part of the Trump administration s effort to deter migrant families from trying to enter the United States through its southern border with Mexico Data released last month suggested that the administration s immigration measures   including the separation policy and attempts to beef up border security and limit who qualified for asylum   failed to deter tens of thousands of migrants traveling to the United States  most of whom were escaping violence and poverty in Central America  

On Sunday evening  news broke that Kirstjen Nielsen was leaving her job as head of the Department of Homeland Security  The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted that according to people close to Nielsen  one reason she hung on as long as she did was because  she was aware how awful life would will be for her on the outside   given her role in defending Donald Trump s policies Let s make it so Nielsen did not create Trump s monstrous policy of separating migrant families  but she should be known forever as the person who carried it out  She put babies in cages  traumatized children for life  and then appears to have lied to Congress about what she had done  She did this evil work with either blithe incompetence or malicious sloppiness  failing to create a system to properly track kids who were ripped from their families  On Friday  the Trump administration said it could take up to two years to identify thousands of separated migrant children  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt   Now Trump is gearing up to do it again  According to NBC News  for months the president has  urged his administration to reinstate large scale separation of migrant families crossing the border   Nielsen reportedly resisted  citing court rulings and Trump s own 2018 executive order ending his administration s family separation policy  Trump s choice for acting homeland security secretary  Kevin McAleenan  apparently is more open to the idea Should this happen  Congress and some judges will try to intervene  But Trump is growing ever more lawless and autocratic   There is a near systematic purge happening at the nation s second largest national security agency   a senior administration official told CNN on Monday  speaking of D H S  The president is filling positions with acting officials  circumventing Senate confirmation  Some senior members of the administration  like Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  are flatly refusing to cooperate with congressional oversight  CNN reported that Trump told border agents to ignore judges when taking steps to keep migrants out  We should not assume that government institutions will restrain the president before he visits anguish and terror on thousands more of the world s most vulnerable children What happens to Nielsen now can serve as an example to other people in the administration as they decide whether to just follow orders  By this  I don t mean that people should scream at Nielsen in restaurants  Rather  those horrified by family separation should do whatever they can to deny Nielsen the sort of cushy corporate landing or prestigious academic appointment once customary for ex administration officials  The fact that she evidently didn t go as far as an erratic and out of control Trump wanted is immaterial  she should be a pariah for going as far as she did Coincidentally  the day before Nielsen resigned  a coalition of progressive groups signed on to a petition asking corporate America to blacklist senior people in the Trump administration  including Nielsen  who took part in crafting  enacting or defending family separation   Allowing her to seek refuge in a corporate corner office or a boardroom  university  speaking agency or elsewhere poses a significant reputational risk for those involved   said Karl Frisch  a spokesman for Restore Public Trust  the group organizing the campaign How much of a risk will depend on decent Trump hating Americans  The Resistance has been flagging recently  even if abhorrence of Trump s degenerate administration has not  Many people  having worked frantically to deliver the House to Democrats in the midterms  are exhausted  The crackup of the Women s March  and the resulting tensions between some black and Jewish activists  has been deeply dispiriting  The beginning of the Democratic presidential primary has reanimated old intra left animosities  And relentless outrage is hard to sustain  no matter how justified But with the possible return of family separation  the Resistance needs to regroup  and demanding a boycott of Trump officials tainted by baby snatching is a good place to begin  Such a boycott would take advantage of one of the central asymmetries in American life  Rural voters  who tend to be conservative  have disproportionate political power  it s why Trump  who lost the popular vote  is president in the first place  But cosmopolitan progressives have disproportionate economic and cultural power  which is why we have the faintly absurd phenomenon of woke capitalism  That power should be deployed to force the sort of accountability Nielsen reportedly fears  and to serve as a warning to others that the Trump stink never washes off On Monday   Henry Farrell  a professor at George Washington University  wrote that he will boycott any university or think tank that employs Nielsen  and refuse to be on panels with anyone from such an institution  He invited others to join him  It s a small start  but a start  Nielsen should not be permitted to launder her reputation through a fellowship at Harvard  like Corey Lewandowski or Sean Spicer did  She should not get to follow H R  McMaster to Stanford There are plenty of places that will hire a disgraced child torturer   private prisons  which often hold undocumented immigrants  are a big business  And Henry Kissinger s storied social life shows that America s elite is far from inhospitable to ghouls  But as the country hurtles into a dangerous new phase of unbound Trumpism  those who want to say no need to muster whatever leverage they can  including public shame and economic sanctions  Either the leaders of corporate America and academia want to be associated with terrorizing toddlers  or not More from Opinion on Kirstjen Nielsen s departure Opinion   Jamelle Bouie  Who Is Left to Say No to Trump April 8  2019Opinion  U S  Policies Toward

KABUL  Afghanistan   In a sign that a logjam in Afghanistan over entering peace talks with the Taliban could be easing  the Afghan government announced Sunday that it had named a council of senior political leaders who will appoint negotiators  create their mandate for talks and oversee their work The formation of the council   led by President Ashraf Ghani and composed of both current and former senior government officials and leaders of political parties and opposition groups   comes after months of bitter disagreements over the next steps for peace talks with the Taliban So far  negotiations have occurred only between the insurgents and American diplomats  without the Afghan government  an impasse that American officials have struggled to break The two sides are near an agreement on the withdrawal of American troops and on a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil not be used by terrorist groups to attack the United States and its allies  as Al Qaeda did in September 2001  But the United States has insisted that nothing can be finalized until the Taliban and the Afghans figure out the country s political future The Taliban have refused to meet directly with representatives of the Afghan government  calling it a puppet of the United States  The Afghan government has insisted on nothing less than direct negotiations  criticizing any move by political groups to engage with the Taliban as giving the insurgents unwarranted legitimacy Mr  Ghani  in opening the first meeting of the new council  expressed happiness on Sunday and thanked political leaders for creating a unified front under the government s umbrella  With complete unity for the sake of a better future for our country  we will make decisions about the aims of this process and the makeup of the negotiating team   Mr  Ghani said The progress was welcomed by Zalmay Khalilzad  the American Special envoy leading the peace efforts  Mr  Khalilzad spent much of the past week in Kabul trying to urge the Afghan government to introduce an inclusive negotiating team  Ambassador Khalilzad was pleased to see the Afghans with whom he met  inside and outside government  coming together to put peace first   the United States Embassy in Kabul  said in a statement announcing his departure   Ambassador Khalilzad underscored the imperative of reducing violence across Afghanistan in the coming weeks and explored ways to build broader regional support for the current effort to realize the Afghan people s yearning for peace  ImageQatari officials  center  with delegations from the United States and the Taliban in Doha in February CreditMinistry of Foreign Affairs of QatarAfter the new council met  officials expressed their willingness to be flexible to build trust and pave the way for direct negotiations Mohammed Umer Daudzai  a member of the council  said an informal meeting with the Taliban in Qatar  seen as an icebreaker  would go ahead  That meeting  set for mid April and expected to be attended by more than a hundred Afghans from various parts of society  is intended as a trust building measure  It was decided in today s meeting that we will participate in the meeting in Qatar as a joint delegation   Mr  Daudzai said   A big delegation will go to Qatar to exchange views with the other side  which are the Taliban  but they will not negotiate  Negotiation is the next step  Easing Mr  Ghani s concerns is the fact that since he leads the council overseeing the talks  his officials will be on the negotiating team when direct talks with the Taliban do begin  Government representatives are also likely to attend the large Qatar meeting The Taliban  in a statement soon after Mr  Daudzai s comments  made clear that they were still sensitive about talking to the Afghan government  They said that if any officials were part of the delegation in Qatar  they would be attending in a personal capacity  No one will be participating as representatives of the Kabul administration   Zabihullah Mujahid  the Taliban spokesman  said in the statement Although political parties and lawmakers welcomed the progress  many cautioned that it was still fragile  and said Mr  Ghani s office still had many differences with the parties on major issues  including the size and makeup of the negotiating team A leaked initial list of the team published by local news media also raised concerns about just how seriously the Afghan government and political elite were taking the participation of women  Only two women were on a proposed list of 22 negotiators  Today s meeting in the palace could be a good start for building of national consensus on peace   at least now there is a start for decisions on how to go ahead with peace talks   said Mohammad Natiqi  a leader of the Wahdat e Islami Party   But there are still big differences between political parties and the presidential palace  Mohammad Nazeer Ahmadzai  a member of Parliament  said the council created a platform to bridge rifts that benefit the Taliban  He pointed to a meeting in Moscow in February where the Afghan political elite went in large numbers to meet with the insurgents despite strong disagreement from the government  If the meeting in Qatar ends up similar to the meeting in Moscow  it will damage the people s trust in the peace process  and it will show the government weaker and more marginalized   he said  

BEIRUT   Opposition activists and Syrian state media are reporting at least 13 people have been killed in fighting between government forces and insurgents in the northwestern part of Syria An uptick in violence has increasingly tested a Russia Turkey sponsored truce in place since September that has averted a government offensive on insurgent held Idlib and surrounding areas  The area is home to 3 million people The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and first responders known as White Helmets say government shelling killed at least eight people Sunday in Saraqeb and Nairab towns in eastern Idlib A local hospital director  Maher Younis  told the state run Ikhbariya TV that insurgents killed at least five people when they fired missiles at the government held town of Massyaf in the adjacent Hama province  

BRASILIA   The government of Brazil s right wing President Jair Bolsonaro has rejected an appeal by a United Nations expert not to revise Brazilian history by denying a military coup occurred in 1964 In a letter to the U N  human rights commission in Geneva made public on Thursday  the government said it  repudiates the baseless allegations  of the U N  expert who criticized Bolsonaro s decision to commemorate the 1964 military uprising as an attempt to condone rights violations  President Bolsonaro has reiterated his understanding that the 1964 movement was necessary to stave off the growing threat of a communist takeover of Brazil and to ensure the preservation of national institutions in the context of the Cold War   the letter said  According to Bolsonaro  the overthrow of an elected leftist government was not a coup d etat  but a legitimate movement backed by the country s Congress and judiciary  as well as the majority of Brazilians  the letter said Brazil s armed forces on Sunday paid tribute to the 1964 coup that lead to a two decade military dictatorship at the behest of Bolsonaro  who reversed an eight year ban on celebrations  The move stirred debate and underscored Bolsonaro s support for a military government that executed hundreds  tortured thousands  shuttered Congress and left most Brazilians with dark memories of the period Two days earlier in Geneva  Fabian Salvioli  the U N  expert who wrote the letter and a human rights lawyer and professor  called on the Bolsonaro government to reconsider the commemoration   Attempts to revise history and justify or condone gross human rights violations of the past must be clearly rejected by all authorities and society as a whole   Salvioli said Bolsonaro  a former Army captain  has long praised the 1964 85 military government and often said its biggest mistake was not killing enough leftists Pushing the U N  appeal aside  his government is moving ahead with rewriting history  Education Minister Ricardo Velez said in an interview published on Wednesday that school history books will be edited to give a  broader  view of what happened in 1964  He told Valor Economico newspaper that there was no coup and the military regime that followed was not a dictatorship   Reporting by Anthony Boadle  

LONDON   Britain proposed sweeping new government powers to regulate the internet to combat the spread of violent and extremist content  false information and harmful material aimed at children  The proposal  announced on Monday  would be one of the world s most aggressive actions to rein in the most corrosive online content The recommendations  backed by Prime Minister Theresa May  take direct aim at Facebook  Google and other large internet platforms that policymakers believe have made growth and profits a priority over curbing harmful material  The government called for naming an internet regulator with the power to issue fines  block access to websites if necessary and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content spread on their platforms  The internet can be brilliant at connecting people across the world  but for too long these companies have not done enough to protect users  especially children and young people  from harmful content   Ms  May said in a statement   That is not good enough  and it is time to do things differently  By introducing the proposal even as a deadline nears for Britain to exit the European Union  Ms  May signaled that enacting the new internet regulations was a high priority of her government Around the world  governments are having a broader debate about reining in the internet and whether their actions will restrict free expression  Frustrated by what they see as a lack of progress to protect users  governments are passing or considering new laws to define what classifies as acceptable online communication  Advocates for human rights and free speech warn that the policies will lead to censorship and be exploited by more repressive governments After the massacre of 50 people at two   mosques in New Zealand in March  calls have increased globally for internet regulation  The authorities say the gunman distributed a racist manifesto online before using Facebook to live stream the shooting  In response  Australia passed a law last week that threatens fines for social media companies and jail for their executives if they fail to rapidly remove  abhorrent violent material  from their platforms  New Zealand is also considering new restrictions In Singapore  draft legislation was introduced last week that supporters said would restrict the spread of false and misleading information  But opponents have warned it could be used to go after critics of the government  India has also proposed broad new powers to regulate internet content  The European Union is debating a new terrorism content measure that some have warned is overly broad and will harm free expression  And Germany last year began prohibiting hate speech  Digital rights groups have criticized the law as leading to the unnecessary blocking of legitimate content In response to the political backlash  internet companies have toughened their policies and hired tens of thousands of human moderators to screen for problematic material  But with billions of pieces of content being shared each day on services like Facebook  Instagram and YouTube  deciphering what is harmful isn t always an easy task  and governments have criticized the companies for not being aggressive enough ImageBy introducing a proposal to regulate the internet even as a deadline nears for Britain to exit the European Union  Prime Minister Theresa May signaled that the issue was a high priority of her government CreditDowning Street  via Associated PressIn recent weeks  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has said new regulations are needed  particularly to more clearly define what is acceptable content so companies aren t the main judges And Facebook took a similar stance in response to the British proposal   New regulations are needed so that we have a standardized approach across platforms and private companies aren t making so many important decisions alone   Facebook said in a statement   These are complex issues to get right and we look forward to working with the government and Parliament to ensure new regulations are effective  Claire Lilley  a public policy manager for Google  said the company has invested in new technology and hired experts to address the problems raised by the government  and will work with policymakers to  to ensure a free  open and safer internet that works for everyone  Twitter said in a statement that it would  engage in the discussion between industry and the U K  government  as well as work to strike an appropriate balance between keeping users safe and preserving the internet s open  free nature  British officials are calling for the creation of a mandatory  duty of care  standard intended  to make companies take responsibility for the safety of their users and to tackle harm caused by content or activity on their services  The government listed a number of topics that companies could be required to address or risk fines and other penalties  The list includes material thought to be supporting terrorism  inciting violence  encouraging suicide  disinformation  cyberbullying and inappropriate material accessible to children  The rules would apply to social media platforms  discussion forums  messaging services and search engines The proposal is a first step in a longer legislative process  The recommendations will be debated over the coming months before any new laws and regulations are put in place Actions in Britain and elsewhere signal a new era for the internet  Western democracies have largely avoided regulating online communication  But as evidence mounts that online actions are having harmful real life consequences by contributing to violence  compromising elections and spreading hateful ideologies  governments are becoming more willing to intervene In the United States  where free speech is more of a core value than other nations  there s been less momentum to regulate internet content  But in Washington this week  the House Judiciary Committee will question executives from Facebook and Google on the spread of white nationalism on social media  The era of self regulation for online companies is over   Jeremy Wright  Britain s digital secretary  said in a statement   Voluntary actions from industry to tackle online harms have not been applied consistently or gone far enough   Technology   he added   can be an incredible force for good and we want the sector to be part of the solution in protecting their users  However  those that fail to do this will face tough action   

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  He has traveled to three early presidential primary states  held  5 000 a plate events for donors and hired a small dollar fund raising consultant He spoke at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  a pro Israel lobbying group  and is now on another trip to raise money in Boston  after which he will meet with Democratic activists in Las Vegas These are the concrete steps of a man preparing to run for president But thus far  that man  Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City  would prefer that his words speak louder than his actions  When asked if he plans to run for president  he gives the same answers  He is  not ruling anything out   and will consult with his family before making a decision  one that he says will come  sooner than later  Bank on sooner Mr  de Blasio has had two City Hall aides working on his tentative campaign on their own time  one of them  Mike Casca  is a veteran of Senator Bernie Sanders s 2016 presidential campaign  and worked in the senator s office The other mayoral aide helping Mr  de Blasio with his 2020 exploration is Jon Paul Lupo  last month  Mr  Lupo brought aboard Trilogy Interactive  a Washington  D C  based company that does digital fund raising and marketing for political campaigns and others  to assist the mayor s national political action committee  Fairness PAC Mr  de Blasio created Fairness PAC to fund national Democratic candidates  and to pay for his and his wife s political travel outside of New York  The fund raised just over  600 000 last year and has spent almost as much Stacey Bashara  a partner in Trilogy  said that the company s first task would be to reinvigorate and build out the PAC s email list  She said she has not spoken with the mayor  or discussed his potential 2020 run  The work we ve been hired to do is for Fairness PAC   Ms  Bashara said   There s been no conversation beyond that  His potential candidacy has not caused much enthusiasm  even in New York  A poll released this week from Quinnipiac University found that 76 percent of New York City voters believe the mayor should not run for president  Another 47 percent of voters surveyed said they think a de Blasio presidential run would be bad for the city  including 43 percent of Democrats ImageLast month  the mayor spoke to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington  D C CreditMark Wilson Getty ImagesNone of that seems to be deterring Mr  de Blasio  I m glad I could unify the people of New York City   the mayor said at a news conference on Thursday when asked about the Quinnipiac poll That was in keeping with his generally dismissive response to polls that point to his unpopularity   I have spent a lot of time in dead last in many a poll in many a race   the mayor told The New York Times after a January appearance in Iowa   It s not where you start  It s where you end  He repeated that message as recently as this week  when Mr  de Blasio appeared at the National Action Network s annual convention  a popular destination for presidential aspirants  Time and time again  people will tell you what you can t do   the mayor said   But don t let anyone tell you what you can t do  Don t let anyone talk you out of your own power  For all his public disregard of polls  Mr  de Blasio is no doubt aware that his chances of qualifying for the first of the Democratic presidential debates  which will take place in June  may hinge on how he does with poll respondents  Candidates can qualify either by meeting fund raising goals or by gaining at least 1 percent support in three polls of Democratic voters  by any of several organizations approved by the Democratic National Committee By that measure  Mr  de Blasio is two thirds of the way there  He met the 1 percent threshold in a poll released on March 11 by Monmouth University and another released on March 24 by Fox News  I feel like he s going to run   said Rebecca Katz  a former adviser to Mr  de Blasio and his family who is not currently attached to his exploratory bid   I think he wants to be talked about in a serious way  A  5 000 per plate fund raising breakfast on March 6 underscored the mayor s intentions  It was hosted by a real estate developer  Aby Rosen  whose company  RFR Holding  recently bought the Chrysler Building  This will be a private opportunity for a candid conversation with the mayor  who will share his insights and take your questions on the future of the New York City economy and the political trajectory of the Democratic Party  both nationally and locally   said the emailed invitation  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times It said that the mayor had  a lot of value to add on how to navigate successfully this fraught political moment  ImageMr  de Blasio seemed to enjoy the chance to sign autographs and talk with guests after the Asian   Latino Coalition in Des Moines in February CreditScott Morgan for The New York TimesA similar breakfast event took place Friday at the offices of Suffolk Construction in Boston  The company has been looking to expand its operations in New York  Later Friday  the mayor traveled to meet Democrats in Nevada  Read more about the fund raiser hosted by a company looking to expand its footprint in New York City  For what it s worth  Mr  de Blasio does seem to be enjoying himself on the prospective campaign trail  in contrast to his often dour demeanor when parrying with reporters in New York In Des Moines  Mr  de Blasio  a devoted Red Sox fan  signed a Yankees batting helmet for a young fan  He stayed so long speaking with people after a speech at the Asian   Latino Coalition PAC that his staff members had to pull him away so he would not miss his flight back to New York City On the trips to South Carolina and New Hampshire  the mayor was accompanied by his wife  Chirlane McCray  in New Hampshire  the couple visited the home where Ms  McCray s mother was raised  and she led a round table discussion about opioid abuse and mental illness  I ve never seen a political race that the mayor has been involved in   going back to the school board   where Chirlane wasn t a part of the decision making process  the strategy and the tactics   said Peter Ragone  a former top aide and now an informal adviser to Mr  de Blasio Mr  Ragone said he did not know whether Mr  de Blasio would run for president   But if you look at his record and who s in the Democratic primary  why shouldn t he consider it   Mr  Ragone said At the National Action Network  the civil rights group founded by the Rev  Al Sharpton  the mayor seemed extraordinarily animated  and talked about the  painful intersection of structural racism and income inequality   More Democratic candidates for president have been addressing issues of racial inequality  My mission when I became the mayor of the largest city in the nation was to show that the status quo was unacceptable   the mayor said   And isn t that a truth in our nation right now  Mr  Sharpton  a political ally of the mayor  said that Mr  de Blasio told him that he was exploring a run for president because he was being encouraged to do so The mayor did not say who was encouraging him  Mr  Sharpton said  In a crowded field he has some unique things  He s progressive and has management skills  The question is   Does he distinguish himself    Mr  Sharpton said   He s been underestimated before in the mayor s race  so I would not count him out   

WASHINGTON   The House passed legislation on Wednesday that would guarantee broadband internet users equal access to online content  in a crucial step toward bringing back so called net neutrality regulations overturned at the start of the Trump administration In a 232 to 190 vote  divided along party lines  the Democratic majority made good on a promise that became a rallying cry in many progressive circles during the 2018 election  It is also expected to be held up as an issue by Democrats in 2020 But the legislation  the Save the Internet Act  faces long odds in the Republican led Senate  The Senate leader  Mitch McConnell  said this week that the legislation would be  dead on arrival   Earlier this week  the Office of Management and Budget advised the White House to veto the law if it reached the president s desk  The office said in a letter that since the law had been overturned  the broadband industry had thrived  a good sign of how deregulation helped the economy The legislation would prohibit blocking and throttling web traffic and would categorize broadband as a service open to heavy regulation  Supporters say the regulation would prevent companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of content like videos  Opponents say it would strap broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast with heavy handed restrictions  and could lead to price controls  We need a law that puts a cop on the beat who will enforce the laws  because we can t just rely on internet providers to say this will be a free and open internet   Representative Frank Pallone  Democrat of New Jersey  said in an interview   No one believes them  ImageAjit Pai  chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  rolled back net neutrality rules in 2017 CreditJacquelyn Martin Associated PressThe Federal Communications Commission rolled back the country s net neutrality rules in November 2017  Shortly after  internet companies and public interest groups sued to overturn the action  which was led by Ajit Pai  the agency s chairman In addition  more than two dozen states have raced to create their own net neutrality laws  The Justice Department and telecommunications companies have  in turn  sued to block the state efforts Net neutrality  a regulatory idea hatched by academics  has been a decade long battle pitting Silicon Valley and consumer groups against the telecommunications sector  Companies like Google  Mozilla and Facebook have argued that without rules  telecommunications companies can become gatekeepers of online content by choosing the quality of the delivery of web services in a way that could hurt rivals and consumers  The Obama administration sided with their argument  with the F C C  approving new regulations in 2015 Now  the companies are pushing for a law on the issue  A group of 120 start ups  including Stripe  Medium  and GitHub  wrote a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders in support of the bill  Net neutrality is fundamental to guaranteeing that every American has unencumbered access to the internet   the companies wrote   This access is also essential to a competitive  free market for the technology economy to thrive as well as entrepreneurship in this country  The biggest disagreement between Republicans and Democrats is whether broadband should be considered a utility like phone service  Republicans say that doing so could lead to the possible regulation of broadband rates  Democrats say the categorization is an important update that recognizes the importance of broadband to the economy  culture and education  Some in Congress are trying to give the government more control again  applying utility style regulations that would threaten the internet as we know it  We should reject these efforts   Senator Roger Wicker  Republican of Mississippi  said on the Senate floor last week

TOKYO   Japan appears to have dodged a thanks to resilient business spending but tanking factory and export sectors and a lack of policy options leave it particularly vulnerable if a projected recovery in the global economy fails to materialise If domestic growth crumbles  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could postpone yet again a scheduled sales tax hike in October or offer a modest increase in fiscal spending  some analysts say The Bank of Japan  too  may be forced to ramp up monetary support  though many analysts say the central bank is left with few effective tools to prop up growth While the chances of such actions are small  they cannot be ruled out given Japan s exposure to economic swings in big export destinations like China  analysts say  Chances are fifty fifty that Abe may delay the sales tax hike again   said Takeshi Minami  chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute  who see a 70 percent chance Japan may slide into recession  If the sales tax is delayed  the BOJ would come under pressure for further easing  More extreme steps like using government spending as a primary policy tool to boost employment and spur inflation   an idea dubbed  Modern Monetary Theory   MMT  backed by some U S  academics and politicians   are off the table for now  government officials say  There is no sense that someone is going to latch onto this and push for a huge increase in fiscal spending   a government official with direct knowledge on economic policy making said  when asked by Reuters about MMT  However  the government s position is that fiscal and monetary policy need to work together   the official said  adding that the priority for government officials is to deal with any downside shocks with additional fiscal spending Factory output and exports slumped in January due to a bruising U S  China trade war  forcing the government to cut its economic assessment in March for the first time in three years But the government held off from declaring Japan in a recession  Central bank policymakers also saw relief in the BOJ s  tankan  survey last week that showed companies were maintaining their robust capital expenditure plans Still  government and central bank policymakers worry that the global slowdown  if it persists  may eventually prompt firms to delay investment  say sources familiar with their thinking  External headwinds aren t hurting capital expenditure yet  so Japan can still expect a second half rebound in growth   said one of the sources   But uncertainty is high   the source said  adding that much will depend on how quickly global growth   notably China s economy   will pick up Abe has said he will go ahead with a twice delayed increase in the sales tax rate to 10 percent from 8 percent in October unless a shock to the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 hits the global economy The government has already earmarked roughly 2 trillion yen   17 95 billion  in spending to mitigate the pain  raising the threshold to postpone the tax hike again  But some analysts say another delay could not be ruled out as Abe faces an upper house election in the summer The BOJ could be asked upon to ramp up stimulus  though it is running out of ammunition and facing criticism that prolonged easing is inflicting too much pain on financial institutions With the cost of its stimulus rising  the BOJ may be left to rely on words rather than action to bolster the business mood and prevent unwelcome yen rises that hurt exports  some analysts say  The BOJ is running out of options     It has to sound dovish to prevent the yen from rising   said Hiroaki Muto  senior economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center  The first step would be using forward guidance to show the direction is toward easing and normalisation is very much in the distance    1   111 4400 yen   Additional reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto and Kaori Kaneko  Editing by Sam Holmes

Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  Last night  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen found herself on the receiving end of what has become a common occurrence in the Trump era  pushed out of office unceremoniously  with her departure announced in a tweet Unlike some of the

circumstances  like a bad thing  In the Trump administration  though  some have seen it as the only way out while saving your reputation  Take Ms  Nielsen  for example  Though her legacy is likely linked with the president s policies on separating migrant families at the border  her dismissal allows her to argue that she objected internally   and lost the fight   over some of the president s

HARARE   Zimbabwe is to start paying compensation this year to thousands of white farmers who lost land under former president Robert Mugabe s land reform nearly two decades ago  the government said  as it seeks to bring closure to a highly divisive issue Two decades ago Mugabe s government carried out at times violent evictions of 4 500 white farmers and redistributed the land to around 300 000 black families  arguing it was redressing imbalances from the colonial era But land reform still divides public opinion as opponents see it as a partisan process that left the country struggling to feed itself  President Emmerson Mnangagwa s government sees the paying of compensation to white farmers as key to mend ties with the West  and set aside  17 5 million in this year s budget to that end  The initial payments will target those in financial distress  while full compensation will be paid later  The registration process and list of farmers should be completed by the end of April 2019  after which the interim advance payments will be paid directly to former farm owners   Zimbabwe s ministries of finance and agriculture said in a joint statement on Monday They said the process to identify and register farmers for compensation was being undertaken the Commercial Farmers Union  CFU  and a committee representing the farmers A committee comprising government officials and former farm owners is currently valuing improvements made on the farms  That process should end next month and will determine the full amount due to the farmers The government  which maintains it will only pay compensation for infrastructure and improvements on farms and not for the land  is talking to international financial institutions on options to raise the full amount to pay farmers Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980  while many blacks were landless   Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe  Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration plans to aggressively push for tougher screening of asylum seekers that will make it vastly more difficult for migrants fleeing persecution in their home countries to win protection in the United States  a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday The official said that President Trump ordered a shake up of his top immigration officials in recent days because they were moving too slowly  or even actively obstructing  the president s desire to confront the surge of migrants at the southwestern border  The asylum changes are among many policies the president wants to put into effect with a new team in place  the official said Mr  Trump denied on Tuesday that one of those changes would be to restart his policy of separating migrant families at the border  though he said that the act of taking children from their parents   which drew global condemnation before he abandoned it last summer   was effective  Now I ll tell you something  once you don t have it  that s why you see many more people coming   Mr  Trump said   They are coming like it s a picnic  because   Let s go to Disneyland   The administration official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity even as Mr  Trump was making his remarks  said a modified version of family separation  in which parents are given a choice of whether to be separated or to accept indefinite detention alongside their children  continues to be under consideration But the so called binary choice proposal is  not ripe for White House consideration  right now  he insisted  because the government does not currently have the detention space to hold families if the policy were put in place The asylum changes being envisioned could drastically alter the role that the United States plays as a refuge for people fleeing poverty  violence and war  American and international laws require it to allow migrants to request asylum once they come to the country But the official said that an initial assessment of the basis for a request for asylum   known as a  credible fear  screening   too often accepts the claim that the migrant was persecuted  The official also said that many more asylum seekers should be rejected during that first step Out of 97 728 completed interviews with migrants in the fiscal year that ended on Sept  30  2018  the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services confirmed a credible fear of persecution 74 677 times  according to an agency official Changes in the screening process could drastically lower those findings by requiring more proof from asylum seekers that they would be persecuted in their home countries  Screeners could also try to verify migrant claims by using State Department assessments of the threats that exist in those countries Immigrant rights advocates have feared for months that the administration would try to change the standards by which asylum seekers are judged in an effort to prevent more of them from coming into the United States The administration official blamed the delay in that effort on  deep state  bureaucrats at the Department of Homeland Security and even the president s own political appointees in the department  whom the official described as lacking the management skills to push Mr  Trump s agenda The official declined to name specific administration officials who have failed  But he made thinly veiled references to two top officials at the Department of Homeland Security  John Mitnick  the department s general counsel  and L  Francis Cissna  the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services He said there was  clearly a track record  in which the president s policies have not been advanced In his remarks on Tuesday  Mr  Trump falsely said that President Barack Obama had embraced the same policy of routinely separating migrant children from their parents at the border  President Obama had child separation   Mr  Trump said during brief remarks in the Oval Office  where he was meeting with President Abdel Fattah el Sisi of Egypt   I m the one that stopped it  Under Mr  Obama and President George W  Bush  immigration officials sometimes separated families when they had reason to question parentage or when there was evidence of child abuse  The Trump administration instituted a policy in which all families who crossed the border illegally were separated in order to allow the parents to be prosecuted under the administration s  zero tolerance  policy  More than 2 700 children were separated from their parents at the border before Mr  Trump ended the policy in June 2018  Fact check  Family separation at the border The president s comments come after he shook up the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security  forcing the resignation of the secretary  Kirstjen Nielsen  and top immigration officials in a move that signaled a pending shift in immigration policies Also on Tuesday  the acting deputy secretary of homeland security  Claire Grady  who was next in line by law to become the acting secretary  submitted her resignation  according to a Twitter post by Ms  Nielsen  Ms  Grady s resignation paves the way for Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  to take the role Customs and Border Protection officials this week underscored Mr  Trump s concern about illegal immigration by announcing that more than 103 000 migrants crossed the southwestern border in March without authorization  an increase from the more than 76 000 migrants who crossed in February  Just last month  we saw record numbers of family units and unaccompanied juvenile apprehensions in February  and unfortunately  March apprehension numbers are again record setting and cause dire concerns for us   said Brian Hastings  the chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Most of the migrants   92 000 of the 103 000   were apprehended by Border Patrol agents  meaning they crossed in between the ports of entry More than 53 000 of those migrants were members of a family  Mr  Hastings said  and most of those families were from Honduras  Guatemala or El Salvador In the first half of fiscal year 2019  Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 385 000 migrants on the border  more than double those apprehended during the same time last year Mr  Hastings said the Border Patrol can generally maintain 4 500 people in its custody  But it recently counted 13 000 migrants in its facilities  and he said the overflow has led to the release of families into cities along the border  Backups have resulted in individuals spending additional time in Border Patrol custody in increasingly crowded conditions   Mr  Hastings said On Tuesday  White House officials announced that the president would appeal a judge s ruling that blocked the administration s  Migrant Protection Protocols   which require some asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while they wait for their court cases Mr  Trump has recently commended Mexico for doing more to stem migration to the border  but the officials said they have not seen any effect on the number of people crossing it   The numbers aren t declining  in fact  we re still seeing 3 000 apprehensions per day   Mr  Hastings said Officials also revealed that among the tens of thousands of family members approaching the border each month  just 3 100 people who said they were traveling with relatives were found to have a fraudulent claim  Those people either said they had a child when the individual was over 18 or the group s members were not really related

Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter WASHINGTON   As the Trump administration prepares to drastically weaken Obama era rules restricting vehicle pollution  nervous automakers are devising a strategy to handle their worst case scenario  a divided American auto market  with some states following President Trump s weakened rules while others stick with the tougher ones The effort is increasingly urgent because the Trump administration has now settled on the key details of its rollback plan  according to two people familiar with the matter  The new rules would all but eliminate the Obama era restrictions  essentially freezing standards at about 37 miles per gallon  compared to 54 5 miles per gallon required by the current rules  The policy makes it a near certainty that California and 13 other states  collectively representing roughly one third of the United States auto market  will keep enforcing the stricter rules  splitting the national auto market in two Although Mr  Trump has billed his rollback as a boon to the auto industry  automakers say the split market outcome would be a logistical and financial nightmare for them  Their current strategy centers on selling completely different kinds of cars in different parts of the country   chiefly hybrids or electric vehicles in states like California  and less efficient SUVs  which American car buyers love  in other states But automakers recognize it would be easy for some buyers to simply cross state lines to buy what they want  We could see a scenario where there are limited choices for consumers in the high fuel economy states  or a stampede at the border to buy cars in the states that follow the federal standards   said Gloria Bergquist  a vice president at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  In that case  Ms  Bergquist said  states with stricter standards might have to create new rules against buying cars from other states   Because this is all such new territory  no one s quite sure how this is going to work   she said   We re trying to figure it out  But it s going to be a headache  Automakers have told White House officials that they dread this split market outcome  but it appears increasingly likely because California and the 13 other states that follow its strict state pollution rules have said they plan to sue the White House in order to keep the current standards in place The industry had initially asked Mr  Trump to loosen the auto pollution rules  which were among Mr  Obama s signature policies aimed at fighting climate change  However  the companies also asked that Mr  Trump strike a deal with California and the other states to maintain a single national standard  But the White House has stopped negotiating with California The administration has settled on the key details of its rollback  according to two people familiar with the terms  The plan  which is being jointly written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department  would require automakers to raise the fuel economy of their fleets by about 1 percent annually between 2021 and 2026  according to these people  That would be a sharp reduction from the 5 percent annual increase now required In addition  the Trump plan would also give automakers credits for using cleaner technologies  like more modern refrigerants in air conditioners  something that most already do  The Trump plan would also revoke the legal right of California and other states to set their own  stronger standards  setting up the legal clash between the federal government and the states The plan is expected to be published in the next few months  at which point it formally goes into effect  The president has made it clear he wants automakers to publicly support the rollback when it is announced   Every administration wants the industry to stand with them in the Rose Garden   Ms  Bergquist said   But regulatory certainty is really important for automakers  If the nation s auto market does get split in two  the challenge for automakers will come specifically in figuring out how to sell a radically different mix of cars in different states  For example  in states like California  automakers would have to demonstrate that the average mileage of all the cars they sell is much higher  about 54 miles per gallon by 2025  than in states like Utah  where the new Trump standard of about 38 miles per gallon would be in effect  But because Americans have shown a growing preference for SUVs over thriftier vehicles like electrics  manufacturers might have to significantly cut prices on electric vehicles in the high mileage states  a potentially money losing proposition for them  while raising the prices of gas guzzlers  Meanwhile  auto lots in low mileage states might hold a completely different mix of cars at different prices  If car buyers simply cross state lines to buy gas guzzlers and bring them into the cleaner standard states  it could create more regulatory headaches for the companies  which could also be subject to fines from high mileage states if they fail to comply Representatives of Ford and General Motors  who spoke on condition of anonymity because the administration s final plans have not been made public  said their companies felt torn between backing the Trump plan  which could hurt their bottom line  or opposing it and siding with California  which could bring retaliation from Mr  Trump In particular  automakers fear that the administration would retaliate against them by imposing trade sanctions like tariffs on auto imports  That could raise the cost of American vehicles  many of which are manufactured overseas A recent a draft report from the Commerce Department concluded that auto imports threaten national security  according to one person who viewed it  A final version of that report has been sent to the White House  and while it has not been made public  the conclusion that auto imports are a national security threat would pave the way for Mr  Trump to impose tariffs on auto imports  They will have to choose between Trump and California   said Margo T  Oge  a former senior E P A  official who works on auto pollution policy issues  If you go with Trump  it solves the short term temper tantrum and the threat of trade wars on the horizon   she said   But that is also taking a big legal risk  Because in the long term  California could win the legal fight to keep its state standards  Trump is right now  but California is forever  Mr  Trump has frequently turned to tariffs on foreign products as a wide ranging source of leverage to try to exact concessions from both foreign governments and multinational companies A senior White House official  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record  said the White House still hoped to have the auto industry s backing and was unaware of plans to use trade sanctions as leverage or punishment   The auto industry is important to the White House   the official said   The agencies are still working through the rule making process and no final decisions have been made  In interviews  California officials who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record  noted that California already has in place border laws requiring vehicles brought into the state to meet certain pollution standards  California is prepared to strike at any blow dealt our way and regardless of what comes next  we have laws in place to

the plan  they are months from completing the accompanying legal and technical documents required to justify such a major rule change  according to three people familiar with the plan  Those people noted that the process of creating the documents was stalled by the 35 day government shutdown earlier this year ImageAndrew R  Wheeler  administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThose document delays mean the final plan is unlikely to be made public until at least late spring or early summer  these people said  The release date is significant because it would prompt the expected legal battle  which is likely to end up before the Supreme Court  But if the plan isn t released until this summer  it means the legal challenges aren t likely to reach the Supreme Court during Mr  Trump s first term in office The risk is that  should a Democrat defeat Mr  Trump in his re election bid  the new administration could simply decline to defend the plan in court  The longer they wait on this  the easier it will be for the next administration to undo it   said Jody Freeman  a professor of environmental law at Harvard University who

settling in Las Vegas Now  25 years later  Mr  Pupo is following roughly the same path  Incredible   said Mr  Pupo  40  marveling at how his family s history was repeating itself I spoke with Mr  Pupo and his wife  Yaima Garca  37  this week in an evangelical church that had been converted into a temporary migrant shelter  The building  a cinder block warehouse that previously served as a hardware store  was tucked in a scrappy  semi industrial neighborhood of this border city in northern Mexico The couple s journey had come to an abrupt halt here a month ago when their quest for sanctuary in the United States ran up against the cold realities of the border  They are now among many thousands who are waiting in Ciudad Jurez and other border cities for their chance to apply for asylum in the United States It s a quirk of current migratory patterns that Mr  Pupo and Ms  Garca also find themselves among many other Cuban asylum seekers in Ciudad Jurez  By the estimates of government officials  as many as 70 percent of the more than 3 000 migrants waiting here to apply for asylum across the border in El Paso  are Cuban In other border cities  those waiting to cross are mostly Central Americans  The Cuban always tries to be in a group   Ms  Garca explained   I see it as a form of protection How Ciudad Jurez came to be the preferred crossing point for Cubans remains a mystery  But migrants say that it has the reputation for being safer for migrants and less crowded with asylum seekers than other popular crossing points  Word traveled through the Cuban migrant grapevine   in WhatsApp messaging groups  by phone and on social media While Cubans have been a common sight for years on the migrant trail through Mexico  their numbers rising and falling in response to events back home and shifts in American policy  the flow appeared to pick up in recent months Officials here in Ciudad Jurez said they began registering a sharp increase in the number of Cuban asylum seekers in late fall The Cubans  by and large  say they are fleeing political repression in the Caribbean nation  Cubans seeking sanctuary used to get special treatment in the United States  Under a policy known as  wet foot  dry foot   Cubans who made it to American soil were allowed to stay and eventually apply for permanent residency  But the Obama administration halted those privileges in January 2017  and since then Cuban asylum seekers have been like everyone else In Ciudad Jurez  they have run up against a Trump administration system that limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at ports of entry  This practice has given rise to informal waiting lists in border towns So  the Cubans and others are biding their time   in migrant shelters  in budget hotels and in cheap  rented rooms   and suppressing the impulse to hire a smuggler and cross illegally ImageErnesto Velasquez Lopez  from Cuba  cried tears of joy in Ciudad Jurez after receiving notice that his asylum case will be heard by the United States CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesMr  Pupo and Ms  Garca left Cuba on Feb  6  flew to Panama and traveled overland to Mexico  arriving in Ciudad Jurez on March 1 and finding their way to Solus Christus Church The shelter is overseen by Lilia and Rodolfo Barraza  who opened its doors to migrants on Feb  26 after local officials appealed for help in absorbing the flow of asylum seekers into the city Mr  Barraza  65  a pastor  said that initially he had been inclined to say no  but he remembered a biblical passage that described the moral obligation to do good  And when I thought of that biblical verse  I said   Bring them    Mr  Barraza recalled   And the next day they were here  The couple has hosted as many as 74 migrants at one time  jammed into a space suitable for far less  there are currently 38  all but one of them Cubans   The exception is a Venezuelan woman  Ms  Barraza  61  said that before they had opened their doors  she had never met a Cuban   But now I think they re beautiful   she said   We love them  They are our brothers and sisters  The symbolic focus of the space is a white board on which is written the waiting list number of the last migrant allowed to cross the border and present themselves to the American authorities  A migrant s number in line has become almost as important as any other piece of data in their life When a migrant s number is called and they successfully cross  it s a bittersweet moment for those who remain behind  They lose a traveling partner but move one step closer to their own appointment  It could be a week  two weeks  a month   Ms  Garca mused on a recent afternoon at the shelter The number on the board was 6995  Her number is 7533  Mr  Pupo s is 7534 For now  Mr  Pupo added   this is our refuge  Kirk is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border  Each week they ll be sharing a

week   When I walked in there  it ripped your guts out   he said   It made you cry  CreditAl Drago for The New York TimesMCALLEN  Tex    The Border Patrol s largest detention center has swelled in recent weeks amid an influx of migrant families from Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador  The processing center in the border city of McAllen has frequently exceeded its capacity  leading to mass releases of migrants that have overwhelmed nonprofit shelters The building  known informally as Ursula because of its Ursula Avenue address  has been criticized by immigrant advocates for holding migrants in large pens made of chain link fencing   Manny Fernandez  the New York Times Houston bureau chief  spoke to Senator Jon Tester  a Montana Democrat who spent more than an hour touring the Ursula facility last week The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation Q  What was it like A  I was there on Sunday  March 24   I m not going to talk to you like most Democrats will talk to you  I m going to tell you that  when I walked in there  it ripped your guts out  It made you cry  It did all those things that people say it did to you  because you had children and you had mothers  I looked at them as kids the same age as my grandkids  On the other side of the equation  there were a lot of people in a fairly small area  and the ventilation had to be pretty darn good because it didn t stink How many migrants were there at the time Twenty two hundred  And their capacity is 1 500 Did it feel overcrowded or just crowded Gosh  you re asking the wrong guy  because this is the first time I ve been in that processing center  It felt crowded Can you describe it It s a metal building that s insulated  Each one of the holding areas had a bathroom and a sink  They re held by sex  of course  And then the families were held in different steel cages  basically  Everybody had a blanket that wanted one  Mylar blankets  Most of them were laying down on mats  Some of them were standing up  Some of them were sitting on benches What were Border Patrol officials saying about all this They said they were processing them through as quick as they could  They said the manpower they were using here was manpower that they d rather have on the border  but nonetheless they had to process these folks  Look  I mean  I don t like prisons  I don t like holding people up  But the bottom line is that I don t have any better idea than the way they were doing it  and I asked them if they did and they didn t either  although they were tasked with trying to find a better way to do it  They were providing food and water and baby formula  and were treating these folks as good as they could treat them  in the conditions that were there  I m simply just not critical of Border Protection in this situation because I don t know what the solution is Some Democrats were calling the mass releases a manufactured attempt to fuel the crisis at the border narrative  Do you agree I don t think I can agree with it  Look  I m not a conspiracy theorist  I think I have to go with what I saw  and what I saw literally was a bunch of families in this facility and I think it is what it is right now  The direction I would take it is  what are the push factors in these countries that are pushing these families to our southern border Was Border Patrol cooperative during the tour They were absolutely cooperative  I ve been on these trips before  and I know for a fact they show you want they want you to see  But they were very cooperative Were the conditions horrible  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder  I guess  I don t think they were horrible  but by the same token it was gut wrenching to see mothers and children sitting there in cages It sounds like it was packed but people still had some room I don t know how many square feet each person needs to determine whether it was overflowed or packed or beyond the pale  I just know as I looked there  there was some space and people could mill around  although it was very crowded  It would drive me crazy  My nearest neighbor is a mile away  It would drive me nuts The president on the borderImageMexico supplies many of the avocados eaten in the United States CreditJustin Sullivan Getty ImagesPresident Trump visited a portion of the border wall in California on Friday  a day after backing off a threat to close the border with Mexico The president  floated the idea of closing the border last week   defending it repeatedly here and here   even as economic experts warned doing so could damage the economy  The agricultural and manufacturing industries would have been especially hard hit by a closing  including a potential avocado shortage  Instead  on Thursday  Mr  Trump said he would give Mexico a  one year warning  before closing the border  If the drugs don t stop or aren t largely stopped  we re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products  in particular cars   the whole ballgame is cars   he said   And if that doesn t stop the drugs  we close the border  Read earlier installments of Crossing the Border here  Sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox

NEW DELHI   The Indian government may have to make a series of major changes at the top of the nation s civil service if Prime Minister Narendra Modi is re elected to a second term in May  according to multiple sources in the administration At least eight senior bureaucrats in the prime minister s office have either sought a transfer to other departments or plan to take premature retirement  three government officials said  The officials  from the prime minister s office  the home  interior  ministry and the foreign ministry  declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject Two of them said they too are keen to be transferred to state capitals or to other jobs  They said officials in several ministries were trying to move  but did not have a number There are about 25 senior civil servants working in the prime minister s office  which under Modi has become the single most powerful department in government The three officials said the reasons for wanting out are almost all the same  Many top bureaucrats complained about two aspects of the Modi administration   their inability to influence government policy as it is largely controlled and set by the prime minister and a small group of ministers and advisers  and the demanding work schedule they face  The sense of partnership is missing  Modi and his ministers do not have an organic relationship with the bureaucrats   said the civil servant in the home ministry  Sanjay Mayukh  a spokesman for Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   declined to comment on the grounds that governance issues were managed directly by ministers A spokesman in the prime minister s office did not return phone calls seeking comment To be sure  some other major governments around the world often face a series of departures and changes  especially when a first term morphs into a second term  Also  just because an official talks about quitting doesn t mean they will  But in India  officials in the prime minister s office are hand picked for loyalty and tend to stay if the administration is re elected  Modi s BJP led alliance is tipped to win a slim majority in the April May general election  pollsters say  Senior bureaucrats said Modi s top down approach  and his orders to work on public holidays  to demand they submit details of their assets  and to clean their own workplaces at the start of a five year cleanliness campaign in 2014  has widened the gap between the civil servants and the nation s leader Amit Shah  a close aide of Modi and the head of the BJP  in a closed door meeting attended by two ministers in February said bureaucrats continued to suffer from  communist romanticism   a reference to the alleged influence of the left leaning Congress opposition party on the bureaucrats  The ministers  who spoke to Reuters  declined to be identified DISCONNECT WITH RULING PARTYFor some of the 5 000 or so mandarins who run the Indian government  its state owned entities  as well as administration at state government level  Modi s style of leadership has been a jolt  Many of these top officials have received a Western style education at India s elite universities or schools overseas and are uncomfortable with the ruling party s right wing Hindu nationalism and Modi s rough hewn approach to governance While getting into the Indian Administrative Service  IAS   is incredibly hard   only 1 out of about 4 500 who took the civil service exam got selected in 2018   traditionally once someone got in they had a job for life with few risks of ever getting fired  An IAS job   one of the most sought after in India   bestows huge power as well as cheap housing  a car with a driver and other perks  leave for government paid foreign study  and often the chance for plum positions in business or government consultative work after retirement  There is also a handsome pension But such conditions can also breed complacency and a lack of  can do  behavior  according to Indian politicians and civil servants  They say there are plenty of Sir Humphreys in New Delhi  referring to a character in the British TV comedy series  Yes Minister  about how top officials in Whitehall stall government policies they don t agree with  In particular  there is deep resentment in the top echelons of the Indian civil service over the interference in government by the Rashtriya Swayemsevak Sangh  RSS   the Hindu right wing umbrella group of which the BJP is a part  these officials said  RSS functionaries have had a major role in successfully lobbying for big changes at the Reserve Bank of India  for example  leading to last December s resignation of its governor and his replacement with an official who is considered more loyal to Modi  officials said  TECHNOCRATS  NOT GENERALISTSRSS figures also criticize Modi for not having enough professionally trained experts in place to implement some of his more controversial policies  The country needs a professional administration for economic development and can t depend on generalists   said Ashwani Mahajan  co convenor of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch  SJM   the economic wing of the RSS that has campaigned against some bureaucrats  Last year  Modi proposed bringing in at least ten professionals from the private sector into the civil service at the joint secretary level  but the plan has still to be implemented  and is facing strong resistance from civil servants  Joint Secretaries are two rungs below full Secretaries  the top civil servant in a ministry A senior finance ministry official said major policy decisions including demonetization  Modi s decision to wipe out high denomination bank notes without warning in 2016 and to hastily launch a goods and services tax that hit millions of small businesses and jobs  were examples of political decisions that didn t get enough airing among officials before being implemented  Both are thought to have hurt jobs growth  economists say  There is a wider concern in the civil service about India being ruled by a Hindu nationalist party that some see destroying the country s previous tolerant and secular nature But the hours are as much of a concern to some  I am looking out for other opportunities and have even requested for a transfer because it is almost impossible to work for 12 13 hours every day  even during weekends   said a senior official working with Modi since 2014   Reporting by Manoj Kumar  Rupam Jain   Editing by Martin Howell and Raju Gopalakrishnan  

CARACAS   Venezuela removed eight tonnes of gold from the central bank s vaults last week  and the cash strapped socialist state is expected to sell the bullion abroad as it seeks to raise hard currency in the face of U S  sanctions  a lawmaker and one government source said  With sanctions imposed by Washington choking off revenues from exports by state oil company PDVSA  President Nicolas Maduro s increasingly isolated administration has turned to sales of Venezuela s substantial gold reserves as one of the only sources of foreign currency The government source said the Central Bank s reserves had fallen by 30 tonnes since the start of the year before U S  President Donald Trump tightened sanctions  leaving the bank with around 100 tonnes in its vaults  worth more than  4 billion At that rate of decline  the central bank s reserves would nearly disappear by the end of the year  leaving Maduro s government struggling to pay for imports of basic goods Neither Venezuela s central bank nor its information ministry responded to requests for comment  Trump s administration has declared Venezuela part of a  troika of tyranny  in Latin America  including left leaning governments in Cuba and Nicaragua  It is seeking to cut off cash flow to Maduro s government  foster dissent in the armed forces and oust him from power in the OPEC nation The United States and 50 other Western nations have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela s legitimate president  Guaido invoked the Constitution in January to assume an interim presidency  saying Maduro s May 2018 re election vote was a sham  Maduro has branded Guaido a U S  puppet and accused him of collaborating with Washington to sabotage the economy Opposition lawmakers have blasted companies buying Venezuelan gold or holding it as collateral for loans  saying they are giving Maduro a financial lifeline during an economic and humanitarian crisis Aside from the reserves held by the Central Bank in Caracas  Guaido is attempting to freeze bank accounts and gold owned by Venezuela abroad  This includes 31 tonnes in the Bank of England worth an estimated  1 3 billion BLACKOUTS AND WATER SHORTAGESVenezuela s economy is in a sixth year of recession  suffering hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods like food and medicine  Maduro eased restrictions on foreign exchange this year  but the economy remains desperately short of hard currency needed to import goods Last week s operation took place while only high level officials were present at the central bank s offices  given that most rank and file employees stayed home due to blackouts and water shortages that have plagued Venezuela in the past month  the government source said   They moved gold out while the central bank was in contingency mode   opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado said  adding that the bars would be sold abroad  though he did not know the destination A similar quantity of gold was removed from the central bank s vaults in February  Washington in January asked foreign gold buyers to stop doing business with the Venezuelan government  This prompted Venezuela to cancel a planned sale of 29 tonnes of gold to the United Arab Emirates But in February and March the central bank continued to authorize the movement of gold  the government source said  adding that it was aiming to sell small quantities  Earlier this year  Abu Dhabi investment firm Noor Capital said it bought 3 tonnes of gold from Venezuela on Jan  21  but would not buy more until the situation in the country stabilized And in March  Ugandan authorities said they were investigating the country s biggest gold refinery over imports of an estimated 7 4 tonnes of gold   valued at around  300 million   after state run media reported it could have originated from Venezuela   Reporting by Mayela Armas  Writing by Luc Cohen  Editing by Daniel Flynn and David Gregorio  

SAN DIEGO   The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year  a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47 000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1  2017 and June 25  2018   the day before U S  District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families  The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation   for example  children under 5 The administration would provide information on separated families on a rolling basis to the American Civil Liberties Union  which sued to reunite families and criticized the proposed timeline on Saturday  We strongly oppose a plan that could take up to two years to locate these families   said Lee Gelernt  the ACLU s lead attorney   The government needs to make this a priority  Sabraw ordered last year that more than 2 700 children in government care on June 26  2018 be reunited with their families  which has largely been accomplished  Then  in January  the U S  Health and Human Services Department s internal watchdog reported that thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017  The department s inspector general said the precise number was unknown The judge ruled last month that he could hold the government accountable for families that were separated before his June order and asked the government submit a proposal for the next steps  A hearing is scheduled April 16 Sheer volume makes the job different than identifying children who were in custody at the time of the judge s June order  Jonathan White  a commander of the U S  Public Health Service and Health and Human Services  point person on family reunification  said in an affidavit White  whose work has drawn strong praise from the judge  would lead the effort to identify additional families on behalf of Health and Health and Human Services with counterparts at Customs and Border Protection and U S  Immigration and Customs and Enforcement  Dr  Barry Graubard  a statistics expert at the National Cancer Institute  developed a system to flag for early attention those most likely to have been separated The vast majority of separated children are released to relatives  but many are not parents  Of children released in the 2017 fiscal year  49 percent went to parents  41 percent to close relatives such as an aunt  uncle  grandparent or adult sibling and 10 percent to distant relatives  family friends and others The government s proposed model to flag still separated children puts a higher priority on the roughly half who were not released to a parent  Other signs of likely separation include children under 5  younger children traveling without a sibling and those who were detained in the Border Patrol s El Paso  Texas  sector  where the administration ran a trial program that involved separating nearly 300 family members from July to November 2017 Saturday marks the anniversary of the administration s  zero tolerance  policy to criminally prosecute every adult who enters the country illegally from Mexico  The administration retreated in June amid an international uproar by generally exempting adults who come with their children  The policy now applies only to single adults
