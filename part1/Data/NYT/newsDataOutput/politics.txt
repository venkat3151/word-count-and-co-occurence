RICHMOND  Va    More than a dozen state lawmakers filed onto the stage  summoned by the smiling leader of their state  Ralph S  Northam  the governor of Virginia On the governor s right were a handful of House Democrats  who as a group in February said they were  no longer confident in the governor s representation of Virginians   after learning of a shocking racist photo on Mr  Northam s medical school yearbook page On his left were mostly Republicans  including the speaker of the House  Delegate Kirk Cox  who d declared that Mr  Northam s  ability to lead and govern is permanently impaired  Some on stage were members of the legislative black caucus  which called the yearbook photo  disgusting  reprehensible  and offensive  and  a complete betrayal  Even so  as Mr  Northam took out a pen at the event last week and signed bills to overhaul the state s foster care system  the lawmakers of both parties stood behind him  grinning and clapping This is the strange  suspended state of Virginia politics  just two months after scandal after scandal seemed to be devouring the state s government from the top down In the space of a week in early February  the public was stunned by revelations about each of the three highest statewide elected officials  all Democrats  the racist photo in the governor s yearbook  accusations of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor  and the attorney general s appearance in blackface at a party in college  Protesters and news crews swarmed the Statehouse  Calls for resignations came from fellow Virginia Democrats  Republicans and even 2020 presidential candidates And then   It just went poof   said Natalie Draper  a librarian sitting in the back of a coffeehouse last week in Richmond   It s like it never happened  Virginians have various theories as to how this surreal normalcy set in Some say the whole mess was so exhausting and embarrassing that by the time the legislature adjourned on Feb  24  the outrage had burned itself out  Others point to polls that showed Virginia voters were considerably less hungry for resignations than their representatives were  Some political observers mused about more fundamental changes to the life span of scandal  describing President Trump s approach to bad press as if it were a revolutionary medical breakthrough  Don t apologize  move on  and everybody will talk about something else next week   is how Ben Tribbett  a Democratic strategist  described it   Maybe we ve been doing it wrong over the last 100 years  For the Democrats  perhaps above all  there are the blunt political realities  Whatever may happen in the 2021 election for governor  every seat in the Republican controlled Virginia General Assembly will be up this November  and Democrats have a chance to take back power in at least one chamber of the legislature  That will be hard enough now  given the bales of fodder Republicans now have for attack ads  But the idea of trying to raise money and hold rallies while spurning the three highest officeholders in the state came to be seen by many Democrats as just a needless handicap Betsy Carr  a Democratic delegate  said shortly after stepping off the stage last week with Mr  Northam that voters  want to move on    They want positive things to happen  they re concerned about the elections   she said That sort of hard pragmatism is common among Democratic figures these days  But it is not unanimous  Many younger people in the party  in particular  are frustrated by what they see as the leadership s hurry to move on from the scandals rather than come to grips with them ImageGov  Ralph Northam and his wife  Pam Northam  third from left  posing for photos after the dedication of a historical marker for the civil rights leader Dr  Dorothy Height at a library in Richmond CreditParker Michels Boyce for The New York Times Winning is important   said Taikein Cooper  the 30 year old chairman of the Prince Edward County Democratic Party   but we also have to have some morals  In the immediate wake of the scandals  the governor all but disappeared  either avoiding public events or being explicitly disinvited from them The gears of state government kept turning   bills were signed or vetoed  cabinet secretaries did their work   but Mr  Northam s public resurfacing was slow  beginning with an appearance in early March at the third annual Public Safety Unmanned Aircraft Systems Conference Still  it is only in recent days that his public schedule has approached normal   or at least  something that looks normal from the outside  I think groups are struggling with   What do we do  What do we do about inviting him  Do we want him the centerpiece of an announcement    said Mr  Cox  the House speaker  who spoke with Mr  Northam at the bill signing for the first time since February   It s going to be pretty hard to say we re just going to have a normal governorship for the next three years   Mr  Cox said Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax  too  has been showing up at public events more often  But rather than trying to change the subject from the allegations against him  he dives right into them  even unprompted  as he did on the last day of the legislative session in a surprise speech comparing himself to a victim of lynching Mark Herring  the attorney general  has taken questions from the public on a few occasions since his own blackface scandal broke  But when he talked recently with reporters in Washington  after a Supreme Court hearing on gerrymandering  no one asked him about the episode Democrats fully acknowledge that there is unfinished business in all this  But they cite the lack of resolution as a reason to slow down on those immediate calls for resignations  Most people wanted to give the governor time to sort out what had happened   said State Senator Scott A  Surovell   I think a lot of people question whether he s in that picture  and they re waiting for more information about who s actually in it  Initially  Mr  Northam apologized for appearing in the yearbook photo  which shows a man in blackface makeup standing next to someone wearing a Klan robe and hood  But since then  he has insisted that he is actually not either of the people in the picture  and he has pledged to get to the bottom of the matter  The mechanism for that appears to be an inquiry that began last month  conducted on behalf of Eastern Virginia Medical School by the law firm McGuireWoods That investigation into the role of racism in the past and present culture of the school was also examining the circumstances of the infamous photo  No findings have been announced yet  and the investigation is expected to wrap up in the next few weeks Still  Mr  Northam made another pledge around the time he announced that he was staying put  to focus for the rest of his term on addressing racial inequities in American life  a theme he now repeatedly emphasizes in speeches The governor  welcomes the opportunity for future conversations  on improving racial equity  said a spokeswoman  Ofirah Yheskel  who pointed out various measures the governor has supported in recent weeks that reflect  his focus on the equity issues  One of the chief barometers of Mr  Northam s success on this front has become the opinion of the legislative black caucus  to which other Democrats have readily deferred since the scandals broke  Members of the caucus have laid out their priorities in meetings and conversations with the governor  and they say he has mostly abided ImageAt a memorial service for Dr  Dorothy Height at a church in South Richmond  Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax spoke about Dr  Height s advocacy against lynching  false accusations and denial of due process  themes he has hit repeatedly since the scandals erupted CreditParker Michels Boyce for The New York Times He s been trying hard  from what I can see   said Delegate Lamont Bagby  the chairman of the caucus   He s stumbled on his own feet a couple times  I think he would agree to that   But Mr  Bagby gave his approval to the governor s choice of bills to veto and amendments to propose over the past few weeks  and he said he believed that long delayed but badly needed conversations about race had begun At a Baptist church in Richmond on a recent Sunday afternoon  Mr  Northam delivered brief remarks referring to lingering inequities at a ceremony in honor of Dorothy Height  a grande dame of the civil rights movement  He was followed at the pulpit by Mr  Fairfax   the first time they appeared in public together since the scandals erupted The contrast was stark Mr  Fairfax began with praise for Ms  Height s  oratory around the issue of anti lynching   but it quickly became clear he was also talking about other matters  She saw what was happening in this country  where people were being falsely accused   Mr  Fairfax said   They were not given due process  They were having their lives in so many ways impacted negatively  in some ways taken away  because people wanted not to get to the truth but ultimately wanted things changed in a negative way for nefarious reasons  It was barely subtext  and he would revisit these themes more forthrightly two nights later at a Women s History Month mixer in Hampton  Va   an event sponsored by the local chapter of the N A A C P  After the lieutenant governor gave a short speech on his fight against  fabricated claims and false allegations   the crowd erupted in cheers of support Like Mr  Northam  Mr  Fairfax has insisted on an investigation into the accusations against him  He contends that he is being accused of sexual assault and rape for encounters that were consensual His demands for an investigation are echoed by fellow Democrats  as Mr  Northam s are  But it remains unclear where exactly such an investigation is to come from  If it s proved in a court of law  something needs to be done  but we re not there yet   Ms  Carr  the lawmaker  said Prosecutors in North Carolina and Massachusetts have been in contact with the two women who accused Mr  Fairfax   Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson   but there has been no public indication yet that a criminal investigation has been formally opened  Republican lawmakers announced plans for an investigative hearing  and both accusers have said repeatedly that they are willing to testify publicly as part of a bipartisan process  but Democratic lawmakers have balked  seeing such a hearing as a fruitless exercise prone to partisan grandstanding  At this point  there are few other obvious options  We are actually engaged in initiating processes that will make the truth known   Mr  Fairfax said at the event in Hampton  speaking over the live jazz music and pleas for him to join in group photos  He declined to elaborate further On Sunday  a lawyer for Mr  Fairfax issued a news release saying that Mr  Fairfax had undergone polygraph examinations administered by a former F B I  agent  and that the results  demonstrated that Lt  Gov  Fairfax was telling the truth  in denying the allegations  A spokeswoman said these exams were separate from the  processes  that Mr  Fairfax had spoken of earlier And so life goes on in Virginia  with the legislature coming back this week for a quick session and with the political jockeying getting underway before the primaries in June  Democratic lawmakers who are asked what may come next on the scandal front have no concrete answer  most say their constituents would rather hear about roadwork  school financing and health care Those  after all  are matters that state politicians can actually change  as opposed to the things that apparently they cannot  The calls for resignation have not been rescinded   Delegate Jeff Bourne  a member of the legislative black caucus  said a few days before appearing with the governor at a bill signing ceremony   But I think it s one of those things where we are operating in the current state of affairs  And the current state of affairs is that the governor and lieutenant governor are still there   

OTTAWA   After promising an open and collaborative way of doing politics  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada on Tuesday axed from his party two prominent former female cabinet ministers who have been at the center of a festering political crisis about his handling of a criminal case Trying to divert the country s attention from the controversy  Mr  Trudeau was in a tough spot politically The two women were seen by many as symbols of his progressive feminist government  But within his Liberal Party  they were seen as untrustworthy backstabbers who kept the firestorm alive for weeks with new morsels of information feasted upon by the press and opposition parties The problems began two months ago when accusations surfaced that Mr  Trudeau and his aides inappropriately pressured Jody Wilson Raybould  the former justice minister and attorney general  to settle a criminal corruption case against SNC Lavalin  a major corporation based in Montreal  A criminal conviction would bar the company from government contracts for a decade Mr  Trudeau has denied that anything inappropriate took place  He said he proposed a civil resolution of the case  with a monetary penalty  because a loss of government contracts by SNC Lavalin would jeopardize thousands of Canadian jobs Still  the criminal prosecution has continued And since then  the standing of the Liberals has fallen in the polls  And Mr  Trudeau s image as a fresh force who practiced politics in a new and transparent way has been severely battered With their re election hopes dimming less than seven months before the national vote  several Liberal members of Parliament have openly expressed frustration with Ms  Wilson Raybould  who resigned from the cabinet on Feb  12  and with Jane Philpott  who was president of the Treasury Board  and later resigned in solidarity with her  It s become clear that Ms  Wilson Raybould and Ms  Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team   Mr  Trudeau told an emergency meeting of the Liberal members of Parliament Tuesday evening   Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided  We cannot afford to make that mistake  He added   In learning to do things and doing them differently  we ve encountered difficult moments  Ms  Wilson Raybould said on Facebook on Tuesday night that she will speak with her supporters about what to do next  I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles   values that must always transcend party   she wrote In a separate Facebook message posted Monday night  Ms  Philpott expressed dismay about not being able to make her case to the national caucus before she was exiled from it  The need has never been greater for a measured re evaluation of how the government should respond to this issue   she wrote   What I have heard from Canadians is that they want to know the truth   Jenny Kwan  a member of the New Democratic Party from British Columbia  said Mr  Trudeau s action undermined his claim of being a feminist  This is about really speaking truth to power and the government shut it down   she said But Carolyn Bennett  the minister of Indigenous Relations  tried to repair any damage  telling reporters after Mr  Trudeau spoke that the prime minister s commitment to feminism was not a sham  It s not about gender   she said  saying that her former colleagues had to go simply because they could not be trusted Until Tuesday  Mr  Trudeau had studiously avoided criticizing either of his former ministers   I ve approached this situation with patience and understanding   he said ImageThe former attorney general  Jody Wilson Raybould  appearing before the House of Commons Justice Committee in February CreditSean Kilpatrick The Canadian Press  via Associated PressBut he called last week s revelation that Ms  Wilson Raybould secretly recorded a conversation with the country s top public servant  unconscionable The two were discussing the case against SNC Lavalin  which has been charged with bribing Libyan officials during the dictatorship of Col  Muammar el Qaddafi Mr  Trudeau s government was asking Ms  Wilson Raybould to consider using a new measure  similar to ones in the United States and some European countries  that would allow the company to avoid conviction in exchange for a substantial financial penalty A criminal conviction would have barred the company from government work  which could potentially have imperiled thousands of Canadian jobs  Mr  Trudeau and his aides have repeatedly denied any impropriety Ms  Philpott also angered her Liberal colleagues by saying in a magazine interview that Ms  Wilson Raybould was being blocked by the government from revealing important information about the case While Mr  Trudeau made the decision to expel the two former members  a movement within the caucus to remove them began escalating over the weekend Wayne Easter  a former cabinet minister and veteran member of Parliament  told the Canadian Press news agency on Monday that recording the call without the knowledge of Michael Wernick  the clerk of the privy council  was  as low as you can go  He added   Jody Wilson Raybould  Should be gone  Gone  Should ve been gone long ago  While neither woman found many allies within their party  they have been celebrated by opposition members of Parliament for their actions In a statement  Andrew Scheer  the leader of the opposition Conservatives  said their expulsion showed that  if you tell the truth  there is no room for you in the Liberal Party  The Conservatives are filibustering debate on Mr  Trudeau s budget legislation in a bid to force a public inquiry into the matter Hours before she was removed from the Liberal caucus  Ms  Wilson Raybould urged her colleagues  in an unapologetic letter  to allow her to remain in the party  Now I know many of you are angry  hurt and frustrated   she wrote   And frankly so am I  I am angry  hurt and frustrated because I feel I was upholding the values that we all committed to  In her statement on Monday evening  Ms  Philpott dismissed the criticisms of several of her former colleagues  I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal  of trying to bring down the prime minister  of being politically motivated  and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson Raybould   Ms  Philpott wrote   These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods  I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister  Nor did Jody Wilson Raybould  The two former cabinet ministers will not be allowed to seek re election under the Liberal Party banner in October s election and are likely to face Liberal opponents in their electoral districts if they choose to run for re election Unless they join one of the opposition parties  they will also not have access to party financial  logistical and polling resources Both were political neophytes during the last election  in 2015  Ms  Philpott is a doctor and Ms  Wilson Raybould a lawyer who was also an Indigenous leader in British Columbia  Neither has a well developed  personal political machine Mr  Trudeau s efforts to turn political attention away from the case have so far faltered On Tuesday  he ended his announcement with a campaign style speech in which  among other things  he highlighted the government s efforts to mitigate climate change and attacked the Conservatives  plan to kill carbon taxes  

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  In recent days  President Trump has used Twitter to warn Mexico that he may close the border  to suggest that The New York Times and The Washington Post be stripped of their Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the special counsel s Russia investigation and to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates in 2018 And if Mr  Trump had his way  Brandon Neely  among others  would be blocked from seeing any of those tweets Mr  Neely  a police officer in Houston  is one of an untold number of Twitter users who have been blocked by Mr  Trump  These users  if they are logged into their accounts  cannot see the president s tweets and are unable to reply to them or see others  responses The president s actions led Mr  Neely  along with six others blocked by Mr  Trump  to sue him  saying he had violated their First Amendment rights  A federal judge in Manhattan ruled against Mr  Trump last year  finding that the president s Twitter feed was a  public forum  and  that his blockings were unconstitutional Mr  Trump appealed the ruling  and the case went before a three judge panel in Manhattan last week  The judges seemed skeptical of Mr  Trump s contention that he was acting in a personal  not official  capacity when he blocked people Circuit Judge Barrington D  Parker asked Mr  Trump s counsel  a Justice Department lawyer  why blocking  points of view the president doesn t like  isn t  just a quintessential First Amendment violation  How the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rules in the Trump case may have larger implications  as elected officials around the country expand the use of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter  Federal judges are grappling with the question of how the First Amendment may apply to those accounts Blocking on social media is not a partisan phenomenon  In 2017  for instance  ProPublica sent letters asking all 50 governors and 22 federal agencies whether they had blocked people on social media  Five Republican governors  four Democrats and four agencies responded with information about people they had blocked  Many agencies and more than half the governors did not respond In New York  the issue has arisen with Representative Peter King  a blunt and occasionally combative 14 term Republican congressman who represents parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island  Recently  one of his constituents collected the names of about 70 people who said they had been blocked from commenting on Mr  King s Facebook page  He s like this big tough guy  but he doesn t want to hear any criticism whatsoever   said the constituent  Jacqueline Hassett  who has been blocked and has met with lawyers about the possibility of suing Mr  King The seven Twitter users who sued Mr  Trump have been unblocked  following the lower court ruling   Anybody blocked by the president can still  in theory  view Mr  Trump s tweets  In an entry on its F A Q  page  Twitter tells users   If the account you ve blocked isn t logged in or is accessing Twitter content via a third party  they may be able to see your public Tweets   Other judges have issued similar rulings  Earlier this year  the Fourth Circuit  in Richmond  Va   upheld a lower court ruling that the Democratic chairwoman of the Loudoun County board of supervisors had violated the First Amendment rights of a constituent by blocking him on Facebook for about 12 hours Elsewhere  a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that three state assemblymen violated the First Amendment when they blocked a liberal advocacy group on Twitter  Jerry Brown  the former Democratic governor of California  produced records in 2017 showing that he had in the past blocked more than 1 500 people on Facebook and Twitter  and Paul Gosar  a Republican congressman of Arizona who in 2017 wrote a post on Facebook titled   So you re upset I blocked you on Facebook  Here s why I don t care  a three part series   said last year in a court filing that he was no longer blocking anyone Jameel Jaffer  the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University  which filed the Trump case and argued the Loudoun County appeal  said that social media accounts may be seen as public forums if they are used to make announcements related to government duties  engage with constituents about policy or if they use government resources   if  for example  staffers create posts  Public officials all over the country are using social media often as the main means of communicating with their constituents   Mr  Jaffer said   We want to make sure those officials aren t insulated from criticism  make sure participants in those digital spaces aren t deprived of the opportunity of hearing other citizens  divergent views and make sure these spaces retain their vitality and integrity and aren t transformed into echo chambers  In many ways  Mr  King s Facebook page reflects his public persona  It includes pictures of him in a Long Island diner with retired firefighters  a video of him at a St  Patrick s Day parade and a description of a meeting with an Israeli diplomatic official The page also includes announcements that he was backing legislation to fund the Sept  11 Victim Compensation Fund  co sponsoring a tax deduction bill and introducing a resolution calling for the extradition of people in Cuba who have been charged with crimes in the United States Mr  King said during a telephone interview that he has the right to block who he wants on his Facebook page because it does not use government resources  he also contends that it is separate from his congressional work  He said that his campaign committee pays to boost his posts  which are meant to function like re election ads  I wouldn t have to give any opponent an opportunity to comment on my campaign brochure   Mr  King said  adding that he only blocks some of his critics  usually those who make inappropriate remarks or comment frequently Mr  King has interacted with commenters  thanked supporters and sparred with critics  When a constituent from West Sayville  Chris Ann Rogers Pellegrino  asked on Facebook in 2017 for a  special outside investigation into Trump Russia ties   and told Mr  King she hoped he was loyal to  the fabric of our democracy  his reply was   My loyalty is to the Constitution  not the liberal zeitgeist  Ms  Rogers Pellegrino said she was blocked almost immediately after posting her message  Another constituent  Danielle Miller  said she was blocked last year after disagreeing with a post by Mr  King that said kneeling protests by professional football players were  rooted in the false narrative of police bias against black men  Several constituents who had been blocked said they were concerned that limiting criticism would create a misleading impression that Mr  King s positions are more reflective of his district than they actually are Christine DiBiase Martorana  from Seaford  said she was blocked after posting she was disappointed in Mr  King s  continued emphasis on Islamic terrorism  and asking for his thoughts  on non Muslim terrorists   Meg Rowe  from Brightwaters  said she was blocked after stating that she was keeping track of how many people Mr  King was blocking  It s infuriating  honestly   said Ms  Rowe  who in 2017 began a Facebook page called  Blocked by Peter King  to document blockings and the removal of posts   We just want some avenue to talk with him  even if we disagree  because it s his job to listen to us   

Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  He kissed a senator s wife on the lips  He joked about the attractiveness of several senators  teenage daughters and granddaughters  And he told a female senator to  spread her legs  because she was  going to be frisked   A  MeToo moment That s not how it was seen at the time  No  that was just Joe Biden  hamming it up as he swore in the new senators  In his time as vice president  the ceremony became an annual spectacle in Washington  with his behavior even earning an affectionate nickname   Bidening  Those jokes  hugs and kisses may look different now  An essay published Friday night by Lucy Flores  a former Nevada legislator  that accuses Mr  Biden of leaning into her  smelling her hair and kissing her head in a way that made her uncomfortable at a 2014 campaign rally  has thrust the possible presidential candidate into a major generational reckoning  A second woman came forward Monday and accused Mr  Biden of touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable  Mr  Biden entered the Senate in 1973   before abortion was legal  before the Watergate hearings  before VCRs  before the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was born  and certainly before any serious national conversation about consent Whether the 76 year old Mr  Biden can get right with his party s current mores around race and gender may be the most fraught question hanging over his presidential aspirations In the  MeToo era  we talk a lot about  open secrets   But Mr  Biden s touchy feely behavior wasn t a secret at all  It was photographed  televised and widely discussed  And  for years  it was viewed as a political asset  Mr  Biden was a skilled retail politician  according to the conventional wisdom  someone who could work a room  charm a crowd  win them over booth by booth in a New Hampshire diner This weekend s accusations could transform that strength into a weakness In response to Ms  Flores s account  Mr  Biden said he didn t believe he had ever acted inappropriately in public life but was willing to  listen respectfully  to those who may feel differently  Ms  Flores flipped the frame  saying Mr  Biden s perception didn t matter  How his actions made her feel was more important   Frankly  my point was never about his intentions  and they shouldn t be about his intentions   she said in an interview with CNN   It should be about the women on the receiving end of that behavior  Now  the political world finds itself litigating a series of thorny questions  Does intent matter  Are we allowed to think that a back of head kiss is  not as bad  as a mouth kiss  even though they are both kind of gross  Can a progressive male politician issue a denial  while still saying he believes women The debate  which should come as no surprise to Mr  Biden or his team if they ve been following the news over the past two years  will ultimately be decided by voters  should Mr  Biden jump into the race Last month  Mr  Biden referred to himself as a  tactile politician  during a speech in Dover  Del

conservative majority on the state s highest court  But it will tell us something about the political mood in a key battleground state that Democrats lost by a little more than 22 000 votes in 2016 and carried two years later While Supreme Court races are technically nonpartisan affairs  they ve become heavily politicized events  with millions of dollars pouring in from political groups  In this year s contest  conservatives back Judge Brian Hagedorn and liberals are behind Judge Lisa Neubauer The candidates faced off in a bitter debate last month that featured accusations of lying and questions of temperament A win by Judge Neubauer would leave liberals in a strong position to retake control of the court the next time a seat comes up in 2020  when Democrats typically benefit from the larger turnout of a presidential year  The court could face several big political decisions  including questions around the redistricting that will follow the 2020 census and determine the makeup

Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico  a trusted ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was seen as a possible candidate to replace her when she retired  announced on Monday that he would run for the Senate in 2020 He will seek the seat held by Senator Tom Udall  also a Democrat  who said last week that he would retire at the end of his term Mr  Luján s decision makes him the latest aspiring House speaker to move on because of Ms  Pelosi s longevity  Chris Van Hollen  now a senator from Maryland  and Xavier Becerra  now attorney general of California  are also among the former Democratic House stars who have since sought other offices An easygoing  well liked member of the House who currently serves as deputy speaker  Mr  Luján has represented New Mexico s Third Congressional District since 2008  He also led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  the party s arm that supports House candidates  in the 2016 and 2018 elections  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 election  Mr  Luján tipped his cap to Mr  Udall in a statement on Monday  calling him  a champion for New Mexico  and arguing that  New Mexico needs another champion  in the Senate He pointed to his legislative record on issues like health care and the environment  while promising to uphold what he called  New Mexico values   I was born and raised in New Mexico  on the small Nambé farm I still call home   Mr  Luján said in the statement and in a video on social media   My mother retired after 33 years with the local public school district and my late father   a union ironworker and state representative   instilled in me the importance of hard work  the idea that no job is too big or too small  and a love for New Mexico that guides me every day  In a telephone interview on Monday  Mr  Luján said that leaving the House was one of several  tough decisions  he had to make in deciding to run for the Senate  But he said he was hopeful that Democrats could flip the Senate in 2020  and  we can t do that unless we keep New Mexico blue  He enters the race at a time when New Mexico has evolved into a safely Democratic state  After voting for George W  Bush in 2004  the state has turned progressively bluer and currently has no Republicans in its congressional delegation Mr  Udall won his Senate seat in 2008 after the retirement of Senator Pete V  Domenici  the last Republican to represent New Mexico in the chamber  In that same election  Mr  Luján captured Mr  Udall s old House district  Mr  Udall is the scion of a political dynasty in the West  Democrats are likely to have an advantage in the race for Mr  Udall s Senate seat  and Mr  Luján  46  is just one of several lawmakers who could seek it  New Mexico was among the states that saw a tide of young and diverse Democrats sweep to power during last year s midterm elections  and some of those newly elected officials may now consider running The state elected a Latina chief executive  Gov  Michelle Lujan Grisham  and sent two new women to the House  Representative Deb Haaland  58  who became one of the first Native American women elected to Congress  and Representative Xochitl Torres Small  34  a former aide to Mr  Udall who carried a conservative leaning district that hugs the border  We re a small family and we have to work closely with one another   Mr  Luján said of the congressional delegation from New Mexico  But he added later   I would not have jumped into this race unless I felt I was the strongest candidate  There are also a handful of prominent Republicans in the state  including Susana Martinez  the former governor  and Richard J  Berry  the former mayor of Albuquerque  It is unclear if any would be interested in mounting a long shot campaign  and Ms  Martinez left office deeply unpopular Mr  Udall offered no hint as to a preferred heir when he announced he would retire  but he has indicated that he intends to remain involved in politics and government  

When it comes to explaining why Facebook  YouTube and Twitter have become hotbeds for extremism  propaganda and bigotry  there s a tendency to overcomplicate things  That s understandable  The algorithms that govern the platforms are unknowable trade secrets  There are  in some cases  billions of users to account for  There are meaty issues of free speech and copyright law playing out in real time across borders  Technology is confusing  And  yes  it s true that the tech companies are dealing with thorny problems that most likely have no universally satisfying outcome  Big Tech s problems are indeed dizzying and manifold  but the last few years have taught us that there s an Occam s razor quality to any explanation of the toxicity of our online platforms  The original sin  it seems  isn t all that complicated  it s the prioritization of growth   above all else and at the expense of those of us who use the services The most recent example came on Tuesday morning when Bloomberg News published a story chronicling YouTube s struggles to quash misinformation  conspiracies and incendiary content  According to the report  current and former YouTube employees said that the company had ignored warnings to change YouTube s recommendation engine and that they were  in some cases  discouraged from seeking out videos that might violate YouTube s rules to preserve a sense of plausible deniability  Employee fears  were sacrificed for engagement   Ambitious goals were set to hit one billion hours of viewing a day  and algorithms were tweaked accordingly   We were so in the weeds trying to hit our goals and drive usage of the site   one former senior manager confessed in the piece   I don t know if we really picked up our heads   As technology advances  will it continue to blur the lines between public and private  Sign up for Charlie Warzel s limited run newsletter to explore what s at stake and what you can do about it  The story shouldn t be shocking  Reports from inside YouTube echo insider tales from other large tech platforms   a familiar pattern of ruthless optimization for users and of attention gone wrong The YouTube employee s quote reminded me of a conversation I d had a few years back with a former member of Twitter s product team   Leading up to I P O   it was all about revenue growth  from C E O  on down   the employee told me  suggesting that  in a frantic race to look good for Wall Street  the company deprioritized fixing systemic issues  including its rampant harassment problem  Others inside Twitter back then agreed   I did see a lot of decisions being made in terms of growth when it came to how to handle abuse  which I get   Leslie Miley  a former engineering manager at Twitter  told me at the time Growth at any cost  It s a mantra familiar inside Facebook as well  as an internal memo surfaced last year by BuzzFeed News revealed   We connect people  Period  That s why all the work we do in growth is justified   a Facebook senior executive  Andrew Bosworth  wrote in the memo in June 2016  In a separate section  while advancing the argument that more human connections via Facebook are a  de facto good   he appears to grapple with the downsides of connection   Maybe it costs someone a life by exposing someone to bullies   maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools   he wrote Mr  Bosworth has suggested the memo was a thought experiment   I don t agree with the post today and I didn t agree with it when I wrote it   he said  But Facebook s rapid rise to two billion plus users  numerous privacy debacles and a steady stream of reported negative revelations suggest that  like its counterparts  the company s quest for expansion trumped pressing concerns of privacy and transparency  A New York Times investigation last year reported that   bent on growth   Facebook executives  ignored warning signs  that Facebook could  disrupt elections  broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe  Scale is also seductive at an engineering level  bottom line aside  Adding users and engagement  in one interpretation  might signal that you re giving people what they want  In 2017  I asked a former senior Facebook employee if staff members had felt a sense of blame for Facebook s inability to stop the spread of misinformation that plagued the platform during the 2016 election  Not exactly  the employee explained   They believe that to the extent that something flourishes or goes viral on Facebook   it s not a reflection of the company s role  but a reflection of what people want  And that deeply rational engineer s view tends to absolve them of some of the responsibility  probably  We want to hear from youOpinionLosing Your Privacy in the Digital Age  Share Your StoriesFeb  13  2019We can see this sensibility today in the way the platforms tend to obfuscate and deflect responsibility  Just last week  a YouTube executive argued that its recommendation algorithms weren t designed to nudge users toward more extreme videos  Similarly  Twitter has and will continue to argue it was not designed specifically to be disproportionately hostile to women and people of color  And Facebook will argue that it was certainly not designed to help foreign countries interfere in our elections But this defensive posture seems only concerned with intent  Even if we take the platforms at their word that they did not intend to profit from extremism or to become hubs for radicalization online  that doesn t mean it doesn t happen  Intent is far less important than the actual outcomes  And the outcomes appear to suggest that these platforms were intentionally designed to keep you glued to your screen for one more video  one more retweet  one more outraged share of a hate read  How can the mess be unwound  Can it be fixed  Those are the complicated questions  But the answer as to how we got here in the first place is much less complicated than Big Tech wants you to think  Intentionally or not  it was designed this way  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear

The House Intelligence Committee has asked one of the top contractors to President Trump s inaugural to provide it with documents about the event  a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday  opening up a new line of inquiry into the planning and financing of the ceremonies The committee asked for documents from and an interview with Stephanie Winston Wolkoff  who had been a close friend of the first lady  Melania Trump  and who had helped plan the celebrations and parties around the inaugural  the person said  The request was disclosed by a lawyer for Ms  Winston Wolkoff in a letter this week to the inaugural committee It is unclear what was requested  or why the intelligence committee is now involved  But it adds a new layer to the existing federal investigations into the inaugural committee  which was run by Thomas J  Barrack  a close friend of the president  with help from some former Trump political aides  They include Rick Gates  who previously pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  and who has been cooperating with various investigations for more than a year In February  federal prosecutors issued a subpoena to the inaugural committee demanding that it turn over documents about donors  finances and activities  The subpoena sought documents related to all of the committee s donors and guests  any benefits handed out  including tickets and photo opportunities with the president  federal disclosure filings  vendors and contracts Among other issues  federal prosecutors have been investigating whether foreigners illegally funneled donations to Mr  Trump s inaugural committee and a pro Trump super PAC in hopes of buying influence over American policy  according to people familiar with the inquiry The inquiry has been looking at whether people from Middle Eastern nations   including Qatar  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates   used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two funds  Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns  political action committees and inaugural funds A spokesman for the intelligence committee  Patrick Boland  declined to comment on the request it made for documents from Ms  Winston Wolkoff  Representative Adam Schiff  the California Democrat who is chairman of the committee  has said that the panel would investigate any  financial or other leverage  that  foreign actors  might have over Mr  Trump and his administration The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III A lawyer for Ms  Winston Wolkoff declined to comment  The Wall Street Journal reported the request from the intelligence committee on Wednesday Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have been investigating donors to and spending by the inaugural committee since last year Their investigation was prompted by a recording between Ms  Winston Wolkoff and Michael D  Cohen  the president s former personal lawyer and fixer  that the prosecutors found on Mr  Cohen s cellphone  In a separate case brought by those prosecutors  Mr  Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging hush money payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Mr  Trump Ms  Winston Wolkoff has been cooperating with that probe since last fall  earlier than inaugural officials knew  according to the letter from her lawyer A sealed court order prohibited Ms  Winston Wolkoff from disclosing the fact that she received a subpoena from the federal prosecutors in Manhattan  That order  which lasted for 180 days  recently expired  a person briefed on the letter from her lawyer said Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York  in Brooklyn  have also been looking into questions about donations to the Trump inaugural committee  They have been examining Mr  Barrack s ties to the Middle East  among other matters  according to the people briefed on the work The inaugural committee raised  107 million and spent more freely than those of previous presidents  In 72 days  it spent about  100 million  roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Presidents Barack Obama or George W  Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurations Ms  Winston Wolkoff  with a partner  set up a firm that oversaw broadcast rights for the inaugural events and worked on the documentary project featuring interviews with top inaugural committee officials  

For five days  Joseph R  Biden Jr  remained in the background as four women came forward saying they had been uncomfortable with the ways he had touched them  He put out three statements through a spokesman  but none of them was his own account or an acknowledgment of the discomfort he had caused On Wednesday  Mr  Biden decided he needed to address the matter   and his future as a possible presidential candidate   personally  Yet his approach was unusual  He released a seemingly homemade video  laying out his views on connecting with voters emotionally and even physically  and vowing to  be more mindful and respectful of people s personal space   In my career  I ve always tried to make a human connection   that s my responsibility  I think   said Mr  Biden  sitting on a sofa  his legs crossed   I shake hands  I hug people  I grab men and women by the shoulders and say   You can do this   But he added   Social norms have begun to change  they ve shifted  and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset and I get it  I get it  I hear what they re saying  The two minute video amounted to a tacit admission by Mr  Biden  76  and his aides that they needed to take more action than they had since Friday  when a former Nevada assemblywoman  Lucy Flores  published an essay in which she described Mr  Biden touching her inappropriately and kissing her on the head in 2014  On Tuesday  two more women told The New York Times that the former vice president s touches made them uncomfortable  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  And his new explanation immediately became part of a lengthening queue of remarks that have prolonged the speculation about whether he will run for president  Though he has not yet announced he would seek the 2020 Democratic nomination  Mr  Biden is widely expected to join the race soon  He began his video in a manner that suggested his entry is just a matter of time   Folks   he said   in the coming month I expect to be talking to you about a whole lot of issues  and I ll always be direct with you  Mr  Biden s aides said on Wednesday that he wanted to address the accusations about his physical contact directly after listening to the women who have criticized him  as well as many other female friends  family members and advisers  They said he was particularly affected by the comments of Speaker Nancy Pelosi  a longtime friend of his who is similarly rooted in an earlier political era  when she said Tuesday that  people s space is important to them  and what s important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it  Mr  Biden s campaign in waiting has not ruled out the possibility of a televised interview  but advisers indicated that he was more likely to address reporters when he delivers a speech to a union conference Friday in Washington  The aides spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations Wearing a blue suit jacket over a white shirt with no tie  Mr  Biden stared directly into the camera as he issued his statement  which lacked a direct apology to the women who have come forward  The hastily made video  which appeared to be filmed on a phone  was recorded at Mr  Biden s Northern Virginia home Mr  Biden tried to frame the issue around changing social norms  But some women say it is fundamentally about the invasion of personal space  and the change is that they now feel empowered to speak out  In Washington  Mr  Biden has been known throughout his political career for his tactile style of politics  with shoulder rubs  hugs and kisses that some women now say were troubling to them at the time Mr  Biden also stressed the role that personal connection had played in his political career  Over the years  knowing what I ve been through  the things that I ve faced  I found that scores  if not hundreds  of people have come up to me and reached out for solace and comfort   something  anything that may help them get through the tragedy they re going through    he said   It s just who I am  I ve never thought of politics as cold and antiseptic  Reaction to the complaints about Mr  Biden s behavior has been divided  and that carried over to his video address on Wednesday The writer Andi Zeisler  co founder of Bitch Media  cited the lack of an apology as a problem   Imagine all the time he could have saved   she wrote   by typing  I m sorry  I will do better   Alicia Garza  a prominent progressive activist  said on Twitter that she was  disappointed  with Mr  Biden s statement and called it  mealy mouthed at best   Try this   she added   I m so sorry that my actions had this impact on you  I will do the work to be better and do better  Others  across a range of the political spectrum  praised the video Several female Democratic lawmakers said they were happy to see him addressing the matter more fully  I think he needs to listen  and he s committed to doing that   said Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said   One thing I know about Joe Biden  He s a man of his word  If he says he ll do better then he ll do better   She added   And I do believe that if the women felt that he was inappropriate we have to respect how they felt about it  Amy McGrath  the Democratic former Marine fighter pilot who narrowly lost a House race in Kentucky last year  said in a tweet that Mr  Biden was  honest  humble  and cares deeply about our country  Jennifer Palmieri  a former senior aide to President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton  wrote in a tweet   In his own words and clearly heartfelt  Best thing he could do to help himself in this moment  By having Mr  Biden issue a video statement  his aides were able to get his message out directly and in more personal terms  without him sitting for a televised interview  where there would be a risk of misspeaking The former vice president is virtually certain to speak more about his behavior with women before he announces his candidacy because his staff does not want the first days of his campaign to be consumed with questions about the matter  It is unclear  however  whether he can defuse the issue if more women come forward to express their unease about previous encounters with him  I ll always believe governing   quite frankly life for that matter   is about connecting with people  That won t change   he said in the video   But I will be more mindful and respectful of people s personal space   The idea that I can t adjust to the fact that personal space is important   more important than it s ever been   is just not thinkable   I will   he said  his voice softening   I will   

On Election Day in 2016  the Republican Party was divided against itself  split over its nominee for president  Donald J  Trump In Ohio  a crucial battleground  the state party chairman had repeatedly chided Mr  Trump in public  amplifying the concerns of Gov  John Kasich  a Republican dissenter  In New Hampshire  the party chairman harbored deep  if largely private  misgivings about her party s nominee  The Republican Party of Florida was listing  hobbled by local feuds and a rift between donors loyal to Senator Marco Rubio and former Gov  Jeb Bush and those backing the man who humiliated both in the primaries Those power struggles have now been resolved in a one sided fashion  In every state important to the 2020 race  Mr  Trump and his lieutenants are in firm control of the Republican electoral machinery  and they are taking steps to extend and tighten their grip It is  in every institutional sense  Mr  Trump s party As Mr  Trump has prepared to embark on a difficult fight for re election  a small but ferocious operation within his campaign has helped install loyal allies atop the most significant state parties and urged them to speak up loudly to discourage conservative criticism of Mr  Trump  The campaign has dispatched aides to state party conclaves  Republican executive committee meetings and fund raising dinners  all with the aim of ensuring the delegates at next year s  convention in Charlotte  N C   are utterly committed to Mr  Trump  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  To Joe Gruters  who was co chairman of Mr  Trump s campaign in Florida and now leads the state party  the local Republican Party is effectively a regional arm of the president s re election effort  I ve had probably 10 conversations with the Trump team about the delegate selection process in Florida   Mr  Gruters said  adding of a potential Republican primary battle   The base of the party loves our president  and if anybody runs against him  they are going to get absolutely smashed  State and local Republican organizations typically operate below the radar of national politics  but they can be vital to the success of a presidential candidate  Party chairmen and their deputies are tasked with everything from raising money to deploying volunteers to knock on doors  and in many states they help choose delegates for the nominating convention ImageVal DiGiorgio is the chairman of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania  one of the most vulnerable states from Mr  Trump s 2016 coalition CreditHannah Yoon for The New York TimesFor Mr  Trump  who prevailed in 2016 as an outsider with little connection to his party s electoral apparatus  the ability to control the levers of Republican politics at the state level could make the difference in a close election or a contested primary  It also leaves other Republicans with precious little room to oppose Mr  Trump on his policy preferences or administrative whims   on matters from health care to the Mexican border   for fear of retribution from within the party Mr  Trump s aides have focused most intently on heading off any dissent at the Charlotte convention  To that end  two of Mr  Trump s top campaign aides  Bill Stepien and Justin Clark  have worked quietly but methodically in a series of states where control of the local party was up for grabs  They have lifted Mr  Trump s allies even in deep blue states like Massachusetts  and worked to make peace between competing pro Trump factions in more competitive states such as Colorado The devotion to Mr  Trump was on clear display Saturday outside Denver  where the state party gathered to elect a new chairman  Though Mr  Trump s unpopularity helped drive Colorado Republicans to deep losses last fall  there was no sign of unrest  Mr  Trump s name was emblazoned on lapel pins and a flag toted by one candidate for the chairmanship  and his slogan    Make America Great Again    was printed on the red hat from which the candidates drew lots to determine their speaking order Mr  Trump himself stayed out of the race  and campaign aides sent the White House a short memo last month urging the president not to pick sides between allies after Representative Ken Buck  a deeply conservative candidate  lobbied administration officials for support But when Mr  Buck claimed victory in the race for chairman  he described his mission in terms of unflinching loyalty to the president  The key is that we make sure that the voters of Colorado understand the great job the president has done   Mr  Buck said   That is what my job is  Mr  Trump faces at least a quixotic challenge in the Republican primaries from William F  Weld  a moderate former governor of Massachusetts  and other Republicans have toyed with entering the race  But advisers to Mr  Trump view it as an urgent priority to maintain Republican support  With low approval ratings among voters at large  including educated whites who once leaned Republican  Mr  Trump can ill afford additional fractures on the right ImageDevotion to President Trump was on display Saturday outside Denver  where the Colorado Republican Party met to select a new chairman for the coming presidential campaign CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesSo far  loyalty has prevailed  There is no challenge to the president   declared John Watson  a former supporter of Mr  Kasich who now leads the Georgia Republican Party   The party is in near unanimous lock step in support of him  certainly at the activist and delegate level  In some respects  the shift toward Mr  Trump in Republican state organizations has been organic  driven by the president s immense popularity with the party s most committed voters  In Arizona  an emerging presidential swing state  conservative activists in January ejected a chairman aligned with the Republican establishment in favor of Kelli Ward  a former Senate candidate with fringe views who tied herself closely to Mr  Trump But Mr  Trump and his aides have also taken a more active hand in shaping the party leadership around the country  mostly to their own great advantage  according to half a dozen Republicans briefed on the Trump campaign s loyalty operation  A division of the Trump campaign known as the Delegates and Party Organization unit has closely tracked state party leadership elections and occasionally weighed in to help a preferred contender In Michigan  for instance  Mr  Trump s campaign manager  Brad Parscale  recently endorsed a former state legislator  Laura Cox  to take over Michigan s discombobulated state party The Trump campaign has also taken steps to blunt the influence of a few Republican governors who are hostile to the president  In Massachusetts  Trump aides worked in January to help a hard line candidate  Jim Lyons  win the chairmanship against a candidate linked closely to the state s Republican governor  Charlie Baker  who is a critic of Mr  Trump   As a candidate  Mr  Lyons vowed to  make the Massachusetts Republican Party great again   In Maryland  where Gov  Larry Hogan has mused about challenging Mr  Trump  presidential loyalists in the party apparatus are prepared to flout Mr  Hogan s wishes in selecting delegates  In Maryland and some other states  convention delegates are selected by a combination of primary voters and members of the state party committee   constituencies overwhelmingly supportive of Mr  Trump  No other candidate  no matter if it s Governor Hogan  Bill Weld or anybody else  will get one single delegate out of Maryland   said David Bossie  the state s R N C  committeeman and an adviser to Mr  Trump Image The key is that we make sure that the voters of Colorado understand the great job the president has done   said Representative Ken Buck  the Colorado G O P  chairman   That is what my job is  CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesSome states are so fully in the grips of Trump enthusiasts that the campaign has sought to keep Mr  Trump neutral in local races  out of concern that he could alienate one supportive faction or another  In Rhode Island last weekend  the campaign dispatched an aide to answer questions from party activists about Mr  Trump s view of the race for state chairman  after Sean Spicer  the former White House press secretary  reportedly made calls on behalf of a candidate who was ultimately defeated  The Trump campaign made clear that Mr  Spicer had been acting on his own  a person familiar with the conversations said Last month  several top Trump strategists  including Mr  Stepien and Mr  Clark  informed the president directly on the efforts to lock down party organizations for his re election  people briefed on the meeting said  In a statement  Mr  Clark described the operation as part of a long run up to the 2020 convention  Like any good campaign operation  we are working to ensure that state party chairs and delegates reflect the will of Republican voters  who support President Trump in record numbers   Mr  Clark said   Our goal is to pave the way for a convention in Charlotte that gives the president a multiday platform to share his achievements with 300 million Americans  Though the Republican National Committee has stopped short of formally endorsing Mr  Trump  state chairmen elected with the help of Mr  Trump s campaign have defended him fiercely  even from Mr  Weld s long shot effort  When the former Massachusetts governor rolled out his campaign  Mr  Lyons blasted him harshly  as did Stephen Stepanek  a former co chairman for the Trump campaign in New Hampshire who now leads that state s Republican Party That hard edge approach has stirred some discomfort in New Hampshire  where some traditional Republicans prize the state s reputation for political independence and have resisted efforts to quash an open primary  Steve Duprey  a member of the Republican National Committee from the state  hosted Mr  Weld there in late March and argued that New Hampshire s  special role  as an early voting state required it to be open to candidates besides Mr  Trump  He said in an interview he believed primary competition was healthy  as a general matter  Our job is to be neutral and treat them all equally  period   argued Mr  Duprey  who was a close adviser to John McCain There are still elements of the Republican Party that have yet to fall fully in line behind the president  Republicans acknowledge  The party suffered serious defections in 2018 among moderate white voters who have historically tended to support Republicans  and some of the party s traditional financial backers have not yet committed to supporting him in 2020  Advisers to Mr  Trump acknowledge that mobilizing the party s major donor base remains one of the most important challenges for his campaign But there is no comparable reticence among the Republican Party s field captains in the states  At the meeting in Colorado over the weekend  Vera Ortegon  the state s R N C  committeewoman  alluded to the president s nagging Republican critics in the form of a stern warning  If you know any Never Trumpers   Ms  Ortegon said   send them to me   

WASHINGTON   The Senate on Monday blocked billions of dollars in disaster aid for states across the country as Republicans and Democrats clashed over President Trump s opposition to sending more food and infrastructure help to Puerto Rico Opposition came from both parties for different reasons  Most Republicans refused to endorse a recovery bill passed this year by the House  They cited Mr  Trump s opposition to the bill s Puerto Rico funding  as well as their own concerns that the bill lacked money for Midwestern states  like Iowa and Nebraska  that have since been devastated by flooding and tornadoes For their part  Democrats balked at a separate measure drafted by Senate Republicans that included the money for the Midwest  arguing that a proposed  600 million in nutritional assistance for Puerto Rico was not enough  The Republican legislation had no chance in the House The votes on both measures were procedural and needed support from 60 senators to advance to a full floor vote  Neither won the support required  It was unclear late Monday how lawmakers would overcome that impasse and end the delay in disbursing the disaster aid The effort begins anew on Tuesday  when Senate Democrats will propose a measure that would allocate billions of dollars that would help Iowa and Nebraska  as well as Puerto Rico  according to a Senate Democratic aide Mr  Trump has been pressuring Democrats to support a disaster relief measure that does not include the money they want for Puerto Rico  and he went on the attack late Monday on Twitter  The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any  place  in history   he tweeted Puerto Ricans  are great   he added  but  their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works  Varying forms of recovery legislation have been in limbo since December  when an initial version was tacked on to legislation that could have prevented the 35 day government shutdown  And while the House passed a relief package in January  it was ultimately left out of the compromise measure that reopened the government Some lawmakers were optimistic that a resolution could be found quickly  Democrats in both chambers have pushed for a select group of lawmakers to draft legislation that borrows from both measures  I m sure we ll start talking again   said Senator Richard C  Shelby  Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee  He compared the negotiating process to a three legged stool   You ve got the House  you ve got the Senate and the presidency   We re hopefully at a point where we can get some serious negotiations going   he said Still  senators from both parties tried to used the disaster relief votes to their political advantage Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  said that  tonight  my colleagues had the opportunity to choose action over obstruction   Shamefully   he added   Senate Democrats said no  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  said in a statement that  Congress used to set politics aside after major disasters and help victims in their time of need   partisan infighting won t rebuild a single home or school  Even Puerto Rican politicians could not agree on which of the measures to support  Gov  Ricardo A  Rosselló  a Democrat  urged lawmakers to endorse the House legislation  But Representative Jenniffer González Colón  a Republican  spoke out in favor of the Senate measure  Ms  González Colón is the island s sole representative in Congress  but she cannot vote Even before the votes on Monday  Republicans had tried to turn disaster relief into a 2020 presidential campaign issue  To my colleagues across the aisle who have been spending a lot of time in Iowa lately as presidential candidates   Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  said on the Senate floor   how are you going to look Iowans in the eye and justify a vote against moving this disaster relief bill ahead  Democrats have sought to frame Republican opposition as a slight against Puerto Rico  Nutrition assistance is not enough   Puerto Rico needs to rebuild   said Senator Patrick J  Leahy of Vermont  the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee  

PARIS   The president of Algeria resigned Tuesday night under pressure from the army following weeks of mass protests  closing out the reign of North Africa s longest serving leader but not ending a political impasse in a country where the street is demanding revolutionary change The state news agency said that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  who is ailing and paralyzed and has not spoken to his countrymen in seven years  had submitted his resignation His departure followed quickly after a statement from the chief of staff of Algeria s army  the traditional arbiter of political life in the country  calling for an  immediate  declaration from the constitutional council that Mr  Bouteflika was unfit for office Mr  Bouteflika  who was president for 20 years  had sought to prolong his rule  pushed by family members and others in Algeria s ruling elite who sought  the preservation of their narrow personal interests   the army chief of staff  Gen  Ahmed Gaid Salah  said Tuesday night The general s declaration was enough to force Mr  Bouteflika out  Only a day earlier  the president had said he would resign before the end of his term  April 28  but that was not quick enough for either the army or the protesters It was an inglorious end to a career that encompassed nearly 60 years  and some of the most treacherous politics in the Arab world  in a country that is one of the world s major oil and gas producers and is considered a bulwark against Islamist terrorism The Algerian revolution of 2019  peaceful and focused in its demand for radical change  is giving pause to authoritarian neighbors from Egypt to the Gulf to Sudan who have managed to thwart the street and had hoped that this kind of revolt was behind them Mr  Bouteflika began as the world s youngest foreign minister in the 1960s  as the henchman of one of Algeria s revolutionary leaders  and he spent long years in exile after being disgraced in a financial scandal at the end of the 1970s ImageAlgerian students taking part in a demonstration against the government in Algiers on Tuesday CreditMohamed Messara EPA  via ShutterstockHe came back to politics at the behest of the country s generals to salve the wounds of a savage civil war  becoming president in 1999 and quickly bolstering his reputation as a master maneuverer by reaching a deal with insurgent Islamists But in the end  hobbled by severe infirmity  manipulated by his immediate circle  and blinded   according to those who know him   by years in power  he pushed too far  seeking a fifth term in office That enraged a hitherto acquiescent population  which took to the streets on Feb  22 and has not left them since For now  Algerians appear to be stuck with much of the vestiges of the Bouteflika power structure  even with the president stepping down Clearly wanting to maintain control after his initial announced departure on Sunday  Mr  Bouteflika installed a new government on Sunday night  and  ominously  promised  important decisions  before he stepped down The words set off alarm bells throughout the country  Algerians  well aware of their president s reputation as a wily political operator  greeted the announcement with deep suspicion  They do not want  continuity  with any part of Mr  Bouteflika s long regime  They want a clean start Then on Tuesday night  the army  anxious to declare itself in sync with the broad based popular movement  said Mr  Bouteflika had to leave immediately What comes next is uncertain The ministers Mr  Bouteflika appointed as a parting gesture could remain in office for some months ImageThe Algerian Army chief of staff  Gen  Ahmed Gaid Salah  presiding at a military parade in Algiers last year CreditAnis Belghoul Associated PressThe protesters may want a clean break  but it is not certain that the army will go along with that  or with bypassing constitutional provisions that call for the appointment of the president of the Senate  a Bouteflika ally  as the temporary president until elections are held Algeria has known democracy only in fleeting interludes  The only election which clearly reflected popular sentiment was a vote for the Islamists in 1991  after which the army stepped in  canceled a second round and unleashed a brutal civil war that killed more than 100 000 people Yet the crowds that have clogged the streets of Algiers since Feb  22   remarkably peaceful  festive and determined   appear to believe that  if they are to have a democracy  the country must reconstruct everything afresh after decades of corrupt  authoritarian rule This is why they yell  Système dégage   or   System  get lost   The whole apparatus of the state with its phony legalism and its compromised nomenklatura  they insist  must go Like the master politician he is  Mr  Bouteflika  though barely capable of even a pained grimace  appeared to exploit the vagueness of the crowd s demands  The president   or at least those around him   spoke of  continuity  and a  transition  But the army had lost patience On Tuesday evening the standoff between General Salah and Mr  Bouteflika s circle sharpened as the general accused  certain individuals  of prolonging the crisis  An army statement quoted the general as wondering about  this handful of people  who have  amassed immense riches through illegal means   a clear jab at the businessmen around Mr  Bouteflika He called for the  immediate  application of the constitutional provisions that deem Mr  Bouteflika unfit At the end  Mr  Bouteflika was  playing a kind of liar s poker   Abdelaziz Rahabi  one of his former ministers who is now in the opposition  said in an interview Tuesday afternoon before the president resigned  The purpose  he said   to have guarantees for himself and his family  ImageIn 1963  Ahmed Ben Bella  left  then the president of Algeria  talked with Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algiers CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesIn his early days as a flamboyant  mustachioed foreign minister  Mr  Bouteflika symbolized the Third World pugnacity of the 1960s  Later  as a crafty leader  he drew a healing line underneath the shocking violence of Algeria s 1990s civil war  at the price of a willful national amnesia And always Mr  Bouteflika proved himself to be a survivor  He s had a reputation for being especially adroit and cunning  not a conviction politician  not someone who stood clearly for any principle   said Hugh Roberts  an Algeria expert at Tufts University His tenacity was a lesson learned over a very long career  In 1965 he helped his mentor  the army colonel Houari Boumediene  overthrow the revolutionary leader Ahmed Ben Bella After Mr  Boumediene s death in 1979  Mr  Bouteflika  faced charges of embezzlement and  almost went to prison   said the Algerian political sociologist Nacer Djabi Mr  Bouteflika had been accused of putting foreign ministry money in Swiss bank accounts  the journalist Mohamed Benchicou reported in his book   The Bouteflika Mystery   His reputation was blackened   said the political scientist Louisa Ait Hamadouche The lesson for Mr  Bouteflika and his circle   You ve got to stay in power  in the presidency  until the end   Mr  Djabi said  He can t reform    Mr  Djabi said    because he doesn t believe in democracy or politics  His former minister  Mr  Rahabi  said Mr  Bouteflika s obstinacy was dangerous  He s got a suicidal obsession with power   Mr  Rahabi said In throwing off Mr  Bouteflika in a so far peaceful revolution  and in forcing the army to take its side  the Algerian protesters have already scored gains beyond those achieved in many countries during the Arab spring of 2011  It s an entire population that is waking up after a long period of national hibernation   said Zoubir Arous  a sociologist  

WASHINGTON   The House voted Wednesday to condemn the Trump administration for pushing a federal appeals court to obliterate the Affordable Care Act  and it urged the Justice Department to defend the law in court The vote  240 186  was nonbinding  but it documented the House s support of the health law  which was passed nine years ago without the votes of any Republicans  With the resolution  Democrats sought to put Republicans on the record for failing to come to the defense of the health law s most popular provisions  such as protecting people with pre existing medical conditions and mandating coverage for  essential health benefits   like mental health coverage  prescription drugs  emergency services and maternity care Eight Republicans voted for it  One Democrat opposed  The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land  and it is the responsibility of the Justice Department and the administration to defend the law of the land in court   Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said   What are they doing  Just the opposite  Why  Because they don t believe in governance  That is why they are happy to shut down government  The resolution  which expresses the sentiment of the House but is not subject to approval by the Senate or by President Trump  states   The actions taken by the Trump administration seeking the invalidation of the A C A  s protections for people with pre existing conditions  and later the invalidation of the entire A C A   are an unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people  Republicans called it an empty gesture  This will do nothing for your health care   said the House Republican leader  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California   But what will it do  It will make a great press release  Representative Greg Walden  Republican of Oregon  said the resolution was a political screed and  doesn t do a darn thing to protect people with pre existing conditions   Democrats would rather play politics with health care and attack the president for political purposes  rather than work with us on what could and should be bipartisan solutions   Mr  Walden said Democrats relished the opportunity to test Republicans  commitment to health care  an issue sure to figure in 2020 elections  I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeatedly claim that they stand for protections for people with pre existing conditions and for other protections included in the Affordable Care Act   said Representative Frank Pallone Jr  of New Jersey  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee   Well  now is your chance to show it  A federal judge in Texas invalidated all of the Affordable Care Act in December  Last week the Trump administration told the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  in New Orleans  that it agreed with the judge s decision  California and other states that support the Affordable Care Act have appealed the decision If the entire law is struck down  millions of people could lose coverage provided through the expansion of Medicaid and through private insurance subsidized by the federal government ImageRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California  the House Republican leader  called the House resolution an empty gesture   This will do nothing for your health care   he said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesRepublicans have voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act  and many were reluctant this week to criticize the position taken in court by the Trump administration  But they said they would be ready to respond if the law falls to a legal challenge  If the court strikes down the Affordable Care Act  Republicans will act to protect those with pre existing conditions   said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas  the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee   We will work to make health care more affordable  guaranteeing that folks can see local doctors or go to their local hospitals  and we will preserve other important provisions  such as no lifetime limits and allowing kids to stay on their parents  plans until age 26  At the same time  Mr  Brady called the existing health law unconstitutional and called the resolution criticizing the Justice Department a  political stunt  The House Energy and Commerce Committee is working on legislation to hold down insurance costs and reverse what Democrats describe as the administration s efforts to sabotage the health law But Senate Republicans have been badly divided as they consider a response to Mr  Trump s announcement late Monday on Twitter that the party was  developing a really great HealthCare Plan  to replace the Affordable Care Act Some  averse to an election year fight on the issue  have said they would wait to see what Mr  Trump might propose  Some have praised him for raising the issue again  Back home  what we have right now is an unmitigated disaster   said Senator David Perdue  Republican of Georgia   As an elected official  it s our responsibility to bring solutions  And what President Trump is saying is that if Congress is gridlocked right now  which it is on this topic  then he wants to start a dialogue about what it is he stands for  And I applaud that  But Mr  Trump pulled back his request for a health law replacement after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  told him no such legislation would be coming before the 2020 election Opinion polls show that Democrats have a political advantage on health care  Asked why voters should trust Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act  after they failed in 2017  Senator Ron Johnson  Republican of Wisconsin  said   I would understand their skepticism  The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the health law s requirement for people to have insurance   the individual mandate   as an exercise of Congress s taxing power  Judge Reed O Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth ruled that the requirement became unconstitutional after Congress brought that tax penalty to zero in the tax cut signed by Mr  Trump in 2017  and he said that other provisions of the law could not survive because they were inextricably linked to the mandate Two Republican state attorneys general  Dave Yost of Ohio and Tim Fox of Montana  filed a legal brief this week saying there was  no basis  to strike down the whole law just because the individual mandate was unconstitutional They said the mandate could be severed from the health law without throwing out other provisions  like the protections for people with pre existing conditions  The Justice Department under Mr  Trump initially said that the mandate and the protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down  But last week  the department went further and said it agreed with the Texas judge who ruled the entire law was invalid  

WASHINGTON   House Republicans are expected as soon as Thursday to try to add an amendment on anti Semitism to a Yemen war resolution  giving Democrats a wrenching choice  Vote down the amendment amid charges that their party is coddling anti Semites  or approve it and kill a hard fought resolution aimed at ending American involvement in Saudi Arabia s war While Republicans are keeping a close hold over their plans  Democrats and Jewish groups are convinced that the minority will try the maneuver to derail the Yemen resolution and embarrass Democrats in one maneuver  In February  a similar last minute procedural motion to condemn anti Semitism caught Democrats off guard  and knocked the Yemen resolution off its fast track to President Trump s desk But this time  Democrats are prepared   and are already laying the groundwork to accuse Republicans of a cynical attempt to weaponize anti Semitism  In a closed door meeting this week  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the No  2 Democrat and a vocal supporter of Israel  implored members to oppose any Republican motion  If anybody thinks that I m not supportive of an anti Semitism resolution  you don t know much about my history  and I m going to tell that to the members on the floor   Mr  Hoyer later told reporters   This is about Yemen  This is not about some extraneous  maybe very important  but extraneous and undermining  amendment The last minute push by Democrats illustrates the lingering unease in the caucus as Republicans seek to divide them on support for Israel  And it demonstrates a renewed resolve among leadership to take a hard line against allowing members to derail major pieces of legislation by signing on to Republicans  politically freighted procedural motions Republicans have twice successfully used the tactic to divide Democrats and put them on the spot over hot button issues  once on immigration and a second time on anti Semitism  Both amounted to embarrassing setbacks for Democrats  and both emboldened Republicans  who see an opening to woo Jewish voters  a core component of the Democratic base ImageRepresentative Ro Khanna  the lead sponsor of a Yemen resolution  described the Republican maneuver as  a divisive tactic of anti Semitism to block an effort to save lives in Yemen  CreditErin Schaff for The New York Times I don t see the issue going away   said Representative Lee Zeldin of New York  one of two Jewish Republicans in the House   Silence isn t an option  Debate over anti Semitism and Israel has been roiling Democrats for months after comments by one of their freshmen  Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota  that many construed as anti Semitic  Republicans have seized on the issue  Mr  Trump has tried to brand Democrats as  anti Jewish   despite his own history of trafficking in anti Semitic tropes Republicans used the conference last week of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  the nation s largest pro Israel lobby  to attack Democrats over Israel and anti Semitism  Speaking to the group s 18 000 delegates  Vice President Mike Pence asserted that the Democratic Party  has been co opted by people who promote rank anti Semitic rhetoric  The recent controversy spurred Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and the lead sponsor of the Yemen resolution  to conduct private meetings with his Democratic colleagues to prepare for a possible Republican effort to derail the resolution  This is a bill about preventing a famine for 14 million Yemenis   Mr  Khanna said in an interview   It s about saving lives and liberty of women and children  and I find it offensive that the Republicans would use a divisive tactic of anti Semitism to block an effort to save lives in Yemen  Even as Democrats rebuke the tactic  it is not going away  Some veteran Jewish lawmakers  notably Representative Eliot L  Engel of New York  the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  and freshmen in swing districts  privately worried that it would be difficult to vote against a resolution supporting Jews or the Jewish state  according to people familiar with the discussions And at least two House Democrats  Representatives Elaine Luria of Virginia and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey  suggested they would have difficulty doing so  Ms  Luria said she would vote in accordance with her values  And Mr  Gottheimer said   This is a matter of principle for me  I have always stood strong against anti Semitism and always will  Democrats have already voted twice to condemn anti Semitism  once when the Yemen resolution first came up for a vote  and a second time as part of a broader resolution condemning all forms of bigotry after the uproar over Ms  Omar  If they had not approved the first anti Semitism amendment  the Yemen resolution would have reached Mr  Trump s desk weeks ago  Because the amendment was attached  the Senate had to start from scratch on a new Yemen resolution ImageGraffiti in Sana a  Yemen  protesting American drone airstrikes CreditYahya Arhab EPA  via ShutterstockJewish House Democrats  led by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  responded to the Republican efforts by introducing their own resolution condemning the boycott Israel movement Mr  Khanna said Democrats needed to do more  by going on offense against Republicans Last week  for instance  Representative Mo Brooks  Republican of Alabama  read from Hitler s manifesto   Mein Kampf   on the House floor to compare Democrats and the news media to Nazis who pushed political propaganda  And Representative Louie Gohmert  Republican of Texas  invoked Hitler during a Judiciary Committee hearing in which he compared socialists to Nazis in an effort to tar the Democratic left  Where are the voices calling for censure  of Mr  Brooks and Mr  Gohmert  Mr  Khanna asked on Twitter Representative Max Rose  Democrat of New York and the first Jewish lawmaker to represent his district  which has a large Yemeni population  has strongly urged his colleagues to turn back any attempts to weaponize anti Semitism to derail the legislation  The ongoing war in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has taken thousands and thousands of innocent lives  devastating families in my community back home   Mr  Rose said   I don t play politics when it comes to national security or rising anti Semitism  Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for using my faith and this issue as a political wedge  The resolution  which condemns a nearly four year conflict in Yemen that has inflicted a devastating famine  has faced a long and difficult road in getting to Mr  Trump s desk  The House easily passed it in February  But by attaching the unrelated Republican resolution over anti Semitism  Democrats stripped the bill of its so called privileged status  which would have allowed the Senate to take it up quickly and send it to Mr  Trump The Senate eventually did pass the measure  and now it is back to the House for what is essentially a do over If it passes the House cleanly  the president has promised to veto it  the second veto of his term  

ISTANBUL   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confronted the prospect of a stunning political defeat on Monday  as local voting in Turkey showed his party had lost the capital  Ankara  and possibly Istanbul  its largest city and his key base of support for many years The results of the municipal balloting on Sunday from around the country was a telling barometer of Mr  Erdogan s weakened standing with voters  as Turkey s economy has fallen into a recession and he has assumed sweeping new executive powers Mr  Erdogan was not conceding defeat on the results in Istanbul  which were still unofficial  But the head of the High Election Council said the opposition mayoral candidate  Ekrem Imamoglu  was leading the Istanbul race by 27 806 votes  with only 24 000 remaining ballots to be counted  The mathematics of the issue is over   Mr  Imamoglu told a news conference  asserting there was no way that the candidate of Mr  Erdogan s Justice and Development Party  former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim  could catch up If the Istanbul results are confirmed  the Justice and Development Party is likely to appeal to the High Election Council ImagePresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan after voting in municipal elections in Istanbul on Sunday CreditBulent Kilic Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Erdogan claimed victory over all in the elections  pointing to results that showed his party 15 points ahead of the opposition Republican People s Party in districts nationwide But for the first time in his political career  Mr  Erdogan was tasting defeat not only in mayoral races in the center of Turkish political power  Ankara  but his hometown  Istanbul  the country s business center  Please do not be heartbroken with this result   he told supporters in an address Sunday evening   We will see how they are going to administer  Rusen Cakir  a veteran commentator  said on Twitter that the turnaround was as historic as Mr  Erdogan s arrival on the political stage  when  as an Islamist and former political prisoner  he first won the mayorship of Istanbul  The election today is as historic as the local election in 1994   Mr  Cakir said   It s the announcement of a page that was opened 25 years ago and is now being closed  If Mr  Erdogan s candidate loses the Istanbul race  it would be a severe blow to his party  which after 17 years in power has been showing a decline in popularity ImageTurks casting ballots at a school in Istanbul CreditChris Mcgrath Getty Images While losing Istanbul would be a nuclear defeat for Erdogan   said Soner Cagaptay  director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy   losing Ankara  which is shorthand for political power and government  is a pretty significant loss  In a sign of how seriously he regarded these elections  Mr  Erdogan held up to eight campaign rallies a day across the country  taking center stage in the municipalities as he portrayed the vote as a matter of  national survival  and a chance to cement his administration  in perpetuity  The declining economy was at the forefront of voters  concerns  After years of impressive growth  Turkey entered a recession in March  Unemployment is over 10 percent  and up to 30 percent among young people  The Turkish lira lost 28 percent of its value in 2018 and continues to fall  and inflation has reached 20 percent in recent months Investment analysts reported that Turkey was depleting its international reserves to bolster the lira in the run up to the election  Finance Minister Berat Albayrak promised to announce a package of new financial measures after the election  but investment confidence remains weak  The campaign showed Erdogan s desperation to win   said Asli Aydintasbas  a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations   He is vulnerable because of his declining votes  While Mr  Erdogan remains by far the most popular politician in the country  his party failed to secure a majority in parliamentary elections in June and was forced into an alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party  A referendum in 2017 that gave him sweeping new authority over the legislature and the judiciary was approved by just a narrow majority of Turks ImageA photograph released by the Turkish presidential news service showed Mr  Erdogan  center  at a rally in March with political allies CreditPresidency of TurkeyEven pro government newspaper columnists warned that corruption and cronyism in the municipalities were turning voters away from the ruling party  Opinion polls showed that a larger percentage of voters than usual remained undecided right up to the election  which officials of his party took as a sign of unhappiness among the electorate Opposition candidates offered change and promised to create jobs  improve education and bolster social services  And some were blistering in their criticism of Mr  Erdogan A former deputy prime minister to Mr  Erdogan  Abdullatif Sener  said that while the economy was tanking  Mr  Erdogan was building not only a second but also a third presidential palace  and spending millions to fly around on his presidential plane Municipal elections usually draw little notice outside Turkey  But the local votes for mayors  municipal councils and neighborhood administrators was seen as critical to Mr  Erdogan s grip on power The municipalities represent the core of his working class  conservative power base and a source of income for his party  said Aykan Erdemir  a former member of Parliament and a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies  a research institute in Washington Mr  Erdogan began his career as the mayor of Istanbul  and built his popularity on providing local services like garbage collection and mass transport ImageA member of the Turkish special forces giving gifts to supporters of Mr  Erdogan in Istanbul on Sunday CreditTolga Bozoglu EPA  via ShutterstockThe president intervened personally in the race for mayor of Istanbul  pushing his longtime ally Mr  Yildirim to run when the race promised to be close  He picked another former minister to run for mayor of Ankara  the capital Mr  Erdogan also adopted a more negative tone on the campaign trail than in previous elections  He threatened lawsuits  accused the opposition of criminality or terrorism  and whipped up nationalist anger at rallies  Conjuring up a clash of civilizations  he even played edited segments of a video of the mass shooting at mosques in Christchurch  New Zealand On the economy  Mr  Erdogan told supporters that the municipalities had nothing to do with the downturn  and that he as president would handle economic matters  In the weeks before the vote  the government set up municipal stalls to sell cheap vegetables to combat rising prices Most political analysts had predicted that however dissatisfied they were  supporters of his party  known as AKP  were unlikely to make the leap to vote for the opposition alliance  But some voters in the AKP held district of Uskudar in Istanbul said they were switching  We had enough   a middle aged voter  Mustafa Topal  said after voting   We had enough of this robbery  The system of ransacking led to my change  Younger people across the political spectrum have also voiced dissatisfaction  chafing at the lack of media freedom and the dearth of job prospects  said Ms  Aydintasbas  the European Council fellow  I think this is a growing trend that you cannot suppress   she said   There is a second generation of young urban kids who are not behaving like the AKP  They have yearnings not unlike those of the kids on the other side of the tracks   They feel it is odd   she added   to have Erdogan s picture all over town like a Central Asian republic  and every time you turn on the TV he is on   

WASHINGTON   House Democrats formally punted on releasing a budget blueprint on Tuesday  instead unveiling a bill that would increase military and domestic spending caps by more than  350 billion over the next two years The proposal frustrated fiscal hawks on both sides of the aisle and Democrats on the party s left flank who balked at the prospect of increasing military spending  It also meant that House Democrats  without a blueprint to counter the one the Trump administration released last month  had effectively opted out of outlining their own budget priorities in the face of a divided government and division within their caucus Several Democratic lawmakers and aides argued that with a Republican controlled Senate and White House  it would be futile to release a budget resolution  a nonbinding document that usually serves as a statement of priorities as opposed to actual policy  There is little chance that the budget proposals put forward by the Trump administration and the Senate Budget Committee could prevail in the House  By moving this bill forward  we will bring responsible governing back to the budget process  avoid uncertainty and the unrelenting threats of a government shutdown  and meet our obligations to the American people   said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky  the chairman of the House Budget Committee and a chief sponsor of the bill But the decision highlighted the friction within the Democratic Party over how to approach spending and what to prioritize in a budget document   and contradicted the new majority s promise for regular order  House Democrats are in disarray   Representative Steve Womack  Republican of Arkansas and the ranking member on the House Budget Committee  said in a statement   Their agenda is so full of contradictions that they re unable to govern  Republicans  with a majority in both the House and the Senate  failed to pass their own budget resolution last year  which Democrats denounced at the time Even before the Democrats  endeavor was released  Republicans had criticized it as hypocritical  with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader  echoing a mantra often used by Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Show me your budget  show me your values   They have no budget   Mr  McCarthy said last week at a news conference   Does that mean they have no values  But Mr  Yarmuth and other Democratic lawmakers said the legislation introduced on Tuesday would shift the focus to a more pressing issue  the spending caps enacted in 2011 under the Budget Control Act  which would automatically cut military and domestic spending by billions of dollars without action from Congress While Congress has made bipartisan deals to raise the caps for the current fiscal year  a failure to do so for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years would cut programs by  125 billion  I think the caps bill is exactly what s needed   said Joel Friedman  the vice president for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities   The Yarmuth solution is a better use of everyone s time and energy because of the political landscape we re facing  Lawmakers have generally waived the restrictions  first struck as part of a deal between congressional Republicans and President Barack Obama  in order to accommodate spending increases  Removing the caps would also jump start the process of funding the government in 2020  which Democratic leadership has said it wants to do well before the Sept  30 deadline  The budget resolution doesn t change the Budget Control Act numbers   said Mr  Yarmuth  who has spent the past few weeks meeting with members and discussing what a budget resolution would look like   The vast majority of the caucus thinks that s the No  1 priority  Fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill called for the release of a full budget  bemoaning the partisan decline of what they said was a fundamental responsibility for both parties  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the deal  which would also allow for funding increases to carry out the 2020 census and support tax enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service  would increase spending by roughly  2 trillion over the next decade  The way we ve been running our government is irresponsible   said Representative Stephanie Murphy  Democrat of Florida and a chairwoman of the Blue Dog Coalition  a fiscally conservative group of Democrats   It may take some political courage and some responsible governing  but we have to get back to a time when we set our priorities in a budget   We should be able to pass a bipartisan budget  and there was a time when we were able to do that   she added in an interview Democrats on the party s left flank said Mr  Yarmuth s proposal allocated too much money to military spending   money they argued should be directed toward domestic programs  You cannot be opposed to Trump s foreign policy of militarism and then vote for the budgets that carry it out   Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and a vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus  said in an interview   The defense increases are totally unjustified  In a statement released late Tuesday  Mr  Khanna  a member of the Budget Committee  said he would encourage those  who are committed to a progressive agenda to join me in opposing defense funding for endless wars  It is unclear how Mr  Yarmuth s legislation will fare before a committee meeting on Wednesday afternoon Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the majority leader  said he thought that Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  would try to delay a deal on the spending caps until the end of the year to have more leverage in negotiations  It shouldn t be difficult   Mr  Hoyer told reporters  But  he added   I think that s what the administration has concluded  that they ll have more leverage at the end of the year   

Just when it seemed that democracy was all but dead in Turkey  voters delivered a sharp electoral rebuke to their authoritarian president  Recep Tayyip Erdogan Unofficial results in municipal elections over the weekend show that Mr  Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party lost control of Ankara  the capital  and Istanbul  the financial center and launching pad for Mr  Erdogan s political career Mr  Erdogan was not on the ballot  and his party still controls Parliament  but the vote was the worst election defeat of his nearly two decades in office  And while he won re election last year  a 2017 referendum that only narrowly gave him new authority over the legislature and judiciary presaged his weakening support Opposition candidates in the municipal races capitalized on growing discontent with his repression and economic mismanagement  The results signaled that  if the opposition stays united and forward looking  it could mount a true challenge to Mr  Erdogan in the next presidential election  in 2023 The president s main rival  the Republican People s Party  and its allies promised political change  job creation  better education and improved social services  Opposition members carefully monitored vote tallies and have even slept on sacks of counted ballots to ensure they are not tampered with by Erdogan loyalists Meanwhile  the pro Kurdish People s Democratic Party s disciplined effort in the bigger cities to support Republican People s Party candidates most likely provided the winning margin in Istanbul and Ankara For more than a decade  Mr  Erdogan has dominated Turkey  promoting Islamic religious values and ruthlessly crushing those he sees as adversaries  Over the years  he has manipulated the system to accrue sweeping executive powers  control the army and crack down on civil liberties  His cronies largely control the media  but Turkey still jails more journalists than any other nation The president inserted himself directly into the local election process  handpicking a longtime ally  Binali Yildirim  to run for mayor of Istanbul and choosing a former minister to run for mayor of Ankara  Their losses could deprive the president of a vast patronage apparatus that has bolstered his rule  Appearing at as many as eight political rallies a day  Mr  Erdogan waged an aggressively negative campaign  accusing the opposition of criminality or terrorism  threatening lawsuits and fueling nationalist anger It s not surprising that voters saw the election as a referendum on Mr  Erdogan s rule  Turkey s economy fell into recession in March after years of enviable growth  The unemployment rate is now over 10 percent  and is as much as 30 percent among young people  In 2018  the value of the Turkish lira fell 28 percent  Inflation is at 20 percent  Voters  particularly the young  are also concerned about corruption among members of the Erdogan family and its allies  Mr  Erdogan s party is challenging the vote counts but said it would respect the results  despite his autocratic bent  Mr  Erdogan values the legitimacy that elections confer The United States and other Western democracies had been losing hope that Turkey can be a reliable ally given Mr  Erdogan s drift away from democratic values and NATO and toward Russia  The latest election results offer a chance to assure him that any tampering would widen that breach   and further endanger economic and military partnerships  One concern is that Mr  Erdogan could try to increase his flagging support by undertaking long threatened military operations against America s Kurdish allies in Syria  Such a move may backfire  particularly if the operations go poorly Especially now that Turkey s political opposition has shown it is alive and capable of pushing back  Opinion   Selim KoruHas Erdogan s Populism Reached Its Limits April 2  2019Erdogan  Turkey s Leader  Staring at Major Electoral DefeatMarch 31  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram

pension crisis  and fast  This is all hard   said David Axelrod  a longtime Chicagoan and political strategist   She s just pulled off an extraordinary political feat and that bespeaks a certain intellect and strength that is important  There are other skills that will be needed now   to cajole people  to get people to accept compromise  to recognize how much of the loaf you can have   he

political fighting that came to be known as Council Wars ImageHarold Washington  right  and his fiancée  Mary Smith  joined hands with State Senator Richard Newhouse as Mr  Washington declared victory in the 1983 mayoral race CreditKen Love Associated PressWhile Ms  Lightfoot is unlikely to encounter that level of organized resistance from the 50 member City Council  she will have to contend with it as a formidable governing body  theoretically powerful  thick with alliances and at least partly stocked with aldermen who supported Ms  Lightfoot s opponent in the mayoral race  Toni Preckwinkle  Historically  mayors like Ms  Lightfoot s predecessor  Rahm Emanuel  have held a firm hand over the council in setting the city s agenda  but Ms  Lightfoot s relationship with the aldermen is uncertain for now  None of them owe their elections to Lori  and so for the first time in perhaps 55 years  you may see the emergence of the kind of Chicago city government that during that time has only existed on paper   a weak mayor strong City Council government   said Marilyn Katz  a political consultant who worked on the Harold Washington campaign   What she uses to get them to vote for her proposals is unclear  David Orr  a former county clerk who served briefly as an interim Chicago mayor in the 1980s  said he thought Ms  Lightfoot s overwhelming margin of victory   she won all 50 of the city s wards   would ease her efforts to make inroads with the City Council  It s going to be a battle  O K    a battle in the sense that power never wants to give up what it s got   Mr  Orr said Ja Mal Green  an activist and former mayoral candidate who supported Ms  Lightfoot  said he believed that voters understood that Ms  Lightfoot could not instantly make all the changes she has pledged  She s not going to be able to make good on every promise   Mr  Green said   She ll be able to start the path for all the things that she promised  The City Council is not the only possible roadblock between Ms  Lightfoot and her ambitious agenda  Ms  Lightfoot  who promised in her campaign to kill what s left of the sputtering  Chicago machine   a system of patronage and corruption that once dominated city politics  will also face the challenge of working with Ms  Preckwinkle  who remains the president of the Cook County Board and will work in an office near Ms  Lightfoot Ms  Preckwinkle

Promises of ReformAnother challenge ahead for Ms  Lightfoot  the scandal prone police department and persistently high homicide rate  both of which damaged the city s reputation and vexed Mr  Emanuel through eight years in office She will quickly be tested  After running on promises to reduce gun violence  Ms  Lightfoot will take office just before summer  the season when shootings traditionally spike  No child should have to worry about the consequences of going to the park and no parent should have to keep their kids inside on a warm day for fear of violence   Ms  Lightfoot s campaign website said Generations of Chicago mayors have struggled to tamp down violence and root out police misconduct  sometimes making progress but never ending the problems  Ms  Lightfoot  who made the issues central to her campaign  will have to decide whether to pursue her promised changes with new leadership in the Police Department or keep Superintendent Eddie Johnson in his post Ms  Lightfoot s role with law enforcement is complex  She emerged in recent years as one of the chief critics of the police  and she led a panel that found patterns of excessive force  systemic racism and strained community relations in the department  But she has a background in law enforcement  including a stint as a federal prosecutor  and has worked in police oversight roles in Chicago  including as the president of the Chicago Police Board Vague Plan for a Financial MessPerhaps most of all  Ms  Lightfoot will be tested by the city s urgent fiscal woes All four of the pension funds are miserably underfunded  Ms  Lightfoot also must dream up a plan to solve an expected budget shortfall in the coming year  That all comes as Chicagoans are increasingly frustrated over mounting taxes and increased fees   and loath to even talk about digging up any more cash for City Hall  And the possibility of worse economic times could make matters even more dire  The city and state of Illinois descended into their worst in the nation financial condition during one of the longest economic expansions in U S  history   Laurence Msall  president of the Civic Federation  a watchdog group  said   Neither government is currently prepared to weather the storm in the event of a recession  particularly if it is deep or long lasting  The fiscal challenges have developed over decades and multiple mayors  and they loom  During a combative campaign  neither Ms  Lightfoot nor her opponent laid out a comprehensive plan to solve the problem  The hard part starts now   said Eric Adelstein  a political consultant in Chicago who helped with Ms  Lightfoot s campaign   There are huge challenges facing this city  It s an exciting moment  but these jobs are rough   

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is preparing an economic relief package for Venezuela that would put United States dollars directly into the hands of Venezuelans in the event that the government of President Nicolás Maduro falls Larry Kudlow  the director of the White House s National Economic Council  disclosed the outlines of the plan on Wednesday as he called on Mr  Maduro to step aside and allow Juan Guaidó  the opposition leader whom the United States recognizes as Venezuela s interim president  to take office Plans for a comprehensive aid package for Venezuela come as President Trump is cutting aid to other countries  including Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  out of frustration over the way those nations have handled their migration policies  Mr  Trump has also threatened to cut funding to Puerto Rico  a United States territory  over its handling of federal hurricane relief funds  We have a lot of plans to revitalize the Venezuelan economy and to move very rapidly   Mr  Kudlow said at an event sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor   It would be a rescue plan  It would be a restructuring plan  Venezuela has been crippled for years by hyperinflation and a failing economy that has led millions to flee for Colombia and other countries  The nation has been further disrupted since January  when opposition political leaders refused to acknowledge as legitimate the re election of Mr  Maduro  The United States has thrown its support behind Mr  Guaidó  who declared himself interim president that month The administration is coordinating with regional banks in South America and the International Monetary Fund on a plan to stabilize Venezuela s teetering economy  Mr  Kudlow said  The Treasury Department  the National Economic Council and the National Security Council  he said  intend to use technology such as smartphones and apps to get American dollars to Venezuelans  There s many clever ways to get cash in there   Mr  Kudlow said   And the cash will not be bolívars  it will be dollars  The White House did not offer a timetable for the economic package or details about its scale  In recent months  the administration has imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela as part of a pressure campaign to topple the Maduro government  which has been receiving support from Moscow In March  Mr  Trump warned that Russia must  get out  of Venezuela after two Russian airplanes that were transporting military personnel arrived in Caracas  the capital of Venezuela  Russia has offered to send the Maduro government shipments of food and medicine as it struggles to confront soaring prices and widespread blackouts Mr  Kudlow said on Wednesday that more sanctions could be coming as the Trump administration seeks to ratchet up pressure on Mr  Maduro Venezuelans have been bearing the brunt of the political and economic turmoil in the country  Last month  the Red Cross received permission from Venezuela s government and its opposition leaders to roll out a global relief campaign that could help ease the humanitarian crisis Republicans and Democrats in Congress have expressed support for efforts to help revive Venezuela s economy  Senator Robert Menendez  Democrat of New Jersey  and Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  on Wednesday unveiled the Venezuela Emergency Relief  Democracy Assistance and Development Act  or the Verdad Act  to help bolster support for Mr  Guaidó The legislation would provide  200 million in aid for Venezuela and  200 million for neighboring countries to absorb refugees  It would also bolster sanctions against the Maduro government  We need to expand humanitarian assistance  address kleptocracy   formally support  Mr  Guaidó s efforts to restore democracy  Mr  Menendez wrote on Twitter  

WASHINGTON   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  using a little known provision in the federal tax code  formally requested on Wednesday that the I R S  hand over six years of President Trump s personal and business tax returns  starting what is likely to be a momentous fight with his administration Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  hand delivered a two page letter laying out the request to Charles P  Rettig  the Internal Revenue Service commissioner  ending months of speculation about when he would do so and almost certainly prompting a legal challenge from the Trump administration Responding to questions from reporters in the Oval Office  Mr  Trump suggested that he would fight the request because  he said  he was being audited  I guess when you have a name  you are audited  but until such time as I m not under audit I would not be inclined to do that   he said  Read Mr  Neal s letter to the I R S  commissioner  The move by Mr  Neal came as other panels controlled by House Democrats were flexing their muscles  The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning authorized its chairman to use a subpoena to try to force the Justice Department to give Congress a full copy of the special counsel s report and all of the underlying evidence used to reach his conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 election And the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee said that he would soon ask for a vote on a subpoena of his own to compel Mazars USA  an accounting firm tied to the president  to produce a decade s worth of Mr  Trump s financial records  They have told us that they will provide the information pretty much when they have a subpoena   the chairman  Representative Elijah E  Cummings of Maryland  told reporters   And we ll get them a subpoena  Unlike the chairmen of other committees  Mr  Neal is not relying on a subpoena or standard congressional processes  Instead  he is invoking an authority enshrined in the tax code granted only to the tax writing committees in Congress that gives the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee the power to request tax information on any filer Mr  Neal gave the agency until April 10 to comply with the request  and if he receives the information  he will then confidentially review it with his committee staff The provision  which dates in some form to the Teapot Dome scandal of Warren G  Harding s administration  at least on its face gives the Trump administration little room to decline a request like Mr  Neal s  It only says that the Treasury secretary  shall  furnish the information  President Trump is the first president in nearly a half century to break precedent and refuse to voluntarily release his tax returns   said Representative Dan Kildee  Democrat of Michigan and a member of the Ways and Means Committee   The president is the only person who can sign bills into law  and the public deserves to know whether the president s personal financial interests affect his public decision making  The Treasury Department and the I R S  did not immediately respond to requests for comment But Democrats anticipate that the Trump administration will object to the request and force the matter into the courts  where its adjudication could take months or longer  Though the provision   No  6103 in the tax code   is invoked frequently by the committee  there is little precedent for using it to view the returns of a president who has not invited the scrutiny Republicans have vigorously argued against the request  saying that whatever justification Democrats produce will belie their true intent  to fish for information that could embarrass the president politically VideoThe House Judiciary Committee approved the authorization of a subpoena for a full copy of the Mueller report  The chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  said he would not issue this subpoena right away CreditCreditT J  Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesRepresentative Kevin Brady of Texas  the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee  called the request  an abuse of the tax writing committees  statutory authority   Weaponizing our nation s tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans  privacy rights   Mr  Brady said in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin   As you know  by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns  Defying modern presidential norms  Mr  Trump has refused since he became a candidate for president to release any of his tax returns  Democrats suspect the tax information could provide clues to wrongdoing by Mr  Trump  and they made getting the documents one of their top oversight priorities when they reclaimed control of the House in January  A New York Times investigation showed that the president engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father  Mr  Neal said he was making the request as part of his committee s oversight of  the extent to which the I R S  audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president   Under I R S  policy  the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year  Mr  Neal said the committee was considering legislation related to the issue  I take the authority to make this request very seriously  and I approach it with the utmost care and respect   Mr  Neal said in a statement   This request is about policy  not politics  my preparations were made on my own track and timeline  entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration  He added   I trust that in this spirit  the I R S  will comply with federal law and furnish me with the requested documents in a timely manner  In addition to Mr  Trump s personal returns for 2013 to 2018  Mr  Neal requested returns for Mr  Trump s trust and seven other core Trump business entities that control scores of other Trump operations  including his golf club in Bedminster  N J  He also asked the I R S  to share any information it had related to the entities  including whether they had been audited Liberal Democrats have complained for weeks that Mr  Neal  70 and a roll up your sleeves legislator  was dragging his feet on making the request  They have organized events in his district  taken out advertisements and produced legal briefs meant to make a case that he should act and act quickly Mr  Neal said throughout that he was chiefly concerned with crafting a request  alongside the House general counsel and the Ways and Means Committee staff  that could withstand legal challenge  I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative  legal and oversight rights   he said on Wednesday In the Judiciary Committee  the chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  said he would not immediately issue the subpoena for the Mueller report  But the party line vote won by Democrats who control the committee ratchets up pressure on Attorney General William P  Barr as he decides how much of the nearly 400 page report to share with lawmakers  I will give him time to change his mind   Mr  Nadler said in his opening statement   But if we cannot reach an accommodation  then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials  The committee also approved subpoenas for five former White House aides who Democrats said were relevant to an investigation into possible obstruction of justice  abuse of power and corruption within the Trump administration They included Donald F  McGahn II  a former White House counsel  Stephen K  Bannon  the president s former chief strategist  Hope Hicks  a former White House communications director  Reince Priebus  the president s first chief of staff  and Annie Donaldson  a deputy of Mr  McGahn

CHICAGO   Former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot easily won the Chicago mayor s race Tuesday  earning support from every part of the city to defeat a longtime political insider and become the first black woman and openly gay person to lead the nation s third largest city Lightfoot  who had never been elected to public office  delivered a commanding victory over Toni Preckwinkle  who served in the City Council for 19 years before becoming Cook County Board president  Preckwinkle also is chairwoman of the county Democratic Party Lightfoot promised to rid City Hall of corruption and help low income and working class people she said had been  left behind and ignored  by Chicago s political ruling class  It was a message that resonated with voters weary of political scandal and insider deals  and who said the city s leaders for too long have invested in downtown at the expense of neighborhoods  Together we can and will make Chicago a place where your zip code doesn t determine your destiny   Lightfoot told a cheering crowd at her victory party   We can and we will break this city s endless cycle of corruption and never again   never ever   allow politicians to profit from elected positions  She said people are seeing  a city reborn    a place where race and  who you love  don t matter Chicago will become the largest U S  city to have a black woman serve as mayor when Lightfoot is sworn in May 20  She will join seven other black women currently serving as mayors in major U S  cities  including Atlanta and New Orleans  and will be the second woman to lead Chicago Preckwinkle said she called Lightfoot Tuesday night to congratulate her on a  hard fought campaign   While I may be disappointed I m not disheartened  For one thing  this is clearly a historic night   she told a crowd gathered in her South Side neighborhood   Not long ago two African American women vying for this position would have been unthinkable  And while it may be true that we took two very different paths to get here  tonight is about the path forward  Congratulations poured in for Lightfoot  56  who has one daughter with her wife  Amy Eshleman Brian Johnson  CEO of Equality Illinois  said the civil rights organization for lesbian and gay people was  thrilled  with the outcome  This victory is historic  and it is also an undeniably proud moment for the LGBTQ community   Johnson said Pete Buttigieg  the openly gay mayor of South Bend  Indiana  who s running for president in 2020  said on Twitter that Lightfoot  will be a terrific new leader for her city and in the community of American mayors  Lightfoot emerged as the surprising leader in the first round of voting in February when 14 candidates were on the ballot to succeed Mayor Rahm Emanuel  who decided against running for a third term Lightfoot seized on outrage over a white police officer s fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald to launch her reformer campaign  She got in the race even before Emanuel announced he wouldn t seek re election amid criticism for initially resisting calls to release video of the shooting  I m not a person who decided I would climb the ladder of a corrupt political party

WASHINGTON   President Trump backed off plans to introduce a Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act after Senator Mitch McConnell privately warned him that the Senate would not revisit health care in a comprehensive way before the November 2020 elections Reversing himself in the face of Republican consternation  Mr  Trump said his party would not produce a health care plan of its own  as he had promised  until after the elections  meaning he will only try to fulfill his first term promise to repeal and replace his predecessor s signature program if he wins a second term The president s abrupt about face  announced on Twitter on Monday night after talking with Mr  McConnell  all but ensured that health care will take a central place in next year s campaign  elevating an issue Democrats consider one of their strengths  But it may take the legislative heat off Republicans exasperated by Mr  Trump s unexpected push to devise a wholesale replacement for President Barack Obama s health law in the coming months  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   Mr  McConnell  the majority leader from Kentucky  said on Tuesday   He did say  as he later tweeted  that he accepted that and that he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign  ImageListen to  The Daily   Trump Wanted to Scrap

over health care shows a sea change in the Republican stance heading into 2020 michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  President Trump has backed away from his call to replace the Affordable Care Act with a Republican alternative  Alex Burns on why the president s own party talked him out of it  It s Wednesday  April 3 alexander burnsSo last week was as close to a moment of total happiness as President Trump has had in a long time  music archived recording 1President Trump s legal team as well as many of those who are close to the president are saying they feel the Mueller report fully vindicates the president after nearly  archived recording 2There s no way to take this letter other than a huge win for the president archived recording 3To say White House officials are happily telling the American people I told you so  well  that would frankly be a bit of an understatement archived recording  donald trump And after three years of lies and smears and slander  the Russia hoax is finally dead  The collusion delusion is over alexander burnsThat s what makes it all the more surprising that his administration decided to dive right back into one of the most politically damaging fights of his whole presidency  which is health care archived recording 1The Trump Justice Department just announced a major reversal on Obamacare archived recording 2Today  he called the Affordable Care Act horrible and is mounting a push to kill it off archived recording 3Fresh off his Mueller investigation victory  some of his biggest supporters are questioning the timing archived recording 4Here you have a huge messaging win for the president and the White House with this Mueller summary  Why now  Why do this archived recording 5Why now  maybe even why at all michael barbaroAnd how does he dive back into that politically damaging fight alexander burnsHe directs the Justice Department to take sides in a lawsuit that has been making its way through the federal courts  It was brought by Republican legal officials in a number of states  It has been ruled on by one judge in Texas that the Affordable Care Act is invalid archived recordingA federal judge in Texas has just struck down Obamacare  True story  Judge Reed O Connor says the individual mandate  the part of the law that requires you to participate  is unconstitutional  And because it cannot be separated from the rest of the law  which it cannot be  the entire law is invalid alexander burnsIt is seen as a really long shot challenge to the Affordable Care Act  something that  in all likelihood  will probably not result in the law being struck down as a whole  but the White House was going to have to decide at some point whether they were going to defend the A C A  at the highest levels of the legal system or whether they were going to take sides against a law that s on the books that Congress failed to repeal when it had the chance  And that s what they did archived recording  donald trump We think it will be upheld  and we think it will do very well in the Supreme Court  And if the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out  we will have a plan that s far better than Obamacare michael barbaroAnd my sense is that under normal circumstances  the White House almost reflexively defends laws put on the books by Congress alexander burnsIt s a pretty extraordinary step for the president to take sides  not just against a law that s already on the books  but really the biggest piece of social legislation that s been passed in recent history  And he does it at the urging of some of his most conservative advisers in the White House  including the chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  archived recording  mick mulvaney And it s hard to know where to begin when you re talking about how bad the current health care legislation is for small business alexander burns  who  before he was a member of the Trump administration  was a hardliner in the House of Representatives waging war on the Affordable Care Act from Capitol Hill archived recording  mick mulvaney It s almost as if the folks who wrote this piece of legislation last year either have no idea how small business works or they don t care how small business works  Either way  the current health care legislation is a complete disaster for small business  and  alexander burnsThe argument that Mulvaney and others make is that if the president is going to run for re election as a guy who made promises and kept his promises  especially to conservative voters who still care a lot about getting rid of Obamacare  he has got to take every chance he has to go against it michael barbaroAnd given the dynamics of Congress  this is perhaps his best chance alexander burnsMaybe his only chance  because Democrats now control the House  There is really no shot for Republicans to pass a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act  So if they re going to take it down  they re going to take it down in the courts michael barbaroO K   well  what is the response to this announcement alexander burnsWell  Democrats are totally elated archived recording  nancy pelosi This is actually an opportunity for us to speak to the American people with clarity archived recording  chuck schumer It s a stark reminder of the difference between our two parties  Democrats are fighting to expand and improve health care coverage and lower costs while Republicans are trying to take it all away and raise costs alexander burnsThey have spent  at this point  several days on the defensive about some of the claims that they made about what was likely to be in Robert Mueller s report  They are desperate to get away from their own divisive fights about the nature of liberal health care policy  You have had  in the presidential primaries  in the House of Representatives  even in the Senate where Democrats aren t in control  just endless tugs of war between moderate liberals  very liberal Democrats  far left Democrats over what kind of health care system the country ought to have in an ideal world  Should it be European style single payer health care  Should it be a system that just totally does away with private health insurance  All these kinds of divisive debates on the left that have had Democrats tripping over each other  But President Trump weighs in the way he does on the Affordable Care Act  and all of a sudden all those conflicts hit pause archived recording  nancy pelosi Oh  no  please archived recording SINGING  Happy birthday to you alexander burnsAnd the timing on the Democratic side is sort of comical in that it is literally Nancy Pelosi s 79th birthday  archived recordingHappy birthday to you alexander burns  the morning after this Justice Department announcement comes out  And when you have Democrats singing  Happy Birthday  to her  there was this sense in the caucus that she had gotten the best gift a president could have given her michael barbaroWhat is the reaction from Republicans in Congress alexander burnsWell  real dismay and surprise and sort of horror archived recordingEven Republicans appear bewildered by President Trump s promise to make the G O P  the party of health care alexander burnsAnd not just from the few remaining relatively moderate Republicans archived recordingSome Republicans are nervous about that  including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy  According to Axios  McCarthy called the president and told him the decision made no sense  saying the health care battle helped Democrats win the House and several state capitals last year alexander burnsEvery Republican analysis of the midterm elections concluded that they lost the House because of health care more than any other individual policy issue  So if you are Kevin McCarthy  the new House minority leader  you are just appalled at the idea that your members are now going to have to have this fight all over again michael barbaroRight  We had talked about this with you during the midterms   that there had been this huge public shift on Obamacare and that voters who might have previously been against it now do not want it taken away alexander burnsThat s right  It was less of a thank you to Democrats than a punishment for Republicans  that Democrats never got the political boost back in 2010  2012  2014 that they hoped they would get for passing a big new social benefit  But what they did ultimately get was the benefit of voters turning against Republicans who wanted to take those benefits away  So Obamacare as a term  as a law  still kind of a mixed bag politically  but there are elements in that law  like protections for people with pre existing medical conditions  that are enormously popular  And Republicans look back on the last campaign  the one that ended really rather badly for them  and see that as  more than anything else  the fatal political mistake they made michael barbaroSo why would President Trump  the leader of the Republican Party  who had to have watched that same midterm that you re describing  why would he do this if the takeaway of that midterm is that the Affordable Care Act is no longer toxic and might even be liked by a wide cross section of Americans alexander burnsIn the president s public statements  and as far as we can tell based on his personal thinking  he recognizes that health care is a huge political vulnerability for Republicans  that the last thing they did on health care  that big repeal drive  was politically devastating to them  And his proclamation that they need to become the party of health care clearly reflects an understanding that a problem needs to be fixed archived recording  donald trump So we re going to get rid of Obamacare  And I said it the other day  The Republican Party will become the party of great health care  It s good  It s important michael barbaroI guess I can see President Trump s argument there  It feels kind of legitimate  Wouldn t it be smart for Republicans heading into the next presidential election  2020  to recognize that there are things that voters like about the Affordable Care Act  But in order for it to be a benefit for the Republicans and not the Democrats  they need to convince voters that the Democratic plan is a bad one and that Republicans will give them a better one alexander burnsRight  But giving voters a better version of health care provided by the Republican Party has always had to mean more than just getting rid of the system that currently exists  It s this strange kind of bifurcated mental space that Republicans have been living in politically  where they want to run against Democrats for trying to blow up the health care system and replace it with single payer  and  on the other side  they want to get rid of much of the existing health care system and replace it with something to be named later michael barbaroIn other words  they don t really have a plan to replace it alexander burnsThey don t  and they kind of never have  not a consensus plan that s supported by a broad cross section of the party and voters  And that s why when the president came out with this position through the Justice Department and then suggested that Republicans in Congress ought to come up with something great  the backlash from Republicans at the highest levels of the congressional party was swift and severe  The view among congressional Republicans was that this was just sort of a total fantasy coming from the president  The idea that they would not only come up with a plan and come up with a plan that would be popular and meet the standards that the president has laid out in rally after rally  but that they would do it within a year and then run on it in 2020 just seemed like it was cut from whole cloth michael barbaroIs there also a feeling among Republicans toward the president along the lines of  dude  we just want to stop calling attention to this issue  It s a losing issue for us  Stop drawing attention to it alexander burnsOh  absolutely  And if the concern among folks like Mick Mulvaney is that walking away from the fight looks like surrender  the view from a lot of Republicans on the Hill is they ve already lost  They can talk about how they lost  or they can talk about other stuff  and the president is choosing to talk about defeat michael barbaroRight  Instead of talking about what I had imagined Republicans would be talking about for the next couple of months and maybe even the next year  which is the Democratic fight over  Medicare for all   the Democratic fight over whether private insurance should even exist   I had expected that that would be the consuming discussion in the political world and in the political campaigns to come when it came to health care alexander burnsSo did I  and I think so did a lot of Republican candidates down the ballot preparing for 2020  There was always going to be tension in the Republican message about Democratic radicalism on health care  because if you are running in 2020 on the idea that Democrats are going to blow up the current system and replace it with European style medicine  you re kind of implicitly defending the status quo system as it exists under Obamacare  It s an extraordinarily awkward position for Republicans to be in  Can you be opposed to Democratic proposals to make the health care system even more liberal  even more regulated or structured by the government  without essentially defending the system that Barack Obama put in place  We don t know how they re going to walk that line  We don t know to what extent they ll even try  But the president s current approach  which is to say that Democrats will do something drastic and bad to your health care  and I m not quite going to tell you what I m going to do yet  doesn t seem sustainable michael barbaroSo what happens in the last 24 hours or so to this Trump led project to try to strike down  repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act alexander burnsWell  after days of other Republicans expressing public discomfort with where the president was headed  archived recording  mitch mcconnell So I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate alexander burns  Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader  conveyed in no uncertain terms to the White House that this was a non starter in the Senate  that the president was free to do what he wanted to do on health care  but that Senate Republicans were not going to be taking the lead on this  It was not a fight they wanted  period  full stop archived recording  mitch mcconnell So we don t have a misunderstanding about that  We will not be doing comprehensive in the Senate alexander burnsThe president seemed to have gotten the message archived recordingPresident Trump on the retreat archived recording  donald trump No  I wanted to delay it myself  I want to put it after the election alexander burnsAnd his response was to go onto Twitter and to declare that they are totally going to do all the things that he said they were going to do  but at a much later date  after the 2020 election michael barbaroRight  He cited the date 2021  We will do all this right after the election alexander burnsRight after an election when  in his construction  he would be re elected  Republicans would hold the Senate  and they would take back control of the House  So that s not just a delay of game  That is setting a whole bunch of other conditions on what would need to happen to get there michael barbaroWere you surprised  Alex  that the president backed down on this so quickly alexander burnsI was surprised by how fast it happened  I wasn t surprised that he sort of came up with a really big theory of what should happen next and then eventually let it disintegrate  because we ve seen that pattern a number of times  But to pick a fight this big and to stick with it for so little time is the definition of politically counterproductive michael barbaroSo now  we are basically back where we started  The Affordable Care Act is likely to remain the law of the land  So what did we learn from this weeklong ordeal alexander burnsWell  the biggest thing we learned is that the politics of health care have been turned on their head in the last couple of years  and that the Affordable Care Act is no longer a liability for Democrats  and that Republicans  whether they want to acknowledge it or not  have largely abandoned the fight  music  The fact that you had the senior most members of the congressional party saying so clearly to a president they helped elect and have loyally supported  we don t want to touch health care   it would have been sort of unimaginable to someone five years ago that that would happen with a Republican president in office michael barbaroAlex  thank you very much alexander burnsThank you  music alexander burnsTomorrow s my birthday  so this is like a little birthday special michael barbaroYay  Is that on the mic lisa tobinHappy birthday tomorrow michael barbaroWe ll be right back   MUSIC   Here s what else you need to know today archived recording  theresa may Despite the best efforts of M P s  the process that the House of Commons has tried to lead has not come up with an answer  So today  I m taking action to break the logjam michael barbaroIn her latest attempt to rally support for Brexit after a series of embarrassing setbacks  British prime minister Theresa May said she would seek a new delay for leaving the European Union and would begin negotiating a Brexit plan with her political rivals in the Labour Party archived recording  theresa may I m offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan that we would both stick to to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal michael barbaroThe attempt to work across the aisle with the Labour Party suggests that May cannot win enough support within her own Conservative Party to pass her Brexit plan archived recording  theresa may The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum that both the leader of the opposition and I could put to the House for approval  and which I could then take to next week s European Council michael barbaroUnless May secures another delay  Britain is currently scheduled to leave the E U  without a negotiated plan on April 12  That s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow The president s last attempt to replace Mr  Obama s health care program blew up in 2017 when his party controlled both houses of Congress  Democrats seized the House in last year s midterm elections in part on a promise to defend the most popular parts of the Affordable Care Act  so when Mr  Trump revived the issue last week  it distressed Republicans who consider it a political liability Mr  Trump had surprised allies by ordering his administration to ask a federal court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act and then promised a Republican replacement  Democrats  consumer groups  doctors  hospitals and insurance companies have said that 20 million people could lose health coverage if courts accept the administration s argument Mr  McConnell said he spoke with Mr  Trump on Monday afternoon to explain that the Senate would not return to the issue in a broad way before the next election   I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans  view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives   Mr  McConnell said But if that warning was meant to quiet the president  it did not work  Hours later  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter   The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums  cost    deductibles than ObamaCare   In other words it will be far less expensive   much more usable than ObamaCare   he said in a string of three tweets posted Monday night   Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House  Democrats jumped at the opening  Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said at a rally in front of the Supreme Court   Translation  they have no health care plan  It s the same old song they ve been singing  They re for repeal  They have no replace  Mr  Trump appeared to be gambling that he could turn the tables on an issue that has long favored Democrats by portraying them as increasingly extreme  Even as party liberals  including some presidential candidates  embrace the idea of  Medicare for all   Republicans have used it to accuse Democrats of favoring a socialist  government run health care system that would close down all private insurers  I see what the Democrats are doing  it s a disaster what they re planning and everyone knows it   Mr  Trump told reporters on Tuesday at the White House   You re going to lose 180 million people under their private insurance  Wary of such attacks  the Democratic congressional leadership has played down a single payer system run by the government and advanced incremental measures to shore up the health care law and lower prescription drug prices Many Republicans in Congress were happy to assail Medicare for all but not enthusiastic about ditching Mr  Obama s program without a ready replacement  No plan of their own could pass the House  but it would invariably require policy choices that Democrats could attack Image The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesEven some of the president s own advisers were confounded by his move  Soon after the president decided last week to intervene in a Texas court case on the side of invalidating the entire Affordable Care Act without a Plan B  Mr  Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with Ronna McDaniel  the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee  and Brad Parscale  Mr  Trump s campaign manager Both Mr  Parscale and Ms  McDaniel tried to tell the president that they could not understand what he was doing  according to a person familiar with the call Mr  Trump replied that if they did nothing  Democrats would continue to own the issue and the other option was being known as the party that could not figure out how to properly draft a health care legislative package  the person said In several private conversations since last week  Mr  McConnell told the president that he believed Democrats owned the dysfunction associated with the Affordable Care Act and that Mr  Trump was essentially letting them off the hook by inserting himself into the debate again  according to another person briefed on those discussions Mr  Trump denied on Tuesday that Mr  McConnell asked him to back off  saying   I wanted to delay it myself  because Republicans do not control the House   So if we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency   which I hope are two good assumptions   we re going to have a phenomenal health care   he said Seeking to capitalize on the issue  the House will vote this week on a resolution urging the Justice Department to reverse its position and defend the 2010 health care law in court  forcing lawmakers to take a side on the case  The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   said Speaker Nancy Pelosi The resolution  offered by a freshman Democrat  Representative Colin Allred of Texas  says that the Justice Department should  cease any and all efforts to destroy Americans  access to affordable health care  and reverse its position  in the court case  Texas v  United States Some of the president s senior advisers pushed him to join the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the entire current health care law  a more expansive position than the administration had taken previously  when it argued that protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down But others raised concerns  including the White House counsel  Pat Cipollone  Mr  Cipollone said that Attorney General William P  Barr had issues with joining the suit  too  But once the president made clear his mind was made up  the Justice Department went along without complaint  people familiar with the events said Among those objecting was Senator Susan Collins  a moderate Republican from Maine who sent a letter to Mr  Barr expressing her  profound disagreement  with the move  Rather than seeking to have the courts invalidate the A C A    she wrote  referring to the Affordable Care Act   the proper route for the administration to pursue would be to propose changes to the A C A  or to once again seek its repeal  The administration should not attempt to use the courts to bypass Congress  Mr  McConnell sought to calm Republican nerves  saying  there s no point in pushing the panic button  because the court system would take a long time to resolve the dispute  I don t think any of these policies are in any immediate danger   he said Mr  Trump has basically commissioned four Republican senators to devise a replacement for the Affordable Care Act  The group consists of two doctors  John Barrasso of Wyoming and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana  as well as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  a close ally of the president  and Senator Rick Scott of Florida  who was the chief executive of a large for profit hospital firm before he entered politics Mr  Scott said on Tuesday that he was focused on bringing down health costs  especially prescription drug prices   Obamacare has made health care way more expensive   he said   Co payments are up  Deductibles are up  Premiums have skyrocketed  When asked about developing a wholesale replacement for the Affordable Care Act  Mr  Scott responded   I m a business guy   adding   I didn t try to do grand bargains   

WASHINGTON   His border shutdown went from imminent to uncertain  A major health care push was declared and then delayed  Funding cuts were inserted in his proposed budget and just as quickly taken out President Donald Trump has been exploring the art of the climb down Trump pivoted on two big policy fronts this week  easing up on his threats to quickly close the southern border and deciding that a fresh effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act should wait until after the 2020 election The moves came as Republicans  outside groups and aides expressed anxiety about the potential economic and political fallout from Trump s proposals The president s swift backpedaling underscored his off the cuff style and suggested that more such drama is likely ahead as he tries to sync his policymaking with his re election campaign To many  the Washington whiplash was another reminder that Trump tweets first and governs later  Most presidents and even most CEOs  when they make a decision that is going to have financial impact or personnel impact  you seek a lot of input   said Republican strategist Rick Tyler   He doesn t do that  Even his own communications staff says he goes by his gut  The president s pronouncements and social media blasts are often surprise attacks  They can vanish as quickly as they emerge if political expedience warrants a different tack His announcement last week that the GOP was going to take on health care again despite a bruising and unsuccessful effort in 2017 stunned most in his own party and seemed driven in part by a lingering desire to fulfill his oft repeated 2016 campaign promise to repeal  Obamacare  He surprised his own education secretary with the declaration that he was reversing a plan to ax federal aid for the Special Olympics after the proposed cuts sparked a public outcry Few working for him ever want to get out in front of a Trump announcement for fear it will change at the last minute Trump s latest policy twists come after the conclusion of the special counsel s Russia investigation and as the president is turning his attention to his 2020 campaign His loose style also reflects his current leadership team  Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is viewed as a less controlling figure than previous chiefs  seeking to provide Trump with analysis and information  but not trying to restrict his conversations or steer his decisions After threatening last week to seal the border if Mexico did not immediately halt all illegal immigration into the U S   Trump on Tuesday appeared to be laying the groundwork for a delay  saying he was happy with steps taken by Mexico and that he would like to see Congress pass legislation revising the immigration system  Still  he held open the possibility of a border shutdown  saying   I m totally ready to do it  Trump has been threatening the closure privately for months  but his staff has been trying to slow him down with data about the economic impact and suggestions on ways to lessen the financial hit The president acknowledged the economy was on his mind Tuesday but played down those concerns  saying   Let me just give you a little secret  Security is more important to me than trade  On health care  Trump plunged into the fight again last week  prompted by a court deadline  But his motivations were always as political as they were legislative  with the president not wanting to cede a 2020 campaign issue to Democrats  And allies stressed Tuesday that the president had never laid out a timeline for legislation With his tweet Monday night  Trump made clear there would be no vote until after the 2020 election  though he insisted a GOP plan still was in the works His downgrade came after pressure from congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who said he told Trump  we were not going to be doing that in the Senate  Asked if he was acting at McConnell s behest  Trump insisted   I wanted to delay it myself  Heading into 2020  Trump sees border security and health care as key issues for his political base and he is expected to keep pushing them even if he dials back specific threats Speaking Tuesday night at the National Republican Congressional Committee s spring dinner  he declared that Republicans  should not run away from health care   If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose   Trump said    Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Kevin Freking contributed to this report  

ANKARA  Turkey   I am a 30 year old Turkish man  and for my entire adult life there has been a ritual to elections  There s a bitterly fought campaign  the polling day arrives  people vote  ballots are counted and Recep Tayyip Erdogan wins  He stands on the balcony of his Justice and Development Party s headquarters in Ankara and gives a victory speech to a cheering crowd  If you are part of that crowd  you feel as if you have become a little more important in the world  If you aren t  you feel as if you have become a little less relevant  This sequence of events has repeated itself for 17 years  On Sunday Turkey voted to elect the mayors of its 81 provinces and their municipalities  President Erdogan s party  known as the A K P   allied itself with the ultranationalist National Movement Party  the secularist main opposition Republican People s Party  the C H P   contested in partnership with Good Party  an outfit that splintered from the nationalists in 2018  The People s Democratic Party  the H D P    which is home to Kurdish left nationalists  cooperated with the opposition alliance in several major cities while running against the A K P  in the Kurdish majority southeastern provinces  It was a brutal contest  Mr  Erdogan personally campaigned every day and repeatedly accused his opponents of being terrorist collaborators  Most opposition candidates merely presented themselves as the non Erdogan option On Sunday night  Mansur Yavas  the C H P  candidate for Ankara mayor  was comfortably ahead of his rival from the A K P   which has controlled Ankara for 25 years  Despite the momentous developments in Ankara  all eyes were fixed on Istanbul  Ekrem Imamoglu  a young  energetic C H P  candidate  was briskly tallying up votes and catching up fast with Mr  Erdogan s chosen man for Istanbul  Binali Yildirim  a former prime minister and former speaker of the Turkish Parliament Our phones were exploding with WhatsApp messages  There was a photo of Mr  Yildirim writing a short victory speech  There was Mr  Imamoglu going on air and insisting that he was leading by his campaign s calculations  People were angry because the authorities stopped publishing results as Mr  Imamoglu caught up with Mr  Yildirim in the public figures Then a news flash  Mr  Erdogan was on the balcony  But something was off  As he stepped up to the crowd  he began singing along to the song booming into the night   These roses are for you  this soul is ours  Don t be sad  don t cry  Always smile   Mr  Erdogan s speech was short and vague  He said that he was honored to carry the popular vote  and that his party had done well in many provinces  none of which he named   Those who made false claims are welcome to it   he said   let us see how they govern   This was the closest he got to admitting the calamity  His A K P  had lost Ankara and Istanbul  apart from other major cities To understand the significance of this  it helps to know the dominant narrative of Turkish politics today  It goes something like this  Throughout its republican history  Turkey has been governed by a secular elite characterized by its impish adherence to Western imperialists A group of plucky conservatives kept challenging this system until  in 1994  a young Erdogan and his friend  now dismissed  won the mayoralties of Istanbul and Ankara  respectively  Amid the economic crises  weak coalition governments and civil unrest of the 1990s  Mr  Erdogan and his associates were islands of good governance  They served these great cities with distinction and earned a reputation of incorruptibility  In 2002  their movement  now under the banner of the A K P   was elected into national office  Under Mr  Erdogan s firm leadership  they grew the economy  fixed the bureaucracy and won up to half of the popular vote  Turkey was booming  the world talked about the  Turkish model  of majority Muslim democracy  By the mid 2010s  Mr  Erdogan had defanged the coup prone military and disenfranchised the corrupt elites of old  The jealous opposition parties joined shadowy outside actors in plotting the downfall of Turkey s great revival  Some of Mr  Erdogan s friends and allies betrayed him  but  the people  did not  When the economy slowed down  or the court system got clogged up  he asked people to sacrifice for the cause of what he called  New Turkey   a nation unshackled from Western domination and free to soar to new heights But the myth of New Turkey is paradoxical  It was built on doing practical things in the 1990s  like filling potholes  But to maintain the myth  Mr  Erdogan sometimes asked voters to ignore those practical things and simply to have faith in  the cause   On Sunday  there was a major breach in this wall of faith  especially in Istanbul  where Mr  Erdogan s love of the people first transmuted into government service  This was probably due to a combination of growing economic problems and an increasingly competent opposition  It is a close count in Istanbul  and the Supreme Electoral Council has asked for three days to check everything  As things stand  it seems that Mr  Imamoglu  the young and stubbornly positive candidate of the C H P   will get the job that started Mr  Erdogan s  great love affair  with the people 25 years ago If that doesn t happen  and the A K P  holds the city  people will know that Mr  Imamoglu went up against vastly unequal odds   the government s near monopoly on TV  its abundant use of state resources  its threats of litigation   and probably still won This could signal the limits of Mr  Erdogan s political strategy  Already in this election  opposition politicians mocked the president for calling ordinary voters terrorists  He strongly denied the claim and sued one of them  In a recently viral video  an old woman asked   Why should the man governing Turkey make a distinction between the people  Are those  opposition  parties always evil and you  Erdogan  are good  When populist rhetoric comes from a fresh face and aims at a calcified elite  it sounds plausible  When it has supplanted that elite  and it has reached its demographic limits  it begins to look ridiculous  And therein lies the problem of Mr  Erdogan s politics  He isn t honest with himself  He wants to dominate the political space and transform the country  but he isn t quite willing to engage in the scale of repression that would require  He demonizes his opposition as terrorist collaborators  yet still allows them to participate in elections  Mr  Erdogan s style of politics demands that he either crank up the intensity  or collapse under the weight of its own contradictions Selim Koru is an analyst at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara and a

WASHINGTON   In President Donald Trump s estimation  the 2020 census will be pointless unless a question is added that asks people if they are citizens That opinion makes him a distinct outlier in government  business and society  where the big census conducted every 10 years produces a gold mine of information on how people live and  of course  how many there are TRUMP   Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question  Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together     tweet Monday THE FACTS  Trump s disdain for conducting the once a decade census without a citizenship question is not shared by his own Census Bureau researchers  Nor is it consistent with the many operations of government and business that make billions of dollars in spending decisions as well as policy decisions based on the most accurate possible count of the U S  population According to January 2018 calculations by the Census Bureau  adding a citizenship question to the decennial census form would cause lower response rates among noncitizens  leading to an increased cost to the government of at least  27 5 million for additional phone calls  visits to the home and other follow up efforts to reach them  The Constitution requires a count every 10 years of  the whole number of persons in each state   long understood to include all residents of the U S The count goes to the heart of the U S  political system  It s used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House and how the electoral votes that decide presidential elections are distributed It also shapes how 300 federal programs distribute more than  800 billion a year to local communities  according to an analysis by the GW Institute of Public Policy at George Washington University  Communities and businesses depend on it  as well  in deciding where to build schools  hospitals  job training centers  grocery stores and more The GW institute s analysis of the effects of an undercount on five programs administered by the Health and Human Services Department  for instance  found that 37 states lost a median of  1 091 in the 2015 budget year for each person missed in the 2010 census Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has argued that a citizenship question is needed   or is  very important   as Trump puts it   to help the government better comply with the Voting Rights Act  But the Justice Department has been enforcing the 1965 law  which was passed to help protect minority groups  political rights  with citizenship data already available from other government surveys Meantime  civil rights groups and states with higher shares of immigrant populations such as California and New York cite a greater harm to the political rights of minority groups if a citizenship question in the decennial census dissuades immigrants from participating  resulting in diminished representation in the U S  House Not since 1950 has the census collected citizenship data from the whole population The Supreme Court this month is hearing the Trump administration s appeal of a federal judge s ruling in New York that Ross  whose department oversees the census  violated federal law by making an  arbitrary and capricious  decision that twisted contrary evidence  A judge in California also has ruled that a citizenship question would violate the Constitution s requirement to count the population    Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

Pete Buttigieg has some kind of magic right now  His campaign bio   Shortest Way Home   was the 25th best selling book on Amazon when I checked on Monday  That put him just a few dozen places behind Michelle Obama  and thousands or tens of thousands of places ahead of Kamala Harris  Bernie Sanders and the other candidates who have campaign books out now In a recent Iowa poll he surged to third place  His campaign just announced that it s raised an impressive  7 million since January  And I can t tell you how many Democrats in places as diverse as Nebraska  Indiana  New York and Washington have come up to me over the last few weeks raving about the guy  I met a superfan in Frederick  Md   who says that every few hours she calls the campaign to give another  10  This is the biggest star is born moment since Lady Gaga started singing  Shallow  Why are people so in love with the mayor of South Bend  Ind   who almost nobody had heard of until he did a CNN town hall on March 10 It s important to remember that when Democrats vote next year  they ll not only be choosing a policy alternative to Donald Trump  they ll also be making a statement about what kind of country they want America to be The Trump era has been all about dissolving moral norms and waging vicious attacks  This has been an era of culture war  class warfare and identity politics  It s been an era in which call out culture  reality TV melodrama and tribal grandstanding have overshadowed policymaking and the challenges of actually governing The Buttigieg surge suggests that there are a lot of Democrats who want to say goodbye to all that  They don t want to fight fire and divisiveness with more fire and divisiveness  They don t want to fight white identity politics with another kind of identity politics They are sick of the moral melodrama altogether  They just want a person who is more about governing than virtue signaling  more about friendliness and basic decency than media circus and rhetorical war Buttigieg s secret is that he transcends many of the tensions that run through our society in a way that makes people on all sides feel comfortable First  he is young and represents the rising generation  but he is also an older person s idea of what a young person should be  He d be the first millennial president  but Buttigieg doesn t fit any of the stereotypes that have been affixed to America s young people  Young people are supposed to be woke social justice warriors who are disgusted by their elders  Buttigieg is the model young man who made his way impressing his elders   Harvard  Rhodes scholar  McKinsey  the Navy  Young hipsters are supposed to flock to coastal places like Brooklyn and Portland  after college  Buttigieg returned to Indiana  Young people are supposed to be anti institutional  but Buttigieg is very institutional   his life has been defined by his service to organizations  not his rebellion against them Second  he is gay and personifies the progress made by the L G B T Q  movement  but he doesn t do so in a way that feels threatening or transgressive to social conservatives  He has conservative family values  it s just that his spouse is a husband  not a wife  He speaks comfortably about his faith and says that when he goes to church he prefers a conservative liturgy to anything experimental Third  he is a localist and a Washington outsider  but he carries no populist resentment and can easily speak the language of the coastal elite Buttigieg has spent his political career in Indiana  where pols are expected to go to county fairs and eat the catfish fillet and cheesecake on a stick  He wasn t alive when the Studebaker plant shut down in South Bend  but he has the trauma of Midwestern deindustrialization in his bones  He lives in a house near his mother where the mortgage comes to about  450 a month  On the other hand  he was friends with Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard  earned a first at Oxford and thrived as a corporate consultant Finally  he s a progressive on policy issues  but he doesn t sound like an angry revolutionary  Buttigieg s policy positions are not all that different from the more identifiable leftist candidates  But he eschews grand ideological conflict   The whole point of politics is everyday life   he said in his CNN town hall  His book is mostly about how as mayor he faced problems like snow removal and fixing potholes  His big achievements were renaming city streets  repairing the sewer system and tearing down derelict buildings  He says he ll do whatever works I ve only met Buttigieg once  when we were seated at the same table at a dinner in Detroit a few months ago  He was smart  modest and self effacing  and I can t square that impression with his assumption that at 37 he s qualified to be president of the United States  But maybe that s Buttigieg   he squares a lot of circles  He deftly detaches progressive policy positions from the culture war  He offers change without Sturm und Drang The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email

The chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and one of the state s leading political donors together sought to use campaign contributions to bribe the state s insurance commissioner  federal prosecutors said in an indictment that was unsealed on Tuesday The 23 page indictment   detailed with accounts of clandestine airport meetings and promises of millions of dollars in illicit donations   intensified the political tumult in a state already roiled by partisan warfare and a fraud tainted congressional election  And it also showed how  at least in the judgment of prosecutors  a leading political operative and one of his most important benefactors tried to shape government oversight in one of the nation s largest states  These men crossed the line from fund raising to felonies when they devised a plan to use their connections to a political party to attempt to influence the operations and policies of the North Carolina Department of Insurance   said John A  Strong  the special agent in charge of the F B I  office in Charlotte  N C The party chairman  Robin Hayes  faces the gravest set of charges of the four men who were indicted  Mr  Hayes was accused of bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud  along with several counts of making false statements  Three other people  including Greg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham and a prolific Republican contributor  were also charged Kearns Davis  a lawyer for Mr  Hayes  said the 73 year old Republican  steadfastly denies the allegations made against him in this case   In a separate statement  Anne Tompkins  a lawyer for Mr  Lindberg  said that Mr  Lindberg was  innocent of the charges in the indictment and we look forward to demonstrating this when we get our day in court  It was not clear whether the other men who were charged had lawyers A federal magistrate in Charlotte unsealed the case on Tuesday after the men were arrested   a public milestone in an investigation that began early last year with a tip from Mike Causey  the insurance commissioner According to the indictment  Mr  Lindberg  who has also given to Democrats  wanted Mr  Causey to oust a powerful regulator  in exchange for millions of dollars in campaign contributions   The targeted state official was in charge of overseeing North Carolina s regulation of a company that Mr  Lindberg owned  and Mr  Lindberg complained to Mr  Causey in February 2018 that the official was  deliberately and intentionally and maliciously hurting my reputation with other regulators  Mr  Lindberg said the official had been  lying  to Mr  Causey The next month  federal officials said  Mr  Lindberg and Mr  Causey met alone at the Statesville Regional Airport  What s in it for me   Mr  Causey asked Mr  Lindberg  according to the indictment Mr  Lindberg replied that he would support the commissioner s campaign for re election Mr  Hayes  one of the most influential political figures in the state  emerged as someone who could help carry out the plan  Federal officials said that Mr  Hayes knew at least some of the plot in May 2018 and  less than three months later  tried to disguise part of the bribe by arranging to transfer to the Causey campaign  250 000 that Mr  Lindberg had given to the state party Before the transfer  one of Mr  Lindberg s consultants  John D  Gray  called Mr  Hayes to say the men had  come to the conclusion that it would be better for all of us  if the money for the Causey campaign was funneled through the Republican Party  O K   well  if that s what you want to do  we can do it   Mr  Hayes replied  according to the indictment   It looks a little odd to have that much at one time  You know  we were talking about putting it over  you know  so much a month so it didn t jump out  but that s what you want to do  we can do it  Within weeks  prosecutors said  Mr  Hayes lied to F B I  agents about his efforts In a statement on Tuesday  Mr  Causey said his department  continues to cooperate with the federal authorities on this investigation   He otherwise declined to comment The indictment landed at a perilous moment for the Republican Party in North Carolina  Although Donald J  Trump carried the state in 2016  Democrats seized the governor s office that year  and last year s elections eroded the Republican supermajority in the General Assembly The party also suffered a stinging embarrassment in February  when the State Board of Elections ordered a new vote in the Ninth Congressional District after the Republican nominee s campaign financed an illicit voter turnout operation during the general election  Although no major Republican Party figures have been charged with wrongdoing  the man who coordinated the improper effort was indicted in connection with wrongdoing in earlier elections  and state and federal officials are conducting parallel inquiries into the general election  Read  A new election was ordered in North Carolina s Ninth Congressional District  On Monday  Mr  Hayes announced that he would not seek another term as state party chairman  In a statement announcing the decision  the party cited  recent  although temporary  issues with his mobility  After Mr  Hayes s indictment was announced on Tuesday  a lawyer for the state party  Josh Howard  said the party had become  aware of several indictments surrounding the conduct of a major donor to both major political parties and two of his associates  Mr  Howard  who spoke of the party s cooperation during the federal inquiry  did not mention that its leader had also been charged  

WASHINGTON   The NATO secretary general gave a strong defense of the 70 year old military alliance between Europe and the United States  using a high profile appearance before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to urge allies to stand up to a more assertive Russia While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not looking for a new Cold War with Moscow  the alliance s leader  Jens Stoltenberg  said it was important to not be  naïve  about the Kremlin s intentions  Proffering a long list of Russian actions that threaten NATO allies  including the annexation of Crimea  the use of a nerve agent in Britain and Moscow s interference in democratic elections  Mr  Stoltenberg cited  a pattern of Russian behavior  that calls for the alliance to be more united than ever in its response  NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence   Mr  Stoltenberg said at the Capitol  He was in Washington for a meeting of foreign ministers from NATO member states But his remarks came in the middle of a poorly timed squabble between two of the alliance s fractious members   the United States and Turkey   with Russia as the potential beneficiary  Earlier this week  the Pentagon announced that it was halting the delivery of parts for F 35 fighter jets to Turkey because Ankara is pursuing plans to buy S 400 missile defense systems from Russia American officials do not want Turkey to purchase the Russian system and have warned that it could collect information on United States stealth fighter jets The Turkish foreign minister  Mevlut Cavusoglu  was adamant in a separate alliance event in Washington on Wednesday that Ankara will not budge   It s a done deal   he said   Turkey doesn t have to choose between Russia and any others  and we don t see our relationship with Russia as an alternative to others  But the Trump administration  so far  is being equally adamant  Turkey must choose   Vice President Mike Pence said at a NATO anniversary event   Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history  or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making such reckless decisions that undermine our alliance  Mr  Stoltenberg  in his speech before Congress  did not directly reference the F 35 squabble  But he characterized fights among alliance partners as  democracy   Open discussions and different views is not a sign of weakness   Mr  Stoltenberg said   It is a sign of strength  He also reaffirmed NATO s core mandate of collective defense   that an attack on one member state is viewed as an attack on all 29  But in doing so  Mr  Stoltenberg aired a principle that President Trump has questioned  exposing the new rift that has developed between his administration and the United States  most important allies Wednesday s speech was the first time that a secretary general of the alliance has been invited to speak on Congress s most high profile stage  and the platform afforded to Mr  Stoltenberg was in many ways a sign of lawmakers  concerns over Mr  Trump s commitment to NATO Mr  Stoltenberg  a careful diplomat  made no criticism of Mr  Trump  and instead credited the president with prodding the alliance to spend more on defense  Still  the overall theme of Mr  Stoltenberg s speech was to make the case for NATO  the value of which Mr  Trump has often questioned Lawmakers gave Mr  Stoltenberg a series of standing ovations  Legislation that has bipartisan support is making its way through Congress  and would explicitly prohibit any president from withdrawing the United States from the alliance without Senate approval In his speech  which was peppered with political and personal details  Mr  Stoltenberg said the military alliance has been good not just for Europe  but for the United States as well  He reminded lawmakers that the only time NATO has invoked Article 5   the pact of collective defense following attacks   was after the terrorist strikes against the United States on Sept  11  2001  The strength of a nation   Mr  Stoltenberg said   is not only measured by the size of its economy or the number of its soldiers  but also by the number of its friends   And through NATO  the United States has more friends and allies than any other power   he said   This has made the United States stronger  safer and more secure   

LOVE YOUR ENEMIES How Decent People Can Save America From the Culture of Contempt By Arthur C  BrooksArthur C  Brooks begins  Love Your Enemies  with a scene  a moment of grace  that occurred on the National Mall in Washington on Sept  16  2017  during a rally of Trump supporters  A counter demonstrator from Black Lives Matter  a man named Hawk Newsome  was  quite unexpectedly  invited to address the Trump supporters  Quite unexpectedly  he won them over   a little bit  anyway  Newsome ended by saying   If we really want to make America great  we do it together   The Trumpers cheered  and the better angels of our nature flapped about the Mall for a little while  The mystic chords of memory reverberated from one side of the American divide to the other Was that moment a model for the future  Or just an accident Love your enemies  In this America   Maybe this seems impossible to you   Brooks writes   You might say   There are some people who are simply beyond the pale  There are millions of awful people in this country who advocate ideas we cannot tolerate  They deserve our contempt  not our love   I have heard this sentiment from serious journalists  respected academics and mainstream politicians  I have thought it myself  That attitude is both wrong and dangerously radical  Anyone who can t tell the difference between an ordinary Bernie Sanders supporter and a Stalinist revolutionary  or between Donald Trump s average voter and a Nazi  is either willfully ignorant or needs to get out of the house more  Brooks beholds America s 21st century tribal feuds   which on a national scale add up to nothing less than a religious war  a clash of faiths and value systems   with a clear  intelligent eye and a hospitable attitude that is rightly focused on the spiritual dimensions of the problem  Only transcendence can open the way to better solutions down the road  The real swamp just now is in the American mind ImageAs for Brooks s mind  it is filled with unusual ingredients  He is the rational first mate Starbuck to the Ahab of American political looniness   a voice of civic urbanity  The outgoing head of the American Enterprise Institute  an influential conservative think tank in Washington  he is an advocate for free enterprise and a serious Catholic  a convert in his midteens  who has gone up into the foothills of the Himalayas to seek counsel from his friend the Dalai Lama  He draws not only upon neurology and behavioral science but also upon the ideas of Dale Carnegie s  How to Win Friends and Influence People   A policy analyst with a Ph D  who has studied applied microeconomics and mathematical modeling  he spent years of his somewhat hippie lefty youth playing the French horn with  among others  the Barcelona Symphony The essence of our woes  according to Brooks  is that ours is a  culture of contempt    My point is simple  Love and warmheartedness might not change every heart and mind  but they are always worth trying  and they will always make you better off   Brooks cites the interesting friendship of two professors at Princeton  the white conservative Robert George and the black socialist Cornel West  Their mutual respect and affection  despite their disagreement on practically everything  embodies  to Brooks  the answer to the culture of contempt  George says of West   When I call Brother Cornel  Brother Cornel   I mean he s my brother   As with these two professors  Brooks suggests  America s path forward lies in its learning to transcend self destructive  obsessive politics in order to think clearly and to use the intelligent competition of ideas to advance the country  Love Your Enemies  can be seen as an informal handbook of attitudes and behaviors  Castiglione for the Twitter age  The reader may be left torn between admiring it as an example of Kafka s  A book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us   or dismissing it with Hemingway s  Isn t it pretty to think so  That this is an age of contempt and ridicule is certainly true   Donald Trump vs   Saturday Night Live   and a lot that is far more scurrilous than that  But contempt and ridicule are ancient American political art forms   ones now brought to ferocious intensity by the internet and social media  The smartphone paradoxically engenders new levels of mindlessness It may be that American contempt and ridicule had their most entertaining expression a century ago in the work of H  L  Mencken  a master of bracing satirical bombast who was disgracefully unjust and cruel in many of his opinions  Mencken would probably have dismissed Brooks as a sentimentalist    an evangelist   in Mencken s scornful term  A useful and welcome evangelist  I d say

WASHINGTON   U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross refused to testify about his department s 2020 budget before a congressional panel on Wednesday  an act its chairman called one of  stunning disrespect  that left lawmakers facing an empty chair Ross  who was invited to testify at a hearing but instead tried to send aides to a speak on his behalf  has been criticized in the Democratic controlled House of Representatives over his efforts to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census  an issue now before the U S  Supreme Court Ross said in a statement after the hearing of a House subcommittee on Appropriations   I am disappointed that these Department of Commerce leaders have not been allowed to discuss their respective budgets for 2020  Ross has said he sought the citizenship question in the census to bolster the Voting Rights Act  But Democrats view it as an attempt to discourage immigrants and Latinos from participating in the census  which could lead to an undercount in Democratic leaning states Non citizens make up an estimated 7 percent of people living in the United States  The citizenship question has not appeared on the list of questions asked of all households since the 1950 census  but has featured since then on questionnaires sent to a smaller subsection of the population The U S  Constitution requires a census to count all residents  including non citizens  every 10 years  Results are used to draw political boundaries  allocate seats in Congress and distribute roughly  800 billion of federal funds  The top Republican on the Appropriations subcommittee  Robert Aderholt  said Ross failed to appear out of  concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself  Some have speculated it might turn into a debate over the 2020 census  Aderholt noted Ross had sent senior officials to answer questions the panel might have about the Commerce Department s  12 billion budget request  but the panel s Democratic chairman  Jose Serrano  ruled that out  That will not be happening  This subcommittee invited Secretary Ross to testify and he s the only one who will be allowed to testify at this hearing   Serrano told the panel as members sat before an empty witness table marked with Ross  name  The secretary s actions today show a stunning disrespect for the mechanisms of our democracy   Serrano added It is routine for department heads to field questions from lawmakers each year about their budget requests and other matters  A different House panel  the Committee on Oversight and Reform  voted on Tuesday to authorize a subpoena for documents from Ross about his efforts to include the citizenship question   Reporting by David Alexander and Mohammad Zargham  Editing by Peter Cooney and Grant McCool  

WASHINGTON   Pete Buttigieg announced Monday that his presidential campaign had raised more than  7 million in the first quarter of 2019  a significant sum for a mayor who was little known outside of South Bend  Ind   only a few months ago Mr  Buttigieg  37  is the first presidential contender to disclose an estimate of his fund raising total for the quarter  The haul is expected to place him  financially  in the upper half of a sprawling 2020 primary field that features a half dozen senators  This is a big number for us   Mr  Buttigieg wrote to supporters in an email on Monday   We are not part of the national political machine  We started with just about 20 000 people on our email list  and not many people even knew who I was  Mr  Buttigieg s announcement kicks off a highly anticipated moment in the 2020 campaign s opening phase  when the Democratic hopefuls will reveal their fund raising totals for the first three months of the year  Those results offer early evidence of who is generating excitement among the party s grass roots  an especially important factor this year given the intense focus on raising money from small donors  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  Already  Senator Bernie Sanders and former Representative Beto O Rourke have announced sizable fund raising hauls from the first 24 hours of their campaigns  Senator Elizabeth Warren has lagged in early fund raising  she is trying to distinguish herself from the Democratic field by forgoing high dollar fund raisers Presidential candidates must report their first quarter fund raising to the Federal Election Commission by April 15  It is up to the individual campaigns to decide when   or whether   to announce their totals before then  Mr  Buttigieg s quick announcement on Monday  immediately after the close of the first quarter  allowed him to command the spotlight  at least for a few hours  as he seeks to establish his candidacy as more than a long shot bid  Showing good numbers early is more impressive for a long shot candidate who doesn t have a big national identification   said Michael J  Malbin  the director of the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute There are signs beyond fund raising that Mr  Buttigieg is drawing interest  or at least curiosity  from voters  Searches for his name on Google have shot up in recent weeks  In a ranking of Democrats running for president or considering it  Mr  Buttigieg has risen from the bottom of the pack to No  2  trailing only former Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr For most of this year  for example  Mr  O Rourke has drawn more searches than Mr  Buttigieg  but Mr  Buttigieg recently surpassed him  according to the Google data Mr  Buttigieg s fund raising haul of more than  7 million came from 158 550 donors  with an average contribution of  36 35  Mr  Buttigieg said in a video posted online late Monday  He added that 64 percent of the total came from contributions under  200 Mr  Buttigieg  who is technically still only exploring a campaign  said last month that he had exceeded the 65 000 donors needed to garner a spot on the Democratic National Committee s primary debate stage  even as some better known rivals have suggested they do not yet have that many Mr  Buttigieg s fund raising jumped after he appeared in a CNN town hall style event earlier in March and impressed Democratic activists and donors  as he fielded questions in rolled up white shirt sleeves and a blue tie  His campaign announced that he raised  600 000 in the 24 hours after his appearance Lis Smith  a spokeswoman for the campaign  described the televised forum as a turning point  Interest in Mr  Buttigieg had been rising before then  she said  but the CNN event  really brought everything to the next level   Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker  An openly gay veteran and former Rhodes scholar  Mr  Buttigieg has made numerous appearances on national television in recent weeks seeking to lift his political profile  Later last month he told supporters via email that he was setting a  500 000 fund raising goal by the end of the month  He hit the figure within 24 hours  his campaign said  He set another  500 000 goal  Again  he reached it in about 24 hours Mr  Buttigieg s fund raising is particularly noteworthy because he began his campaign with only a modest email list from which he could solicit donations   a stark contrast with rivals like Mr  Sanders and Mr  O Rourke  who built huge followings in their prior campaigns for president and Senate In addition  Mr  Buttigieg has spent relatively little money on advertising on Facebook  which many candidates use to expand their email lists  There s no sorcery involved in this   Ms  Smith said of Mr  Buttigieg s fund raising   It was because he really struck a chord  Unlike many of the Democrats in the race   including Ms  Warren and Senators Cory Booker  Kirsten Gillibrand  Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar   Mr  Buttigieg has not publicly sworn off federal lobbyist funds  Mr  Buttigieg is refusing to accept corporate political action committee money and recently signed a pledge to not take money from the oil  gas and coal industries Other candidates are still expected to post larger sums than Mr  Buttigieg for the quarter  Mr  Sanders raised  10 million in the first week of his presidential bid  a total that included  5 9 million from the first 24 hours  his campaign said Mr  O Rourke s campaign said it had raised  6 1 million in his first 24 hours as a candidate  On Sunday  it reached its goal of raising  1 million during the final weekend of the quarter  the campaign said  

PARIS   Algeria s ailing president  Abdelaziz Bouteflika  agreed Monday to step down by the end of the month  yielding to weeks of mass demonstrations demanding his ouster The initial reaction in Algeria was muted  and it was unclear whether the announcement would quell the protests  which have been calling for not only Mr  Bouteflika s resignation but the end of  the system  he led With no date set for a new election and no sign of the departure of Mr  Bouteflika s allies  some of his opponents were skeptical about the prospect of immediate  fundamental changes  Who is going to replace President Bouteflika   asked Smain Kouadria  a former member of Parliament and an activist in the opposition Workers  Party   All the senators are children of the system  So this announcement of his resignation is simply part of the rescue operation for a dying system  ImageProtesters demonstrating against Mr  Bouteflika in Algiers last month  The protests have only grown larger despite his previous concessions CreditRamzi Boudina ReutersMr  Bouteflika  82  who has ruled Algeria for 20 years  is paralyzed and has not publicly addressed the country since 2013  The protests began last month after he announced that he would run for a fifth term  and they have escalated each week With support from his former allies steadily dropping away  the final blow for Mr  Bouteflika came last week when the powerful army chief of staff called on the country s Constitutional Council to declare Mr  Bouteflika unfit to hold office But even though Mr  Bouteflika is departing  much of the ruling elite he put in place   which protesters refer to simply as  the system    is not On Sunday night  Mr  Bouteflika even appointed a new government  naming the general who had called for his ouster

likeliest to assume the position of interim president is the head of the senate  who has been close to Mr  Bouteflika for years A stage managed departure seemed unlikely to satisfy the street  which has increasingly helped drive the country s political agenda  an unusual development in Algeria s nearly 60 year  post independence history Even some opposition leaders who welcomed the news on Monday urged continued protests  It s a first important victory for the people   said Said Salhi  vice president of the Algerian Human Rights League   But we can t stop here  We ve got to demand positive change toward the emergence of a new  democratic republic   We ve got to continue to mobilize   he added   It s our only guarantee of movement toward final victory  which is the construction of a new republic of rights and liberties  ImageA protest demanding the resignation of Mr  Bouteflika on March 29  The protests began in February with demonstrations calling for him to desist from seeking a fifth term CreditRamzi Boudina ReutersThe situation in Algeria is fluid  with the balance of power appearing to shift every day  It is unclear how much more protest the army  which traditionally is the ultimate arbiter  will tolerate  Nor is it clear how radical the protesters will become in their demands There were other signs Monday of a shift in power  with the authorities seizing the passports of 12 businessmen on corruption allegations  according to Ennahar television  which is usually well informed  The government news service confirmed that corruption investigations had been opened against  some people  While it was not clear why the 12 were targeted  a businessman arrested on Sunday is considered a Bouteflika crony  Ali Haddad  the country s wealthiest man  who owns the country s top construction firm and has grown wealthy from lucrative state contracts  was arrested at the Tunisian border Mr  Haddad is known to be close to Mr  Bouteflika s hitherto influential brother  Said The question for Algerians now is whether Mr  Bouteflika s resignation will lead to real change or whether it is another in a series of feints intended to allow him and his system to retain power ImageNoureddine Bedoui  center  was re appointed as prime minister of Algeria s new government  He is widely described as inflexible CreditRyad Kramdi Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe protest movement began in late February with mass demonstrations calling for Mr  Bouteflika to desist from seeking a fifth term  After Mr  Bouteflika agreed to call new elections if he won the election  originally scheduled for April 18  the protests only grew larger Then he said he would not seek a fifth term  but would remain in office until a successor was chosen in an election that was indefinitely postponed  That offer only seemed to embolden the protesters  who demanded that he step down immediately and that his system had to go as well This is a far more complicated demand  and those who have been pulling the strings for years in Algeria   the army and an extensive nexus of politicians  top businessmen and high civil servants   have been improvising to keep up with the largely peaceful demonstrators  who have turned out in increasing numbers each Friday Mr  Bouteflika learned at the knee of his mentor  the revolutionary leader Houari Boumédiène  who ruled Algeria from the mid 1960s to the late 1970s  Like Mr  Boumédiène  Mr  Bouteflika installed an extensive patronage network and governed in partnership with the army  The system they and other Algerian rulers put in place is solidly anchored and will probably take more than a month s worth of popular demonstrations to dislodge The muted reaction on Monday suggested that Algerians know that  So Bouteflika is finished  Now everyone knows it   said Atmane Mazouz  a member of Parliament from the opposition Rally for Culture and Democracy party   The struggles now are only little positioning wars to control the next phase of the transition  But I am almost certain that the mobilization of Algerians will continue stronger than ever  because all the decisions being made now are seen by Algerians as a conspiracy against their revolution

CAIRO   In his desire to wield sweeping power  President Abdel Fattah el Sisi of Egypt has suppressed politics  cowed the media and jailed legions of opponents Now he is extending his iron grip to a new corner of Egyptian society  the country s cherished soap operas Every year during the holy month of Ramadan  Egyptians crowd around their televisions to gorge on big budget mini series starring the country s top actors  including weepy melodramas  police procedurals and sweeping historical epics  The best are exported across the Middle East But the crop of shows currently in production for Ramadan are being subjected to suffocating controls  Mr  el Sisi s officials are dictating scripts and capping wages  directors and actors say  A military linked production company has taken charge of some of the biggest shows Filmmakers have been told their stories should follow approved themes  like praising the army and the police  or vilifying the banned Muslim Brotherhood  Those who don t play by the rules don t get on the air  For Sisi  this is not just about politics or power   said Ezzedine Choukri Fishere  a writer and former diplomat whose novels have been adopted into TV serials   He wants to re educate the Egyptian public  ImagePresident Abdel Fattah el Sisi  at an Arab summit meeting in Tunis on Sunday  is extending his grip to a new corner of Egyptian society  soap operas CreditZoubeir Souissi ReutersThe soap opera clampdown is the cultural edge of a far reaching and intrusive brand of authoritarianism that has taken root in Egypt under Mr  el Sisi  reaching new levels even for a country that has been governed by military backed strongmen for decades Hosni Mubarak  who governed for 30 years until his ouster in the 2011 Arab Spring  also presided over an oppressive  often cruel system  Even so  he allowed space for other centers of power  like his political party and the senior judiciary  which could result in surprising actions  Now and then  judges issued rulings that discomfited him  Newspapers could criticize him to a point  In 2005  the opposition Muslim Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in Parliament That space  limited as it was  has been virtually shut down under Mr  el Sisi  who came to power in a 2013 military takeover  He governs through a small clique of advisers  mostly drawn from the military  the security services and his family  that enjoys huge economic clout  sees the world through a security prism and has sought to stamp out every breath of dissent  Egyptians can be arrested for politically incorrect Facebook posts  I would frankly feel safer talking politics in Damascus than in Cairo   said Yezid Sayigh  a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut  Mr  el Sisi s personalist autocracy  he continued   tries to dominate the public space so completely that nobody dares say anything  even in private  that might be deemed dissent by those in power   That fear is what all totalitarian systems try to instill  that even when the system cannot eavesdrop on you  it can hear you  A government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Mr  el Sisi s approach has met with little resistance from President Trump  who is scheduled to host him at the White House next week  Where Washington once was a modest brake on the excesses of Egypt s strongmen  Mr  Trump has lavished praise on Mr  el Sisi in previous encounters   even complimenting his taste in footwear   but has said little about the tightening vise of repression in Egypt The United States has not had an ambassador in Cairo since July 2017 Mr  el Sisi s governing circle is dominated by military men he trusts  The army s Engineering Authority has been charged with overseeing ambitious projects worth billions of dollars  including an extension of the Suez Canal that was completed in 2015 and a new administrative capital that is under construction in the desert east of Cairo ImageThe set of the soap opera

little public oversight  prosecuting actors and political opponents as well as terrorism suspects  Mr  el Sisi s intelligence agencies quietly manipulate the workings of Parliament  which is currently debating sweeping constitutional changes that would extend Mr  el Sisi s term until 2034 and could also bring the senior judiciary directly under his authority  a power Mr  Mubarak never had Television talk shows  once a ferment of raucous debate  have become so predictably pro government that many Egyptians are tuning out  The foreign ministry  once a bastion of Egypt s proud diplomatic tradition  is viewed as a much reduced force  Sisi is not Kim Jong Un or Saddam Hussein   said Amy Hawthorne of the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington   But he s inching Egypt toward that kind of regime  The hand of the security agencies also extends deep into the economy  often blurring the line between national security and commerce As the ride sharing company Uber has expanded in Egypt  it has faced government demands to provide access to personal information about its customers  In February  as the security agencies stepped up those demands  the Uber app started to crash in Egypt  said an official with knowledge of talks between Uber and the Egyptian government But it is in his pursuit of culture and the arts that Mr  el Sisi has really stood out Last month the celebrated author Alaa al Aswany  who wrote The Yacoubian Building  said a secret military court had prosecuted him for  inciting hatred against the regime    a prosecution all the more striking because Mr  al Aswany was once an avowed el Sisi supporter In January  Amr Waked  an actor who starred in the Hollywood movie  Syriana   said in a Twitter post that he had been sentenced to eight years in prison for criticizing Mr  el Sisi  Last week  the Egypt s Actors Union expelled Mr  Waked  who lives in Europe  and another prominent actor for  high treason  after they attended a

positive principles  of older  state produced TV shows  and criticized recent productions  In the following years  state officials started to press filmmakers through both censorship and quiet pressure This season  though  the meddling has created an industry crisis  by several accounts With Ramadan just a month away  the number of mini series currently under production has been cut in half  to about 12 or 15  one director said The Egyptian Media Group  a company with links to the General Intelligence Service  has established the dominant TV production company and bought several of the biggest TV networks  according to Mada Masr  one of the last independent news outlets left in Egypt A senior director  speaking on the condition of anonymity  said scriptwriters were ordered this winter to follow certain guidelines  to glorify the military  to attack the Muslim Brotherhood and to promote conservative family values that encourage young Egyptians to obey their elders   and presumably avoid the kind of questioning that led to the 2011 Arab Spring  the director said The directive is a sign of another major difference between Mr  el Sisi and Mr  Mubarak  said Mr  Ezzidine  the analyst  who lives in the United States While Mr  Mubarak often seemed content to simply manage Egypt s dysfunction  Mr  Sisi appears intent on reshaping the country s moral and intellectual fiber  He has lectured citizens on their manners and their physical fitness  Now he wants to purge what he views as dangerous currents of thought Mr  el Sisi s defenders say Egypt needs a strong leader to protect the country from the chaos that has engulfed Libya  Syria and Yemen  and to enact long overdue yet unpopular  harsh economic reforms  like recent cuts to fuel and electricity subsidies  Egypt s stability has contributed to a 16 percent increase in tourism in the past year  and the energy sector is booming after major gas discoveries in the Mediterranean ImageEgypt s Parliament held

saw as a sign of mismanagement of basic services  He hoped to attract more protesters  But he was arrested within minutes and bundled into a police van alongside a friend who had filmed his solo protest In the back of the van  Mr  Mohy recorded an impassioned  sometimes tearful video message that was posted on Facebook  He would probably be tortured for speaking out  he said  but he insisted it had been worth it  Maybe they will inject us  maybe they will kill us  maybe they will burn us   said Mr  Mohy  whose Facebook page is filled with his poetry   But we are facing our destiny as men  With tens of thousands of opponents already in jail  such acts of public resistance are rare  and Mr  el Sisi s authority faces few obvious challenges for now Mr  el Sisi s view is that his strength comes from divine providence In a 2013 interview  he told a journalist that a voice had come to him in a dream and said   We will grant you what no one has had before  But some analysts warn that  in seeking to exert such tight control over the Egyptian state and society  Mr  el Sisi might be sowing the seeds of his eventual undoing Presiding over such a top heavy system that has alienated so many sectors of society could leave Mr  el Sisi vulnerable on the day his system inevitably faces an unforeseen shock  said Mr  Sayigh  the senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center  Sisi and the army have painted themselves into a corner by destroying anyone they could talk to   Mr  Sayigh said   When the day comes where they need others in government or business  they may have nobody to support them   

Senator Kamala Harris announced Monday night that her 2020 campaign raised  12 million in her first two plus months running for president  a sum that is expected to vault her into the top tier of financial competitors in the wide open Democratic primary Ms  Harris  a first term senator from California  invested heavily building an online network of donors in the two years leading up to her launch  spending millions of dollars to increase the size of her email supporter list  Her campaign said more than  6 million of her fund raising   about half of her total   came from her digital program  including  1 1 million in the last week Candidates must disclose their fund raising figures for the first quarter of 2019 by April 15  though many release them earlier in an attempt to position themselves better politically ahead of the full report Ms  Harris s campaign said she had received 218 000 contributions in total and that 98 percent of her contributions were under  100  Her average donation was about  55  Her campaign did not say how much of her total those small contributions accounted for  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race   A nationwide network of hundreds of thousands of grass roots supporters has stepped up to lay the foundation for a winning campaign   said Juan Rodriguez  Ms  Harris s campaign manager  in a statement Ms  Harris has also raised money aggressively on the traditional fund raising circuit and spent the final weekend of March dashing across California  from the Bay Area to Los Angeles  to raise as much as possible ahead of the first disclosure deadline of the 2020 race  Her campaign said only 0 55 percent of her individual donors gave the legal maximum of  2 800   though that is still hundreds of contributors Earlier on Monday  Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   announced that he had raised more than  7 million in the first quarter  Mr  Buttigieg s campaign said he had 158 550 donors who gave an average donation of  36 35  About 64 percent of his  7 million came from contributions of less than  200 Neither Ms  Harris nor Mr  Buttigieg disclosed how much cash on hand their campaigns currently have On Tuesday  senior advisers to Senator Bernie Sanders  who is widely expected to post the largest fund raising haul this month  are scheduled to release his fund raising figures  In emails to supporters  Mr  Sanders s campaign has said he had nearly 900 000 contributions in the first quarter  writing in one email that donations were  about a  20 average this time   His average donation was  27 in 2016  suggesting he has raised somewhere between  18 million and  24 million Ms  Harris recently rolled out a plan to give every teacher in America a substantial raise  and her campaign said on Monday that she has received 11 000 donations from educators  

WASHINGTON   Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised  18 2 million over the first six weeks of his presidential bid  his campaign announced Tuesday  a display of financial strength that cements his status as one of the top fund raisers in the sprawling Democratic field Mr  Sanders received almost 900 000 contributions from 525 000 individual donors  his campaign manager  Faiz Shakir  said  The average donation was  20  compared with  27 in Mr  Sanders s 2016 presidential campaign  he said Mr  Shakir said that a majority of Mr  Sanders s donors were under the age of 39  and that 20 percent of all donors had not contributed to Mr  Sanders s previous campaigns  He said that 88 percent of the total money raised came from donors giving  200 or less Mr  Sanders s announcement of his fund raising for the first quarter of the year had been highly anticipated  as he was expected to reveal a sizable total  Presidential candidates must report their first quarter fund raising to the Federal Election Commission by April 15  but they can choose to disclose information before that deadline  The announcement on Tuesday offered a chance for Mr  Sanders s team to showcase the breadth of support for his campaign  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  His total for the quarter is the largest announced by a Democratic candidate so far  though most campaigns have not made their numbers public Senator Kamala Harris of California raised  12 million in the first quarter  her campaign said on Monday  Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   said on Monday that he had raised more than  7 million  Both candidates entered the race in January  several weeks before Mr  Sanders announced his candidacy Andrew Yang  a New York businessman who is running on a platform that the United States should provide a universal basic income  said Tuesday that he had raised more than  1 7 million from over 80 000 donors   noteworthy figures for a political newcomer  His average donation was  17 92  he said  an amount even smaller than Mr  Sanders s Former Representative Beto O Rourke of Texas  who entered the race in March and has been a prolific online fund raiser  has yet to announce his haul for the quarter The fund raising totals are important beyond the symbolic value they carry for candidates who can point to large numbers of supporters  The Iowa caucuses are still 10 months away  meaning that Democratic candidates will need to be able to fund their campaigns for a long stretch of time just to make it to the first nominating contest  Who s in  Who s out  Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker   There is zero question now that Bernie will be able to build a very strong and formidable campaign operation   said Mo Elleithee  who was a spokesman for Hillary Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign and is now the executive director of Georgetown University s Institute of Politics and Public Service But Mr  Elleithee said it remained to be seen whether Mr  Sanders s backers would stick with him as time went on   What will be interesting is  Is this sustainable as other candidates get better known   he said Mr  Sanders posted a bigger opening number than he did in the last presidential race  when he raised about  14 million in the quarter that covered April through June of 2015  Mr  Shakir said it took 146 days  or about 21 weeks  for Mr  Sanders to reach 900 000 donations in that campaign But the amount raised by Mr  Sanders this quarter was not off the charts for a Democratic presidential hopeful  Mrs  Clinton raised about  47 million in her first quarter as a candidate in the 2016 campaign  though unlike Mr  Sanders  she relied heavily on big donations Mr  Sanders began the 2020 race with the benefit of an enormous donor base that he developed in his primary campaign against Mrs  Clinton  when he raised well over  200 million  After jumping into the 2020 race on Feb  19  he quickly reminded his rivals of his large following  collecting  5 9 million in the first 24 hours and a total of  10 million within a week   Only Mr  O Rourke disclosed a bigger 24 hour haul  with  6 1 million  The Sanders campaign had set a goal of receiving one million donations by the end of the first quarter  The campaign fell short of that goal  but Mr  Shakir expressed no regret about having aimed for it   It was important to us to set an ambitious goal   he said Mr  Sanders s financial resources go beyond the money he has received since entering the presidential race  Like others running for president who have previously run for federal office  he can make use of funds that he had raised in earlier campaigns  He began the 2020 race with  14 million available for his use  Mr  Shakir said Mr  Shakir said the new fund raising total showed that the movement Mr  Sanders began in his 2016 campaign was still gaining steam  He noted that there had been questions from pundits about whether that would be the case   Is this movement sustaining  Is it still there   The answer is a resounding yes   he said   It is still strong and it is still growing

WASHINGTON   Tricia Newbold  the Trump administration s latest whistle blower  did something unexpected only hours after a House committee released her deposition that the White House had overruled career staff members who denied officials their security clearances  She went back to work  As you can imagine   Ms  Newbold  a 39 year old employee of the White House Personnel Security Office  wrote in an email during her commute on Monday   I am extremely nervous for how people at work will treat me  But according to people close to her  she was not afraid to tell them about the things she had seen  Ms  Newbold s decision to accuse her own office of rampant mismanagement of the security clearances of at least 25 employees came after months of what she characterized as personal discrimination and professional retaliation from Carl Kline  the office s former director  after she spent roughly a year trying to raise issues internally In a White House where aggressive leak investigations are conducted in service of President Trump  who has aides sign nondisclosure agreements  Ms  Newbold s account represents the rarest of developments  a damning on the record account from a current employee inside his ranks  She wasn t looking for trouble   Ms  Newbold s lawyer  Edward Passman  said in an interview on Monday   And she wasn t looking to go public  But her back was to the wall and she did what she had to do  Described as both  no nonsense  and  intense  by people who have interacted with her during the clearance process  Ms  Newbold has served under four presidential administrations  beginning with the Clinton White House in 2000  Eventually she worked her way up to adjudications manager  a job that required her to help make determinations about the security clearances of administration employees  Her office is filled with holdovers from other administrations  and it is meant to be nonpartisan Yet in the Trump administration the office was filled with people who had little experience in vetting employees in the interest of national security  Ms  Newbold said in a nine hour deposition with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform last week  There was no resolution   Ms  Newbold told the committee  according to a lengthy summary letter the panel s Democratic chairman published of her interview  which contained verbatim quotes   And I feel that right now this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office  Ms  Newbold told the committee that at least two senior administration officials had been granted security clearances   which gave them access to classified information   despite possible disqualifying issues  She also told the committee that she had compiled a list of at least 25 individuals  including contractors and senior advisers  who had a  wide range  of disqualifying information  including drug use  financial problems and criminal conduct In February  The New York Times reported that the president overruled several senior officials in order to reinstate the security clearance of Jared Kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  despite issues raised during his clearance process John F  Kelly  the president s former chief of staff  wrote a contemporaneous internal memo about how he had been  ordered  to give Mr  Kushner the top secret clearance  In her interviews with the House committee  Ms  Newbold said that Mr  Kelly and Joe Hagin  the former deputy chief of staff  had been attentive to the national security issues she had tried to raise Mr  Hagin resigned last June and Mr  Kelly in December  Mr  Trump has the legal authority to grant a clearance  but in most cases  the Personnel Security Office makes a determination about whether to grant one after the F B I  has conducted a background check Democrats on the committee are also demanding information from the White House about Ivanka Trump  the president s eldest daughter and adviser  who was granted a security clearance shortly after Mr  Kushner got his  In an interview with ABC News in February  Ms  Trump insisted her father had no hand in either her clearance or her husband s Ms  Newbold  who has a rare form of dwarfism  also accused Mr  Kline  the former director of personnel security  of retaliating against her when she repeatedly pointed out to him that actions he was taking  including overriding recommendations to issue clearances to two senior officials  were violating protocol  Ms  Newbold said that Mr  Kline oversaw a workplace where files   including extensive and sensitive background check documents   were not secured properly  and stopped the performing of credit checks for potential employees  She told the House committee that she had  never seen our office so ill staffed and with such lack of experience  Last fall  Ms  Newbold filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  accusing Mr  Kline of moving office files to a shelf several feet above her  deliberately out of her reach  beginning in December 2017  That month  she hired Mr  Passman  her lawyer  As little as I am  I m willing to fight and stand up for what I know is right  and they ve always respected that about me   Ms  Newbold told the House committee last week   It s humiliating to not be able to independently work and do the job that you need  In January  Ms  Newbold was suspended for two weeks without pay after NBC News reported that Mr  Kline had approved a security clearance for Mr  Kushner despite staff objections  The office s new director  Crede Bailey  said at the time that Ms  Newbold had refused to  support new procedures your supervisor implemented  Within the past two weeks  Mr  Passman said she was also removed from her supervisory role at work  On Monday  the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether she could expect to continue in her job  In the evening  Ms  Newbold s lawyer said she had gone back to work without incident Also on Monday  Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the committee s chairman  called for a subpoena for Mr  Kline  who now works at the Defense Department  to learn more about his work when he was the director of the office and about his interactions with Ms  Newbold  In a letter to Pat Cipollone  the White House counsel  Mr  Cummings said that the Trump administration had refused to provide information about  the problematic practices of the White House Security Office over the past two years  Republicans on the committee quickly sought to minimize what Ms  Newbold actually knew about the senior officials whose clearances were overturned  In a memo released on Monday  they said Mr  Cummings used only  cherry picked excerpts  from Ms  Newbold s deposition  and said she had acknowledged that the president had the  authority to grant access to national security information to anyone he chooses   The Republican members also pointed out that she had positive things to say about Mr  Bailey  her current supervisor Mr  Passman said Mr  Bailey s two week suspension of Ms  Newbold was  unwarranted   but added that  he s not personally attacking her like Kline did  It did not surprise Mr  Passman or other people close to Ms  Newbold that she returned to work   her choice to continue  kind of speaks for itself  about the kind of person she is  her older sister  Melissa Rahming  said in an interview on Monday   She s not afraid for what she s said   Ms  Rahming said  adding that her sister had  held her integrity this entire time  Daniel Jacobson  a former associate counsel in the Obama White House  called Ms  Newbold a  serious security professional  and a  total straight shooter  in a tweet on Monday  

WASHINGTON   A newly filed lawsuit is challenging a censorship system the government uses to ensure that millions of former military and intelligence officials spill no secrets if they decide to write articles and books after they move on from public service In an unusual constitutional complaint filed on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Maryland  a group of former officials declared that the prepublication review system  to which they are required to submit writing that relates to their former work for the rest of their lives  is  dysfunctional  and unjustifiably restricts their free speech and due process rights The system is plagued by a patchwork of ambiguous policies and vague standards that puts too much discretionary power in the hands of reviewing officials  who can delay or discriminate against lower ranking people who criticize government actions  while speedily clearing favorable memoirs and other writings by retired senior officials  the lawsuit said  This far reaching censorship system simply can t be squared with the Constitution   said Jameel Jaffer  executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University  which is jointly representing the plaintiffs with the American Civil Liberties Union He added   The government has a legitimate interest in protecting bona fide national security secrets  but this system sweeps too broadly  fails to limit the discretion of government censors and suppresses political speech that is vital to informing public debate  The Justice Department declined to comment about the lawsuit filed Tuesday  Read the complaint  The review system traces back to limits imposed on a handful of C I A  officials in the 1950s  It ratcheted out to cover more and more people and agencies starting in the 1970s and ballooned further under the Reagan administration Consenting to the reviews is now a routine part of gaining a security clearance  and the lawsuit also complained that even military employees without access to classified information face similar lifelong constraints While many lawsuits have been filed over the government s handling of particular manuscripts  the new one appears to be the first to challenge the underlying system itself  unconnected to any particular disputed piece of writing  legal specialists said The system relies mainly on a 1980 Supreme Court ruling  Snepp v  United States  which permitted the C I A  to seize the proceeds from a former officer who published a book without submitting it to the agency for review  The court did not hear arguments or take briefs before issuing an unsigned ruling  which dismissed the First Amendment issues in a footnote The legality of the censorship system is  unsettled  in part because  the practice of prior restraint by the government has grown enormously  since that case was decided  said Jack Goldsmith  a Harvard Law School professor and former Bush administration Justice Department official who has co written several articles critical of the process At the C I A  alone  the agency went from reviewing about 1 000 pages a year in the early 1970s to about 150 000 in 2014  the lawsuit said  citing documents the A C L U  and Knight Institute obtained under the Freedom of Information Act  This is a huge problem   Mr  Goldsmith said   The government s system of prior restraint is wildly overbroad  undisciplined and subject to inconsistent standards  It results in lots of important information that doesn t threaten national security not being made public  It chills people from writing things that would help people understand how the government works  In 2017  as part of the annual intelligence authorization law  Congress instructed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to come up with a new system for the intelligence community that would  yield timely  reasoned  and impartial decisions that are subject to appeal   Lawmakers set a deadline of 180 days But that deadline came and went  and the office still has not completed a new policy  although officials are working on it  an office spokeswoman said on Monday The plaintiffs asked a judge to rule that agencies cannot enforce any obligation to submit their future writings to review boards  They took no position on whether the solution is to fix the system or make it voluntary   which would leave former intelligence and military officials and contractors free to publish without prior review if they assume the risk of being prosecuted if they divulge any dangerous secrets The plaintiffs include Timothy H  Edgar and Richard H  Immerman  former employees of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  Melvin A  Goodman  a former C I A  employee  Anuradha Bhagwati  a former Marine  and Mark Fallon  a former counterterrorism agent at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service Mr  Fallon  who retired in 2010  said that he had trouble getting the manuscript for his book   Unjustifiable Means  The Inside Story of How the C I A   Pentagon  and U S  Government Conspired to Torture   cleared for publication His plan  he said  had been to publish it at the start of the Trump administration  But the government farmed out his book to numerous agencies  and the review process delayed publication more than eight months  to the fall of 2017  disrupting promotional plans When the manuscript was finally returned to him  he said  censors demanded the removal of 113 passages  many of which cited names and events that had been discussed in congressional hearings or newspaper articles  He said he reluctantly consented rather than delay further  There are names redacted in my book that are part of the Congressional Record   Mr  Fallon said   There are names that are redacted in parts of my book that weren t redacted in other parts of my book  which shows how ludicrous the process was  He also maintained that books by former officials and contractors who defended the C I A  s interrogation program were treated better  including George Tenet  its former director  John Rizzo  its former acting general counsel  Jose Rodriguez  the former head of its Counterterrorism Center  and psychologist James Mitchell  who helped design its program That critique dovetails with another recently filed lawsuit related to the prepublication censorship in 2011 of a book by Ali Soufan  a former F B I  counterterrorism agent who had clashed with the C I A  over the agency s use of torture after the Sept  11 attacks The lawsuit was brought by documentary filmmakers who say Mr  Soufan is still unable to discuss material with them that agency censors had blacked out in his manuscript  even though the C I A  permitted the former agency officials to discuss similar things in their own books   like details about the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah  a high value terrorism suspect  The system was about controlling a narrative   Mr  Soufan said in an interview   I had self censored a lot   I know what is classified   but it s not about protecting sources and methods if I m allowed to say  Abu Zubaydah talked because of waterboarding   but if I want to say  it wasn t waterboarding  that s not what happened   I can t say it   

WASHINGTON   Former Representative Beto O Rourke of Texas raised  9 4 million over the first 18 days of his presidential bid  his campaign said on Wednesday  the latest sign of his ability to attract online donors even within a packed Democratic field The total  which represents Mr  O Rourke s fund raising haul for the first quarter of the year  is smaller than the first quarter numbers of two rivals  Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California  But Mr  O Rourke only joined the presidential race in mid March Mr  O Rourke  who proved to be an extraordinary online fund raiser during his unsuccessful run for Senate last year  received 218 000 contributions  with an average donation of  43  his campaign said It also said that a majority of donors to his presidential bid had not donated to his Senate campaign  Mr  O Rourke raised roughly  80 million for his race against Senator Ted Cruz  an eye popping total that created high expectations for his fund raising as a presidential candidate  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  After entering the 2020 race  Mr  O Rourke offered early evidence of his fund raising power  His campaign said he had received  6 1 million in the first 24 hours of his bid  more than any other Democratic presidential candidate had announced raising in his or her first day  Mr  Sanders had previously been atop the pack  at  5 9 million in 24 hours That huge first day made up a majority of Mr  O Rourke s fund raising in the first quarter  Mr  Sanders went on to reach a total of  10 million raised within a week of announcing his campaign  his team said  a threshold that Mr  O Rourke did not meet in 18 days  There are tremendous expectations for him given his 2018 performance  but he s now swimming in a much more crowded pond than he was in 2018   said Amy Walter  the national editor of the Cook Political Report   And so I think that is going to be something to be watching for over the course of these next few months   Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker  Mr  O Rourke s campaign said 98 percent of the contributions it received were below  200  The campaign did not say how much cash it currently has  Not only is this a sign of our grass roots strength during the first two weeks of our campaign   Mr  O Rourke said of his fund raising in a statement   but it is a sign of what s possible when you put your full trust in the people of this country  Presidential candidates must disclose their first quarter fund raising by April 15  but some campaigns decide to make their numbers public before that deadline Mr  Sanders s campaign said on Tuesday that he had raised  18 2 million over six weeks  and Ms  Harris s campaign said on Monday that she had raised  12 million since joining the race in January  Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   said on Monday that he had raised more than  7 million since January The early fund raising totals put Mr  Sanders and Mr  O Rourke in their own class when it comes to bringing in money from grass roots donors  Mr  Sanders s campaign said he had not held any fund raising events  Mr  O Rourke s campaign said 99 percent of his fund raising came from online donations  and that he had not held a fund raiser since entering the race Ms  Harris  on the other hand  has a strong network of small donors  but she has also aggressively courted large donors  Her campaign said more than  6 million of her  12 million total came from the campaign s digital program  which includes fund raising efforts like email solicitations  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is  fully behind  Stephen Moore  his choice to help lead the Federal Reserve  despite unflattering details that have come to light about Moore s personal life  a top White House official said Wednesday while also complaining about Washington s  toxic  environment  I spoke to the president yesterday  He completely supports Steve  I certainly do  People are being awful hard on him     This town is a toxic town in some respects   Larry Kudlow  director of the National Economic Council  told reporters   So we are fully behind him  fully behind him  Kudlow said Moore is  a smart guy  who  would be a breath of fresh air on the Fed  and so far it s all systems go  Moore is a former Trump campaign adviser who helped design massive tax cuts the president signed into law in 2017  He has been affiliated with multiple conservative groups  including as the Heritage Foundation s chief economist  leading some economists to say Moore could inject politics into an institution that strives to keep decisions about monetary policy free of political influence Moore has taken a series of controversial stances on the Fed  and has acknowledged the need to learn more about how the central bank works He also has said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell should be fired for rate hikes last year that Moore claims undermined the benefits from Trump s tax cuts  Trump has also publicly come down hard on Powell over those increases  The Fed recently announced it will not raise interest rates in 2019  a decision Powell said was not influenced by the president Trump has yet to forward Moore s nomination to serve on the Fed s Board of Governors to the Senate for confirmation  His required background check has yet to be completed According to published reports and court records  Moore had a lien of more than  75 000 filed against him in January 2018 for unpaid taxes  and has fallen behind on alimony and child support payments to his ex wife After Trump s announcement in March  Moore said his criticisms of the Fed  including his suggestion about dismissing Powell  were likely written  in a time of anger  While the Fed s recent actions have been more in line with the easy credit stance the administration is seeking  Trump has made sharp attacks on the central bank at recent meetings  according to a report Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal  The newspaper quoted an unnamed source present at one of the meetings as saying that Trump told the group that he told Powell during a recent telephone conversation   I guess I m stuck with you  Asked about that comment during his appearance at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor  Kudlow said he thought it was an  expression of love and affection  on the part of the president Under the law that governs the Federal Reserve  a president can only remove a Fed chairman for cause  Courts in cases that involved other agencies that use similar language have interpreted it to exclude policy differences On the separate issue of tariffs  Kudlow said Trump would veto legislation being considered by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley  R Iowa  that  among other things  would scale back the president s virtually unlimited power to impose tariffs on imports he declares a threat to national security  The president is not in favor of that at the moment  Not in favor of that   Kudlow said  He added that the president believes imposing tariffs  or even merely threatening to impose them  gives him the upper hand in trade talks with other countries  China most notably Trump slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports last year and believes China would not currently be negotiating a trade deal with the U S  had he not imposed the levies  Kudlow said A Chinese delegation is in Washington this week for another round of talks  following a U S  team s trip to Beijing last week for discussions    AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report     

WASHINGTON   Some of Robert S  Mueller III s investigators have told associates that Attorney General William P  Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr  Barr indicated  according to government officials and others familiar with their simmering frustrations At stake in the dispute   the first evidence of tension between Mr  Barr and the special counsel s office   is who shapes the public s initial understanding of one of the most consequential government investigations in American history  Some members of Mr  Mueller s team are concerned that  because Mr  Barr created the first narrative of the special counsel s findings  Americans  views will have hardened before the investigation s conclusions become public Mr  Barr has said he will move quickly to release the nearly 400 page report but needs time to scrub out confidential information  The special counsel s investigators had already written multiple summaries of the report  and some team members believe that Mr  Barr should have included more of their material in the four page letter he wrote on March 24 laying out their main conclusions  according to government officials familiar with the investigation  Mr  Barr only briefly cited the special counsel s work in his letter ImageListen to  The Daily   New Insights Into the Mueller ReportThe attorney general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four page summary  Members of the special counsel s team say something was lost transcriptBack to The Dailybars0 00 25 58 25 58transcriptListen to  The Daily   New Insights Into the Mueller ReportHosted by Michael Barbaro  produced by Theo Balcomb  Lisa Tobin and Paige Cowett  and edited by Larissa AndersonThe attorney general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four page summary  Members of the special counsel s team say something was lost michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  The Mueller team sent its report to the attorney general  William Barr  The attorney general sent a summary of that report to Congress  Now  new reporting shows members of Mueller s team feel that Barr s summary did not reflect the report they wrote  It s Thursday  April 4  So take us back to the beginning of last week  What do we know at that point nicholas fandosSo we knew that Bill Barr  taking Bob Mueller s 300  to 400 page report  had gone through it extensively and boiled down what he called the  principal conclusions  to just four pages michael barbaroNick Fandos covers Congress  Mike Schmidt covers national security michael schmidtWe were in this unusual situation where the special counsel  Robert Mueller  had sent his report to the attorney general  said  I found no evidence that the campaign conspired with Russia to impact the election  But he declined to make a decision on obstruction nicholas fandosAnd what he said was Mueller didn t reach what Barr called a  traditional prosecutorial decision   In other words  Mueller presented evidence for the fact that the president may have obstructed justice but didn t go as far as to conclude that he had  He essentially punted to the attorney general s office michael schmidtAnd in this case  by Mueller not reaching a determination  he leaves the door open for Barr to come in to say  O K   Mueller didn t make a determination on this issue of obstruction  He did on collusion  I m going to look at all the facts  And he makes his determination   no case to be made here on both of these issues  The problem  though  is that the perception is that Mueller  the independent investigator who s there to do an inquiry free of politics  has not made a call on this central question  But Barr  the president s appointee  who s been there just for a few months  is making the decision  So the question is  is the fix in  Why is it  if Mueller didn t come to an answer  the attorney general did michael barbaroSo at the beginning of last week  we know that Mueller made the unusual decision not to make a call  And Barr made the unusual decision to make a call  And the question is  why michael schmidtIt s not unusual that Barr made a call  The Justice Department is there to decide whether people broke the law or not  And he was doing that  What s different and unusual here is that Barr and Mueller don t look like they re on the same page  music michael schmidtMueller said  I can t make a determination on this issue  And Barr did  So why is it that they looked at it differently  Why was it that Mueller  the prosecutor here  didn t do the one thing that prosecutors at the Justice Department do  which is make a call nicholas fandosAnd that was the question that we ve spent the last week trying to figure out  What is the difference here  What is the evidence that they re looking at  And why did Mueller and Barr make the decisions that they made around this question of obstruction of justice michael barbaroAnd what have we now learned nicholas fandosWhat we ve now learned is that nobody s happy  The team that was working   or at least some of the team that was working with Bob Mueller feels that Barr stepped in and filled the vacuum in a way that didn t properly capture what their 22 month investigation found  And Barr s team feels that Bob Mueller fell short of doing his job michael barbaroSo let s start with the Barr side  Explain more about why the attorney general and those around him are upset michael schmidtSo in not reaching a decision on obstruction of justice  Barr has to go out on his own and make that determination without the top cover of the independent investigator who went out and was supposed to make a determination on whether the president broke the law michael barbaroAnd what do you mean by  top cover  michael schmidtOne of the reasons you have a special counsel is to insulate an investigation from politics and then  when the investigation is concluded  have a way of holding up the product of the inquiry  the fruits of it  to the public and saying  look  this was done free of politics  We assessed this matter based on the facts  And now you have a result that is exposed  at least in part  to the perception that the president s guy made the decision michael barbaroThe attorney general michael schmidtCorrect nicholas fandosUndercutting one of the key points of Mueller s appointment in the first place michael barbaroAnd you re saying that the people in the Justice Department and that Barr himself are upset to be put in that position michael schmidtWell  the system s not working the way it s supposed to  You had Mueller there for one reason   yea or nay on crimes  And on one of these central questions  he couldn t get there  And by stepping back and saying  I don t know  it allows at least the Democrats to say  what  How was this decision made  How did they get to this  How is it that the president s political appointee was the ultimate decider nicholas fandosAnd it gives them real credence to go and say  we need to see all the evidence  We need to see the whole file here because the president s handpicked man made this decision  Maybe we d reach a different conclusion if we looked at the evidence  Bob Mueller seems to have michael barbaroSo then why did Barr choose to make a call on obstruction of justice if he knew and was upset that this was going to be seen as hyper political and that it would fan the flames of Democrats in Congress nicholas fandosThe problem for Barr was that when he got the report and looked at the evidence  to him  it was a pretty clear case that you would not press this kind of charge  that the president hadn t obstructed justice  Now  you ve got to remember that Barr comes to the job with a pretty expansive view of executive power  As Democrats made famous  he wrote a memo before he was appointed attorney general arguing that certain acts by the president shouldn t be construed as obstruction of justice  They re part of his executive powers  And so he looked at this and  I mean  he can t make the same decision that Mueller did  Somebody has to make a choice about whether or not this is a chargeable offense  And he looked at it and says  well  in our judgment and this team s judgment  it s not michael barbaroSo Barr reads the report and thinks  what are you talking about it s not clear whether or not there was obstruction of justice  There  in his mind  clearly wasn t nicholas fandosBarr does acknowledge that there is evidence  basically  of behavior that could be construed as obstructive  He gives credence to what Mueller is presenting but says  when you add it all up  it doesn t tip into  michael schmidtCriminality nicholas fandos  criminal obstructive territory michael barbaroRight  And while it felt political for Barr to reach a conclusion  to make a call that Mueller wouldn t  I have to think it would have felt even more political in Barr s mind for Congress to be the one to perform that role  And so he was upset to have to make this call  but  it sounds like  felt that he had to michael schmidtI don t know if he s upset as much as he looks at this situation and says  this is not the way it s supposed to be working  Someone needs to make a decision on whether the president broke the law  I ll step in and do that  And I think I can do that based on the facts nicholas fandosAnd Congress can still play a role  I m redacting the report  I ll give it to you with sensitive information blacked out  And then you can make your own judgment  But the public has an intense interest in this  And I ve got to say something  And I decide whether acts broke the law or not  And I don t think this one did michael barbaroDo we know if Mueller s team expected Barr to make this call on obstruction of justice after they declined to do so nicholas fandosWe don t know precisely what the Mueller team expected on this obstruction question  It seems that they were not clear in communicating to the Justice Department what they wanted  It may not have mattered anyway  But what we do know is that after Barr came out with this four page summary  which essentially exonerated the president on collusion and said he did not break the law on obstruction  some members of Mr  Mueller s team felt that he had inadequately and only partially represented the work of their 22 month investigation michael barbaroSo this is the other side of your reporting   that not only was the Barr side disappointed with the Mueller side  the Mueller side was disappointed with the Barr side nicholas fandosWhat we have learned is that since Barr made his public statement about a week ago  members of the Mueller team have told associates that they feel  essentially  that his work   if it wasn t misrepresentative of theirs   didn t give the full picture  which they believe is more damaging to the president than the attorney general s letter lets on  Now  we are not saying that every member of the Mueller team is frustrated by this  We don t know what Bob Mueller himself thinks  He remains one of the black boxes at the center of this investigation  But there are members of the team who were involved in the decision making around these issues that we ve been talking about who have watched and been disappointed and angry about how it s being characterized michael barbaroAnd what is the focus of their disappointment  to the degree you understand it nicholas fandosSo when they read Bill Barr s concise four page letter  they were frustrated that he had not drawn more from their own work  And in fact  what we discovered in reporting this piece out is that they had prepared summaries of their own work that were part of the report that they handed over to the Justice Department a couple of weeks ago and felt that some of that material could have easily been drawn into what Mr  Barr handed over  So not that he shouldn t have made a decision about whether the president obstructed justice or not in a criminal sense  but that concurrent with that  he should have put out more of their evidence or analysis to fill out the public picture  The Justice Department says those summaries had sensitive information in them  classified information  secretive grand jury information that couldn t become public  and ultimately didn t use any of it michael schmidtSo what Mueller s folks are essentially saying is  hey  we wrote these summaries  If you were going to go out and say something about this investigation  and you were going to do something as extreme or as declarative as clearing the president  why is it that you didn t include some of the things that we found michael barbaroAnd specifically  why didn t you include some stuff that we found that was pretty damning  You re making it seem like the president didn t do anything wrong michael schmidtDonald Trump has come out in the days after Barr s declaration and said the Mueller report was beautiful  And it completely exonerates him  If you re an investigator who spent the last two years looking at Donald Trump  and you think there s a lot of questionable behavior there  that is something that is going to irritate you mightily michael barbaroI mean  do either of you think that the Mueller people have a legitimate point here  Or is this a classic case of pride of authorship  They wanted to see their work in the public summary nicholas fandosI don t think that we fully know  What seems clear in our reporting is that there was no specific communication or agreement by the Mueller team to the Barr team   you should use these things  or we want these things to be out  They seem to have had an intention  And they certainly now have a regret about it  But we don t know what interaction there was in the actual decision making process that happened that weekend two weeks ago michael barbaroWell  so why do we think that Barr chose not to include more of what was in these summaries  especially the negative material  in his four page summary michael schmidtI think there s one big  broad reason and another contemporary reason  the broad reason being that Barr and many Justice Department officials and  for many years  prosecutors believe that if they decide not to charge someone  the fruits of the investigation should not be just thrown out there for the public or for the enemies of the person who were investigated michael barbaroDirty laundry should not be aired if the subject of those dirty laundry are not charged with a crime michael schmidtIf you cannot meet this incredibly high bar of bringing a federal prosecution  that doesn t mean you then get to just take the trash and just throw it out in the street and let the public rummage through it michael barbaroAnd Mike  by the contemporary example you referred to  I m assuming you re talking about James Comey michael schmidtI m talking about the July 2016 press conference that James Comey held  It s right in the heat of the presidential election  He stands up and says  we  the F B I   have done this investigation into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email account  We don t think there is a case to be made here  But we found some very questionable behavior in how she handled sensitive national security secrets  The press conference was seen as very damaging to Clinton even though a case was never made michael barbaroAnd so you re saying that Barr s view would be  I m not going to be the one to replicate that by drawing from these Mueller team summaries and putting those out into the public sphere michael schmidtCorrect  We don t use criminal investigations to go out and find damaging things that may not be crimes that we then simply release to the public to be used against someone nicholas fandosThe problem is  this was never a normal or average criminal investigation  It has broad national security implications  And it has implications for almost every decision that s made at the highest levels of the government michael schmidtThis is more about a pathway of how you deal with the president s conduct  And what it appears from the Mueller side is that they re saying  look  this is the president of the United States  There s some conduct here that we think the public and Congress should see  And O K   Justice Department  it may not be criminal  But this is the president  And this needs to be examined more thoroughly by the political process and by Congress  It s about a pathway of dealing with the president nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr doesn t seem to disagree with that  fundamentally  He said throughout that he wants to make as much of this report public as possible  But he doesn t think that that absolves him of the Justice Department s role of saying whether or not the president or his campaign broke the law  And so he s grappling with the Justice Department s aversion to talk about individuals that it s not saying broke the law  But yet he knows that the public and the Congress want and probably are owed more information about what did happen  And so he s kind of operating somewhere in the middle of those two things michael schmidtThe difference here is that if I was under investigation  and the Justice Department determined that I didn t break the law  then there s no other process that really needs to be dealt with me  Maybe my company needs to decide whether I get fired or not for that conduct  In this instance  there s another issue with the president  O K   the president didn t break the law  But maybe the president did things with his power that the public should know about  Congress should know about  and need to be more closely examined  Because maybe it s not just about breaking the law  It s about how he conducted himself as president  And does Congress need to deal with that  And what we are starting to see from Mueller s side is this frustration that  hey  we think there s some bad stuff that happened here  But by Barr coming out and not disclosing that but saying the president didn t break the law  he is casting the die on how the public will later look at the president s conduct  It will say that for several weeks after we finished our report  the only thing that was out there was Bill Barr saying the president didn t break the law  and the president turning around and saying  I was fully exonerated  And they re saying  hey  America  we think more of this process needs to play out michael barbaroRight michael schmidtSo this all comes down to the vexing question of  how do we investigate a sitting president  And how is that done in a way that the public has the utmost confidence in that  And in that is this tension between how much independence the investigator should have  In Nixon  that pendulum swung too far in the president s direction  In the Starr investigation of Clinton  it went the other way  The investigator had too much power  And here  between Mueller and Barr s teams  they are fighting that same fight and have different understandings of how this should all be dealt with  And it s the same issue that we ve been looking at for 50 years  just the latest episode of it michael barbaroSo inside of one presidential investigation  these two teams are embodying all the tensions that have basically been present since Watergate nicholas fandosCorrect michael schmidtIt s how much you can tell the public  and how is apparent misconduct by the president dealt with  And there s no clear pathway on that  So whatever Barr does will be viewed by one side as political and laying on the brakes for the president  Whatever Mueller does will be viewed by the president s enemies as trying to get him  And the confidence in that process then erodes  And it s messy  And it s hard to figure out  What are the real facts here  What really happened michael barbaroBut at this point  we re just talking about the summary that Bill Barr sent to Congress  We re still waiting on the full report  So won t this tension that you re describing eventually be more or less resolved when we learn how much information we ll ultimately have access to nicholas fandosIt may be  And we may see a very different set of facts at the end of the day  But I think the question here is about who sets the narrative for the intervening period of time  It may end up being a month before we see a fuller version of the Mueller report  And for that time  Bill Barr s conclusion that the president didn t break the law is going to be the dominant narrative  And I think that what we re hearing from members of the Mueller team is a concern that by the time their fuller work does come out  the narrative is baked   so much so that even if it shows  for instance  that the president didn t break the law but abused his office or conducted acts that Congress will deem inappropriate for his office  that there s not room to have a full debate around that  that the conclusions about the work that they did for 22 months will have been prejudged at that point  and that it won t quite matter what the report says for the president s political fate michael barbaroNick  Mike  thank you very much nicholas fandosThank you guys michael schmidtThanks for having us archived recording  jerry nadler The committee has a job to do  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct michael barbaroOn Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the use of subpoenas to obtain a full copy of the Mueller report archived recording  jerry nadler That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence michael barbaroThe committee s chairman  Democratic representative Jerry Nadler of New York  said he would not immediately issue a subpoena  But his power to do so will intensify pressure on the attorney general  William Barr  to quickly release an unredacted copy of the report archived recording  jerry nadler I will give him time to change his mind  But if we cannot reach an accommodation  then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials michael barbaroWe ll be right back  music michael barbaroHere s what else you need to know today  A Times analysis of deadly terror attacks involving white extremists has found that at least a third of them were inspired by fellow white men who carried out similar attacks and had either professed admiration for them or interest in their tactics  In one case  a school shooter in New Mexico corresponded with a gunman who attacked a mall in Munich  All together  the two men killed 11 people  The connections between the killers crossed continents and highlight how the internet and social media have spread white extremism  And  archived recording  joe biden I ve always tried to be   in my career  I ve always tried to make a human connection  That s my responsibility  I think  I shake hands  I hug people  I grab men and women by the shoulders and say  you can do this michael barbaroOn Wednesday  former vice president Joe Biden responded to a series of complaints from women that his close physical contact had made them uncomfortable archived recording  joe biden Our social norms have begun to change  They ve shifted  And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset  And I get it  I get it  I hear what they re saying  I understand it michael barbaroIn a video message sent as Biden prepares for a possible presidential run  he defended his behavior but said he is able to change archived recording  joe biden But I ll always believe governing  quite frankly   life  for that matter   is about connecting michael barbaroThat s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow However  the special counsel s office never asked Mr  Barr to release the summaries soon after he received the report  a person familiar with the investigation said  And the Justice Department quickly determined that the summaries contain sensitive information  like classified material  secret grand jury testimony and information related to current federal investigations that must remain confidential  according to two government officials The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III Mr  Barr was also wary of departing from Justice Department practice not to disclose derogatory details in closing an investigation  according to two government officials familiar with Mr  Barr s thinking  They pointed to the decision by James B  Comey  the former F B I  director  to harshly criticize Hillary Clinton in 2016 while announcing that he was recommending no charges in the inquiry into her email practices The officials and others interviewed declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Mr  Barr explained  although the report is believed to examine Mr  Trump s efforts to thwart the investigation  It was unclear how much discussion Mr  Mueller and his investigators had with senior Justice Department officials about how their findings would be made public  It was also unclear how widespread the vexation is among the special counsel team  which included 19 lawyers  about 40 F B I  agents and other personnel At the same time  Mr  Barr and his advisers have expressed their own frustrations about Mr  Mueller and his team  Mr  Barr and other Justice Department officials believe the special counsel s investigators fell short of their task by declining to decide whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed the inquiry  according to the two government officials  After Mr  Mueller made no judgment on the obstruction matter  Mr  Barr stepped in to declare that he himself had cleared Mr  Trump of wrongdoing Representatives for the Justice Department and the special counsel declined to comment on Wednesday on views inside both Mr  Mueller s office and the Justice Department  They pointed to departmental regulations requiring Mr  Mueller to file a confidential report to the attorney general detailing prosecution decisions and to Mr  Barr s separate vow to send a redacted version of that report to Congress  Under the regulations  Mr  Barr can publicly release as much of the document as he deems appropriate Read Attorney General William Barr s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter  by Attorney General William P  Barr  details the main findings of the special counsel s two year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election A debate over how the special counsel s conclusions are represented has played out in public as well as in recent weeks  with Democrats in Congress accusing Mr  Barr of intervening to color the outcome of the investigation in the president s favor In his letter to Congress outlining the report s chief conclusions  Mr  Barr said that Mr  Mueller found no conspiracy between Mr  Trump s campaign and Russia s 2016 election interference  While Mr  Mueller made no decision on his other main question  whether the president illegally obstructed the inquiry  he explicitly stopped short of exonerating Mr  Trump Mr  Mueller s decision to skip a prosecutorial judgment  leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime   Mr  Barr wrote  He and his deputy  Rod J  Rosenstein  decided that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that Mr  Trump had committed an obstruction offense Mr  Barr has come under criticism for sharing so little  But according to officials familiar with the attorney general s thinking  he and his aides limited the details they revealed because they were worried about wading into political territory  Mr  Barr and his advisers expressed concern that if they included derogatory information about Mr  Trump while clearing him  they would face a storm of criticism like what Mr  Comey endured in the Clinton investigation VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S  Mueller III s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started CreditCreditDoug Mills The New York TimesLegal experts attacked Mr  Comey at the time for violating Justice Department practice to keep confidential any negative information about anyone uncovered during investigations  The practice exists to keep from unfairly sullying people s reputations without giving them a chance to respond in court Mr  Rosenstein cited the handling of the Clinton case in a memo the White House used to rationalize Mr  Trump s firing of Mr  Comey Though it was not clear what findings the special counsel s investigators viewed as troubling for the president  Mr  Barr has suggested that Mr  Mueller may have found evidence of malfeasance in investigating possible obstruction of justice   The report sets out evidence on both sides of the question   Mr  Barr wrote in his March 24 letter Mr  Mueller examined Mr  Trump s attempts to maintain control over the investigation  including his firing of Mr  Comey and his attempt to oust Mr  Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to install a loyalist to oversee the inquiry Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation The fallout from Mr  Barr s letter outlining the Russia investigation s main findings overshadowed his intent to make public as much of the entire report as possible  a goal he has stressed since his confirmation hearing in January  He reiterated to lawmakers on Friday that he wanted both Congress and the public to read the report and said that the department would by mid April furnish a version with sensitive material blacked out  He offered to testify on Capitol Hill soon after turning over the report Mr  Barr  who took office in February  has shown flashes of frustration over how the unveiling of the investigation s findings has unfolded  In his follow up letter to lawmakers on Friday  he chafed at how the news media and some lawmakers had characterized his March 24 letter Mr  Barr and Mr  Mueller have been friends for 30 years  and Mr  Barr said during his confirmation hearing in January that he trusted Mr  Mueller to conduct an impartial investigation  He said he told Mr  Trump that Mr  Mueller was a  straight shooter who should be dealt with as such   Mr  Mueller served as the head of the Justice Department s criminal division when Mr  Barr was attorney general under George Bush  and their families are friends Mr  Barr s promises of transparency have done little to appease Democrats who control the House  The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to let its chairman use a subpoena to try to compel Mr  Barr to hand over a full copy of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence to Congress  The chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York  has not said when he will use the subpoena  but made clear on Wednesday that he did not trust Mr  Barr s characterization of what Mr  Mueller s team found  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct   Mr  Nadler said   That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence  Republicans  who have embraced Mr  Barr s letter clearing Mr  Trump  have accused the Democrats of trying to prolong the cloud over his presidency and urged them to move on Mr  Trump has fully embraced Mr  Barr s version of events  For days  he has pronounced the outcome of the investigation a  complete and total exoneration  and called for the Justice Department and his allies on Capitol Hill to investigate and hold accountable those responsible for opening the inquiry

doing  whether the president is popular  Evidence in the Trump era so far shows young people coming of age now are tilting left  Election data suggests that the youngest voters are supporting

BERLIN   Germany s most notorious far right politician  Björn Höcke  a man who has called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin  a monument of shame   was furious when he woke up one morning to find a section of the memorial built to scale outside his bedroom window It was November 2017  Mr  Höcke sued the artist who had secretly rented the neighboring property and prepared the stunt over many months  He tried to have him evicted  He even launched criminal proceedings against him  But to no avail  The rental lease is open ended And the replica of the Holocaust memorial remains But where civil and criminal proceedings have failed  a state prosecutor has stepped in  it emerged Wednesday  The prosecutor s office in Mr  Höcke s eastern home state  Thuringia  is investigating the artist  Philipp Ruch  on suspicion of  forming a criminal association   a legal provision known as Paragraph 129  which gives the state far reaching surveillance rights and is normally applied to criminal groups and suspected extremists The investigation  which was revealed in the answer to a routine parliamentary question  is now raising questions about whether the law is being leveraged by far right sympathizers to crack down on their opponents  Mr  Höcke s party  the far right Alternative for Germany  the country s third largest party in Parliament  is particularly strong in the former Communist East of the country  We have to ask the question  Is there a political intention that overlaid the judicial intention   said Steffen Dittes  the lawmaker of the Left Party who made the parliamentary request to see a list of all those who were being investigated under Paragraph 129 In the reply he was sent  there were a dozen investigations listed in two tables  In one table  designated for terrorist suspects  groups like the Islamic State and the Shabab came up repeatedly  the other table included a group of Holocaust deniers  far right and far left extremists   and then   a group of action artists   It sends a devastating political signal   Mr  Dittes said Mr  Dittes noted that the investigation of Mr  Ruch was opened in November 2017  a week after he had unveiled the replica memorial and just a couple of days after Mr  Höcke had publicly accused Mr  Ruch and his artist collective of being  a terrorist association  ImageBjörn Höcke  center  a member of the far right party Alternative for Germany  in Chemnitz last year CreditMartin Divisek EPA  via ShutterstockMr  Dittes also said that the prosecutor in charge of the investigation had built a reputation for being soft on far right offenders  for example letting it slide when a notorious German song about  a subway to Auschwitz  was sung at an Alternative for Germany election rally in 2017  This does not look like a mistake or an exception   Mr  Dittes said Martin Zschächner  the prosecutor in Thuringia in charge of the investigation  denied that it was politically motivated  Speaking in a telephone interview  Mr  Zschächner said he was investigating Mr  Ruch because he was suspected of illegally  spying  on Mr  Höcke  On their internet page they said they wanted to spy on him  so the question is whether that happened or was planned   Mr  Zschächner said  Sixteen months later  he said  the investigation was still continuing Meanwhile  the domestic intelligence service of Thuringia concluded long ago that neither Mr  Ruch nor his artist collective  the Berlin based Center for Political Beauty  was extremist   It s political art  not extremism   said Stephan Kramer  who heads the agency Mr  Ruch aims to offend  He has been sued countless times over his art  but so far he has never lost a case  And never before has anyone raised any suspicions of him being a criminal or involved in extremist activity  he said  That is the scary part   Mr  Ruch said in an interview on Wednesday   They could be observing me  tapping my phone  following me around because they don t like my art and my politics   He plans legal action against Mr  Zschächner The idea of making a replica memorial outside of Mr  Höcke s house came to Mr  Ruch in January 2017  That month  Mr  Höcke spoke at a rally in Dresden and questioned the guiding precept of modern Germany   the country s culpability in World War II and the Holocaust   calling on Germans to make a  180 degree  turn in the way they viewed their history Germans were  the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of their capital   he had said  referring to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin ImageA news conference last year with activists of the Center for Political Beauty  from left  Cesy Leonard  Stefan Pelzer and Philipp Ruch CreditBernd von Jutrczenka Picture Alliance  via Getty ImagesIn addition to building the replica memorial  Mr  Ruch and his colleagues pretended to monitor Mr  Höcke s family home from a fake spy room with old electronic equipment that was also open to visitors Sometimes  the artists would dress up as spies in trench coats and filmed Mr  Höcke s house  Once  they even rifled through his trash to get a DNA sample in order to determine Mr  Höcke s own racial purity   It turned out he has Polish and Portuguese ancestry  Another time  they offered 5 000 euros  or about  5 620  to anyone willing to provide a witness statement that Mr  Höcke has written under a pseudonym for a newsletter associated with a convicted neo Nazi who lives two villages away Mr  Ruch defended these measures as stunts aimed at raising awareness about how extremist Mr  Höcke s views were in his opinion Two years later  Germany s domestic intelligence office has in fact put Mr  Höcke and a number of other prominent members of the Alternative for Germany under observation for suspected extremism  What we did as fiction the state is now doing in reality   Mr  Ruch said Mr  Ruch has known since February that he was the subject of some investigation because a government sponsored organization that had invited him to speak at a conference abruptly disinvited him on Feb  12 In a letter  the organization said it had been informed by the Interior Ministry about a criminal investigation regarding his person Mr  Ruch himself had not been informed that he was under investigation  It was only when Mr  Dittes contacted him last month that he began to make enquiries  But when he requested to see his file  he was denied access  because the investigations are still ongoing   

WASHINGTON   Amid blowback from Capitol Hill  President Donald Trump switched gears again Wednesday  suggesting he never wanted Congress to vote to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election Trump s new tweets shifted his rationale for the  Obamacare  fight  First he said it was his choice to push off the health care votes  Then he said he never expected there to be any votes at all until after 2020 Trump claimed Wednesday he had never intended to reopen old wounds  But in keeping the issue at the forefront  the president put fresh attention on the GOP s long running and thus far unsuccessful effort to end ACA  I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me   the Republican Party   Trump tweeted  adding   I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election  That s not how congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader McConnell  understood Trump s sudden shift to the issue last week Nor did it stop Democrats from calling attention to the health care issue Wednesday The Democratic controlled House used a near party line 240 186 vote to condemn the Trump administration for joining a federal lawsuit aimed at annulling former President Barack Obama s health care law  Minutes later  the House Democrats  campaign organization launched digital ads in the districts of around 40 Democrats in competitive seats  saying they d  fought back  against GOP efforts to gut the statute s protections The GOP s bitter internal fight over health care in 2017 remains a sore subject for the president  He often retells the story of the late Arizona Sen  John McCain s  no  vote that killed the repeal and replace effort  Republicans  hit hard on health care issues during the 2018 midterm election  had no plans to take up the issue again before the next one Trump s fight was on display when he told Republican senators last week that his White House was developing a plan to replace the Obama health law  The sudden move stunned GOP leaders on Capitol Hill  While Trump wanted them to become  the party of health care   they feared it could be for all the wrong reasons if they were forced into a do over of the tough votes McConnell on Tuesday issued a rare public disclosure of his private counsel to the president  warning that another health care fight would be politically costly and doomed to fail now that Democrats control the House  The usually tight lipped leader said afterward that the president agreed to shelve his health care push until after the campaign  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters Tuesday Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week   backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  mindful that Republican unfulfilled promises to  repeal and replace  the Obama era law stand as a glaring failure of his administration  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   Trump said Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  After Trump said last week he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  McConnell faced a revolt from the ranks McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking    Associated Press writers Zeke Miller  Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram  Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar  Darlene Superville and Kevin Freking contributed to this report

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee approved subpoenas Wednesday for special counsel Robert Mueller s full Russia report as Democrats pressure the Justice Department to release the document without redactions The committee voted 24 17 to give Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler  D N Y   permission to issue subpoenas to the Justice Department for the final report  its exhibits and any underlying evidence or materials prepared for Mueller s investigation  Nadler has not yet said if he ll send the subpoenas  which would be the first step in a potentially long fight with the Justice Department over the materials The Judiciary panel also voted Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trump s former top advisers  stepping up a separate  wide ranging investigation into Trump and his personal and political dealings On the Mueller report  House Democrats had given Attorney General William Barr until Tuesday to provide an unredacted verson to Congress  along with underlying materials  The Justice Department ignored that deadline  with Barr telling committee chairmen in a letter last week that he was in the process of redacting portions of the almost 400 page report and it would be released by mid April   if not sooner  The vote further escalates the Democrats  battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see  a fight that could eventually head to court if the two sides can t settle their differences through negotiation  Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr In the letter last week  Barr said he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material  in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that  would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties  Democrats say they want access to all of that information  even if some of it can t be disclosed to the public  Nadler said he will give Barr time to change his mind on redactions  but if they cannot reach an agreement they will issue the subpoenas  in very short order   He also said he is prepared to go to court to get the grand jury information  This committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job  not the attorney general s  to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his office   Nadler said The five former Trump advisers who could receive subpoenas are strategist Steve Bannon  communications director Hope Hicks  chief of staff Reince Priebus  White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson  Donaldson served as McGahn s chief of staff before both left the administration The five were key witnesses in Mueller s probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month  along with dozens of other people connected to Trump  Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Mueller s investigation  were sent outside the White House   meaning the committee should have access to them because they may not be covered by executive privilege The top Republican on the Judiciary panel  Georgia Rep  Doug Collins  said at the vote that the five subpoenas are misguided because two of the individuals have already provided 3 000 documents to the committee and that the other three have indicated a willingness to cooperate Collins said the authorization for all of the subpoenas is  reckless  and that Democrats shouldn t be asking for documents that the Justice Department can t legally disclose to the public  The committee rejected a GOP amendment that would have blocked the subpoenas from applying to grand jury information  We have a pre emptive chairman who has gone out with pre emptive subpoenas today on a report that has already been promised him   Collins said   This is nothing but political theater  Trump himself has largely deferred to Barr on the report s release while also saying he wouldn t mind if the full version was made public  Still  he has criticized Democrats for seeking the unredacted information  He tweeted Tuesday that  there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy  Nadler or House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff  who has also called for the full release Mueller notified Barr that he had completed the investigation March 22 and sent him the report  In a four page summary of that report released two days later  Barr wrote that the special counsel did not find that Trump s campaign  conspired or coordinated  with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election  He also said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation  instead setting out  evidence on both sides  of the question Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter  declaring that Mueller s evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe  Democrats criticized Barr s assessment  saying they instead want to see what Mueller wrote  

MADISON  Wis    Conservative Brian Hagedorn s strong showing in Wisconsin s Supreme Court race cheered state Republicans Wednesday  with their first positive result in a statewide election since 2016 suggesting reasons for optimism next year in a critical presidential battleground Hagedorn led liberal backed Lisa Neubauer by 5 962 votes   less than half a percentage point   in a race that could still go to a recount  But it came after a string of losses by Republicans in special and statewide elections since Donald Trump carried the state While Republicans were excited  they were also cautious about what Hagedorn s showing means for President Donald Trump s re election  Nobody should assume because Republicans won this race that they will continue to win everything else   Republican strategist and former state GOP leader Brandon Scholz said   This is one election where all the pieces came together at the end  2020 is an entirely different  politically charged animal with the presidential race  Republican U S  Sen  Ron Johnson  who has been leading GOP efforts to rebound following the 2018 election  credited Hagedorn s showing with a ground up engagement with conservatives who were angry with attacks in the race and national Democratic priorities  This is the recipe for success   he said   That s what I ve been preaching since the day after the November 2018 election  We have to energize  rely on the grassroots  Hagedorn benefited from a late infusion of  1 2 million from the Republican State Leadership Committee  Conservative talk radio  including former Republican Gov  Scott Walker for three hours the day before the election  also worked to drive up turnout Republicans compared attacks on Hagedorn to those on U S  Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh  National political fights over the release of Robert Mueller s investigation into Trump and ongoing court battles over a lame duck legislative session in Wisconsin also fueled interest in the race  GOP strategists said Hagedorn said attacks against him over long ago blog writings  including calling Planned Parenthood a  wicked organization  and denouncing court rulings that favored gay rights  motivated his supporters Democrats took the result as a sign that despite a string of wins  including ousting Walker in November  nothing can be taken for granted  Not that Democrats needed it  but it s another wakeup call that every single election here is going to be highly competitive   said Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki   This is not a red state  This is not a blue state  This is the deepest shade of purple there is on the spectrum  Neubauer didn t immediately say whether she would request a recount  which would face a tough challenge in overturning such a large margin and which would come at her expense  She immediately appealed to supporters for money in case she pursues the recount  Counties have until April 12 to report final vote totals  and Neubauer has three days after that to request a recount The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been the deciding force in several partisan battles over policy in recent years  and is itself clearly partisan   conservatives hold a 4 3 edge  Democrats had hoped Neubauer would capture a seat currently held by a liberal justice  maintaining that spread but positioning them to win the majority in another election next year Unless Hagedorn s apparent victory is undone by recount  conservatives instead will enjoy a 5 2 majority and won t be at risk of losing it until at least 2023  The high court already looks likely to decide early disputes between new Democratic Gov  Tony Evers and majority Republicans in the Legislature Turnout was nearly 27   well above the 22  of last year s state Supreme Court race  Hagedorn overcame Neubauer s huge margins in the liberal strongholds of Madison and Milwaukee by running up the vote in Green Bay and more rural parts of northeastern and north central Wisconsin  Those are both parts of the state that helped fuel Trump s win in 2016 Wisconsin recounted its presidential vote in 2016 at Green Party candidate Jill Stein s expense  In that recount of nearly 3 million ballots  only 131 votes were changed   in favor of Trump  Neubauer  in a recount of just 1 2 million ballots  would have to pick up 45 times as many votes The 2016 presidential recount cost local election clerks  2 million   more than the  1 7 million Neubauer raised during the entire campaign through March 18  However  those costs included overtime for clerks who had to count nearly 2 9 million votes under a tight deadline due to the Electoral College Given the recent tight elections  Republicans are taking nothing for granted going into 2020  Johnson said  We have to run almost perfect elections going forward   he said  If  Democrats  are energized  we re going to have issues  Nobody will be overconfident  We know what s at stake        Associated Press writer Ivan Moreno contributed to this report from Pewaukee  Wisconsin

can lose their guns if they are   or were formerly   married to their victim  live with their victim  have a child with their victim or are a parent or guardian of their victim  The proposed provision would extend those who can be convicted of domestic abuse to include stalkers and current or former boyfriends or dating partners Jennifer Baker  a spokeswoman for the N R A   said that for  many of those  offenses    and I m using air quotes here   the behavior that would qualify as a stalking offense is often not violent or threatening  it involves no personal contact whatsoever   She argues that the new provision is  too broad and ripe for abuse   Like if you were sending harassing messages to somebody on Facebook  to somebody you never met or somebody you dated five years ago   she said  adding   How it s written right now  you could be convicted for a misdemeanor stalking offense for a tweet that causes someone emotional distress and then you would be prohibited from owning a firearm  Others find the N R A  s argument far fetched   A single tweet or Facebook message  without significant other conduct  would ordinarily not be enough  to result in a conviction for stalking  said David Keck  director of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms  which provides guidance to law enforcement and governments on implementing firearms prohibitions  but takes no position on the new domestic violence act provision And times have changed for the gun lobby  A wave of freshman Democrats in Congress were elected on a promise to enact new gun restrictions  and they proudly campaigned against the N R A  The No  1 way that women are being killed with guns is by their beloveds  their boyfriends  their significant others   said one of those freshman Democrats  Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia   I am not paying attention to the rhetoric of the N R A  because I can t be distracted  What s most important is putting forth good legislation to save as many lives as we can   Ms  McBath s son  Jordan Davis  was shot to death in 2012 Roughly half of all female homicide victims are killed by what experts call  intimate partners    meaning current or former spouses or dating partners   according to a 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  And about half of intimate partner homicides involved dating relationships  according to Mr  Keck The  boyfriend loophole  provision is  a refocus on should we be just looking at domestic partners or should we be looking more broadly at intimate partners   he said Studies also show that domestic abusers with guns inflict a disproportionate amount of violence on their partners  and that the victims are overwhelmingly female  Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a firearm  according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence  a gun safety group  Roughly three quarters of all intimate partner murder victims were also victims of stalking by their partners  according to the National Center for Victims of Crime  The share of homicides committed by dating partners has been increasing for three decades   said Shannon Watts  who founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  a group that supports tighter gun laws  in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012   Women are now as likely to be killed by dating partners as by spouses with guns  The reauthorization bill has one Republican co sponsor  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania  Representative Kevin McCarthy  the House Republican leader  is urging Congress to extend the expired law for the rest of the year to continue funding services to survivors at current levels  Ms  Baker  of the N R A   accused Democrats of  playing politics  with the bill by inserting the so called boyfriend provision as a  poison pill  so that Democrats can portray Republicans who vote against it as anti woman The N R A  has decided to  score  the vote on the Violence Against Women Act  meaning it will keep track and publish how lawmakers vote in an effort to either reward or defeat them in the next election  While the move is not likely to keep the bill from passing the House  it does make it more likely that the  boyfriend loophole  provision will be stripped from the act when the measure arrives in the Senate  Anybody who votes for this should take the outrage of the N R A  and wear it proudly   said Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  who drafted the provision as a separate bill and fought for it to be included in the Violence Against Women Act Ms  Dingell   whose husband  John D  Dingell Jr   who died this year  served on the N R A  s board of directors   has spoken powerfully of her experiences as a child  cowering in the closet in fear of her father  who struggled with mental illness and had a gun  I am not someone who wants to take people s guns away   she said   I have lived with a man that was an N R A  board member and with a man that shouldn t have had a gun  And I want to stand up for both sides  The move to oppose the act comes as the N R A  s power is increasingly being challenged on Capitol Hill and in statehouses around the country by gun control activists  including many students who have taken up the charge after the massacre last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Fla Twenty six states and the District of Columbia passed 67 new gun safety laws in 2018  according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence  On Capitol Hill  the House in February passed legislation expanding background checks to cover nearly all gun purchases   the first significant gun safety measure in 25 years Even in the Republican controlled Senate  Senator Lindsey Graham  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  convened a hearing last week on  red flag laws  or extreme risk protection orders that allow family members and law enforcement officers to obtain court restraining orders to remove firearms from people who have been identified as a risk to themselves or others So far  14 states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing extreme risk protection orders  Mr  Graham said he is working on legislation to create incentives for states to enact such bills  Ms  Baker said the N R A  agrees with the idea in theory but has not supported any of the state laws because of  serious due process concerns  The idea has gained traction in some unlikely places   including the White House  where President Trump embraced it when Vice President Mike Pence raised it during a meeting with lawmakers after the school massacre in Parkland  Or Mike  take the firearms first and then go to court   Mr  Trump told Mr  Pence  adding   because a lot of times  by the time you go to court  it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures  I like taking the guns early

damage in Freeport  Ill CreditScott P  Yates Rockford Register Star  via Associated PressThe news that Anna Sorokin  the New York  party girl grifter  whose story has fascinated society and Hollywood and who is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court  has been advised by a stylist on what to wear for her courtroom appearances should not really come as a surprise to anyone  Increasingly  it seems  there is a tendency to rely on experts to help navigate the thorny issues of what to wear when  and not just for highly fraught events Consider  for example  the recent reports that J B  Pritzker  the governor of Illinois  has daily notations on his official schedule related to dress  Or rather  how to dress for different occasions  This has gotten less attention than Ms  Sorokin s news has  he is  to be fair  a somewhat less sensationalist figure   but in many ways it is a similarly revealing sign of the times According to John O Connor of The Associated Press  who used the Freedom of Information Act to get access to the governor s schedule during the first six weeks of his term  there were more than 70 written recommendations regarding what the governor should wear to various planned events  The advice included when to bring multiple tie choices  for his official photo  he went with marine blue with white polka dots   when to forget the tie altogether  as well as what occasions were best for the  polo with Columbia jacket  At first  like Mr  O Connor  I thought this was unusual  Governor Pritzker  after all  has been a businessman and philanthropist  and presumably knows how to dress for the office  So I called Jordan Abudayyeh  Mr  Pritzker s press secretary  to ask why it was necessary  She said the notations were  standard operating procedure  meant to make his life simpler and make sure he always looked appropriate  She did not have much else to add Which is too bad  because Mr  Pritzker and his team are indeed far from alone in this particular strategy  though they may be taking it to a slightly more extreme level than most According to Ryan Williams  a Republican strategist and former aide to Mitt Romney during Mr  Romney s time as governor of Massachusetts and his two presidential campaigns  it was  not unusual  to jot down on the governor s schedule whether the dress code for an event was  business  casual or black tie   During the campaigns  this could be even more detailed  depending on the event   A country barbecue  for example  might require more thought   Donna Brazile  the onetime interim head of the Democratic National Committee and a recently signed Fox News contributor  said that in her experience such advice came from communications and advance teams and was  part of the message of the day   Also  that it had become increasingly important and  perhaps  detailed ImageGovernor Pritzker unveils his graduated income tax plan at the Illinois State Capitol CreditJustin L  Fowler The State Journal Register  via Associated Press Once upon a time  you had three dress codes  business  casual and formal   she wrote in an email  noting that today candidates can dress to  signal everything from leadership style to their political branding  and hence need a certain amount of premeditation Bennet Ratcliff  a former political consultant who worked with the Democratic Governors Association  pointed out that social media has exacerbated the situation  A politician is now dressing not just for the people in the room but also the people scrolling past a picture of said politician with the people in the room   and may be stopping to look or think In that context  you can go one of two ways  adopt an effective uniform that communicates an attitude of formality in representing the job  see  for example  President Trump  who rarely appears in public without a jacket  and seems happiest in his oversize suits and below the belt red ties   or dress to fit in with the group you are with  In which case maybe you need a bit of help determining what that means There is nothing wrong with this  or with thinking about this  it doesn t reveal a superficiality or lack of substance  which is often the default fear when the topic of clothing comes up  On the contrary  it acknowledges the truth that we all make snap judgments based first on appearance  and then make a choice about how much time and brain space need to be devoted to influencing those judgments  and how much can be delegated This should be something everyone can relate to  given the current craziness around dress codes in general  be it the complete nonsense of events that request  creative dress  or  dress to impress  or the difficulty of corporate strictures on dressing  appropriately  in an office setting  a word so vague that it is practically meaningless   Yes  Goldman Sachs  this means you   To a certain extent  we are always in search of dress recommendations and instruction  as the social and professional codes of yesteryear have eroded under the increasing commingling of life and work  putting an end to unspoken uniforms  That s why stylists and personal shoppers have become such a booming business  increasingly famous in their own right  In many ways  politics has been the most insulated of all professions  but clearly  even that is changing  And really  if there is such a thing as a courtroom stylist  can a political stylist be far behind  This is essentially the role Meredith Koop played for Michelle Obama  though officially her job was general aide  and how Hervé Pierre functions for Melania Trump  Mr  O Connor of The Associated Press said that after he discovered the dress notations on Mr  Pritzker s schedule  he asked to speak with the governor about the subject but to no avail  his email request received no response  which was  he said  a rarity in his experience   Frankly  I think Governor Pritzker missed a great opportunity  He would have done everyone a favor if  once the topic was on the table  he had embraced it  Imagine how liberating it would be if a politician  especially a male one  was secure enough to give an interview about the importance of dressing the part  and how useful it was to have someone thinking about that so he could use his time crafting policy  be it for flood management or health care Especially because the question of public figures and what they wear and who helps decide that is bound to become more fraught during the coming Democratic primary  as the pressure to distinguish oneself will put more onus on crafting an identifiable image that stands apart while simultaneously standing for something  Arguably Beto O Rourke has already proven himself to be working this angle  at least judging by his Vanity Fair cover and his skill at casting himself as the people s pol Though given that he hired a campaign manager only last week  chances are he is still styling himself  

LONDON   Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday broke with her own party  appealing to the opposition to work with her on a plan in a move that could keep Britain closely tied to the European Union after the country leaves the bloc Mrs  May made the announcement after her cabinet had met for seven hours  amid a growing sense of crisis  With only 10 days left until Britain is due to leave the European Union  she also said she would ask leaders of the bloc for an extension Parliament is deadlocked on the issue  and lawmakers are increasingly alarmed by the prospect of careering out of the bloc without an agreement Her overture to the Labour Party could mark a turning point in Brexit  as Britain s exit from the European Union is known  ending months of stalemate between Mrs  May and Conservative hard liners  who have adamantly refused to support the deal she negotiated with the European Union  This basically rips up the last two and a half years as far as her stance goes   said Tim Bale  professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London  It seems the calculation has changed  and finally the country s interests have been put above those of the Conservative Party   he added Mrs  May s deal with Europe has two parts  a withdrawal agreement  which details the practical terms of the divorce  and a political declaration  which outlines Britain s future relationship with the bloc The prime minister said the withdrawal agreement must stand  even though Parliament has rejected it three times already  European leaders have insisted upon this Under the withdrawal agreement  Britain would remain in the European Union customs and trading system until at least the end of 2020 Negotiations with the Labour Party will center on changes to the political declaration  However  these would be nonbinding and could be dismantled by a future British government Mrs  May s plan had envisioned eventually severing ties with the bloc s customs and trading system  and taking control over immigration from continental Europe Until now  she has refused to consider softening any of these so called red lines The only option Mrs  May will not negotiate with the opposition is canceling Brexit altogether  Closer economic ties with the bloc through a customs union or membership in its single market are up for discussion and even a referendum confirming any deal has not been excluded  Mrs  May s aides said Within an hour of Mrs  May s announcement  pro Brexit Conservatives began to express their dissent  amid reports that a number of cabinet ministers had argued against a further extension Whether the prime minister can win the cooperation of the Labour Party   and whether the European Union will grant her request for another delay   remained unclear  I m very happy to meet the prime minister   said Jeremy Corbyn  the Labour leader  after Mrs  May s announcement  We recognize that she has made a move   he added   I recognize my responsibility to represent the people who supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn t support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future  And that s the basis on which we will meet her and have those discussions  Still  to move forward with this plan  he will have to become involved in the tumultuous negotiation  and share responsibility for the success or failure of Brexit  Some Conservatives expressed dismay that the Labour Party would now be more involved  It is very disappointing that the cabinet has decided to entrust the final handling of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party   said Boris Johnson  who resigned from Mrs  May s cabinet and is considered a front runner to replace her  in an interview with the BBC  I think the result will almost certainly be  if Corbyn gets his way  that we remain in the customs union so that we can t control our trade policy  that there are huge areas of lawmaking we can t control  and Brexit is becoming soft to the point of disintegration   he said It has never been clear whether Mrs  May was willing to lead the country into a no deal exit  a threat she raised repeatedly in tough talking speeches at the start of negotiations A powerful faction in the Conservative Party  to which she has devoted most of her adult life  has shifted to a hard line position  shrugging off warnings of severe economic consequences with a no deal exit  and advocating what they called  a clean break  It was unclear whether Mrs  May had shifted as well  Her remarks on Tuesday  however  suggested that she had not  When it came down to it  she was just too sensible   said Rosa Prince  the author of a biography of Mrs  May   She s got to be thinking of her legacy now  and if people are dying for lack of medicine  if there are food shortages  if Britain goes feral  that s not how she wants to be remembered  Speaking at 10 Downing Street  Mrs  May said it was clear Britain would need an extension to Brexit  but  one that is as short as possible  Mrs  May s immediate plan is to try to reach an agreement with Mr  Corbyn and get Parliament s support for it before next week s European Union summit in Brussels on April 10 Alternatively  she said  Parliament would vote on an array of alternatives  with the government promising to accept the outcome Mrs  May hopes Britain might still be able to leave the bloc next month and avoid holding elections to the European Parliament  Failing that  she would ask for an extension that could be curtailed as soon as Britain had ratified its withdrawal agreement After Tuesday s extraordinary cabinet meeting  ministers were held in Downing Street without access to cellphones until Mrs  May had spoken  a sign she wanted to get her version out before her fractious cabinet started leaking  Chilean wine was served as they waited Upon emerging  cabinet members told journalists that they had discussed the option of calling a general election  but that polling suggested that the Conservative Party might fare poorly if a new election was called now Mrs  May s willingness to adjust her position on Brexit came  too late   said Ayesha Hazarika  a political commentator and former Labour adviser   This should have been done right at the beginning  She added   It shows how catastrophically badly she has handled the chronology of the process  By this stage  Ms  Hazarika said   the politics are too raw on both sides   and Mr  Corbyn will be under intense pressure to call for a second referendum Mr  Corbyn himself is a longtime euroskeptic  but many of his party members are pushing strongly for a second referendum or for canceling Brexit altogether  Labour is also intent on holding a general election in the near future Mr  Corbyn  who has safely criticized the government from the margins  risks being held responsible for an unpopular result if he cooperates with Mrs  May  Ms  Hazarika said  Their strategy has been to have a clean hands Brexit  the Tories will mess it all up   she said   If she s co opting him to be a co pilot  does he want to take that responsibility   He s got a big strategic question to ask   she added She said the next days were likely to bring all kinds of bizarre twists  like collaboration between Mr  Corbyn and Conservative backbenchers in an effort to bring Mrs  May down in a no confidence vote  Anything is possible right now   she said   There are so many wheels within wheels right now  I have never seen anything like it   

WASHINGTON   U S  congressional Democrats on Wednesday authorized a powerful committee chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 election  moving closer to a legal clash with President Donald Trump s administration The Democratic led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to enable its chairman  Jerrold Nadler  to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller s unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides including political strategist Steve Bannon Nadler has not yet exercised that authority  with the timing of any such move uncertain  The committee vote was 24 17 along party lines  with Democrats in favor and Trump s fellow Republicans opposed Attorney General William Barr  a Trump appointee  issued a four page summary of Mueller s main conclusions last month including that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400 page report by mid April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence gathering sources and methods In addition to Bannon  the committee authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn  former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson They are among 81 people  agencies and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates Nadler s panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would ignore a Democratic demand turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline  Democrats have expressed concern Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign Nadler said he would work with Barr  for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials  and will go to court to get permission to obtain the grand jury material  But if that doesn t work out in a very short order  we will issue the subpoenas   Nadler added       The committee must see everything   The potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government s third branch   the judiciary Representative Doug Collins  the committee s top Republican  said Democrats are  desperate for dirt on this president   This is reckless  It s irresponsible  And it s disingenuous   Collins said   It s also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing  making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy  It was not clear how likely the Justice Department would be to hand over subpoenaed documents  It could ignore a subpoena  running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress  and prepare for a potentially lengthy court battle INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACTIONIn another development  the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic led House Intelligence Committee  led by Trump critic Adam Schiff  is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump s inaugural committee Citing people familiar with the request  the Journal reported that the effort signaled that Congress is expanding its probe of how the inaugural committee raised and spent more than  100 million  The report could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters Barr s March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice  Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller s inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump  Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice  Moscow denied election interference  Mueller and U S  intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U S  Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report  If the department still refuses  then it should be up to a judge   not the president or his political appointee   to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record   Nadler said  Trump ally Lindsey Graham  Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  wrote on Twitter that the House panel s demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was  dangerous and ridiculous  The Justice Department declined comment  Priebus declined to comment  A lawyer for Priebus  Bannon and McGahn  as well as a Bannon spokeswoman  did not immediately respond to requests for comment Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries  Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge s permission to get access to Mueller s grand jury material  which is protected under federal law  Nadler said Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far  Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well  noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report s release to Congress   Reporting by David Morgan  Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld  Sarah N  Lynch  Steve Holland and Mark Hosenball  Editing by

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform voted Tuesday to issue a subpoena to the former head of the personnel security division at the White House after a whistle blower accused him of putting national security in jeopardy by mismanaging security clearances The whistle blower  Tricia Newbold  a manager in the White House s Personnel Security Office  told the committee in a private interview last month that senior Trump administration officials granted security clearances to at least 25 individuals whose applications had been denied by career employees for  disqualifying issues   including drug use and criminal conduct  the committee s Democratic staff said in a memo released on Monday Ms  Newbold said the top personnel security official  Carl Kline  reversed a decision to deny a clearance for a senior White House official after a background check turned up multiple concerns  including possible foreign influence  She also said Mr  Kline granted a security clearance to a second White House official despite concerns voiced by a specialist When Ms  Newbold repeatedly pointed out his actions  she said he discriminated against her over her short stature  which is caused by a form of dwarfism  She filed a complaint against him with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission A White House spokesman declined to comment on the subpoena  In a statement  Mr  Kline s lawyer  Robert Driscoll  said the  facts will prove that he acted appropriately at all times   Mr  Driscoll said he received the subpoena from Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the committee  on Tuesday evening The committee also voted on Tuesday to authorize subpoenas related to the Trump administration s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire  an issue that is being taken up by the United States Supreme Court These committee votes authorized some of the first subpoenas for members of the Trump administration after Democrats  who promised to be a check on the White House  gained the House majority in the midterm elections Mr  Cummings said during Tuesday s meeting that despite claims the committee was just trying to  embarrass  the president with its newfound subpoena power  the move to compel testimony from Mr  Kline was meant to protect national security  The vote  22 to 15  was along party lines NBC News reported in January that Mr  Kline  who was Ms  Newbold s boss  had overruled a decision by career security officials concerned about granting a clearance to Jared Kushner  President Trump s son in law and senior adviser Ms  Newbold  a 39 year old employee who has worked in the White House for 18 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations  said she decided to go to the committee after attempts to raise concerns with her superiors and the White House counsel went nowhere  according to the Democratic staff s account  She s begging us to do something   Mr  Cummings said during the meeting   Because she simply wants her government to work the way it s supposed to work  Republicans on the committee argued against the subpoena because Mr  Kline s lawyer indicated that Mr  Kline was willing to appear before the panel voluntarily  In their own memo summarizing Ms  Newbold s comments to the committee  they presented her concerns as overblown and depicted her as a disgruntled federal employee  We re going to subpoena a guy who just sent us a letter saying he s willing to come here voluntarily   said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio  the committee s top Republican   I ve been on this committee 10 years  I ve never seen anything like this  But Mr  Cummings said that Mr  Kline  who now works at the Department of Defense  refused to answer questions from the committee about specific federal officials and clearance decisions during a voluntary appearance  Mr  Cummings said that the White House refused two committee requests to interview Mr  Kline and that Mr  Kline did not respond to two separate requests sent directly to him since January In a letter to Mr  Cummings  dated Tuesday  Mr  Driscoll wrote that his client was willing to appear but that the White House Counsel s Office deemed some of the proposed topics as an infringement upon President Trump s rights as the chief executive  Mr  Driscoll called a subpoena an  extreme and unnecessary step  Mr  Cummings said he planned to seek testimony from other senior White House officials as well Most of the Republican members of the committee also opposed the majority s proposal to subpoena testimony from a top Justice Department official  John Gore  about adding a citizenship question to the census The committee voted mostly along party lines to authorize a subpoena for testimony from Mr  Gore  as well as for documents from the Justice Department and the Commerce Department  some of which were either denied to the committee or heavily redacted One Republican member  Representative Justin Amash of Michigan  joined the Democrats in the vote The White House did not provide official comment on the census related subpoenas  Mr  Jordan accused Democratic members of the committee of trying to interfere in the court proceedings over the citizenship question In January  a federal trial judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding the question  saying the process that led to the decision was deeply flawed  The Supreme Court in February agreed to hear the case  putting it on a fast track ahead of the June deadline for printing the questionnaires  

WASHINGTON   Senate Democrats blocked a GOP attempt on Tuesday to change Senate rules to limit debate time on most of President Donald Trump s nominees to just a couple of hours The party line vote is another step toward a potential power play by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who is considering ramming the rules change through later this week using an arcane parliamentary maneuver The proposed rules change would limit debate on most nominees to two hours instead of the 30 hours now required  Cabinet secretaries  Supreme Court nominations  and appeals court judges would be exempted from the new rules Tuesday s approach required 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster  but McConnell s upcoming maneuver would only require a simple majority McConnell said Tuesday he s taking action in response to  systematic obstruction  not targeted  thoughtful opposition to a few marquee nominations or rare circumstances  but a grinding  across the board effort to delay and obstruct the people this president puts up  Democrats said Republicans abused the old rules   which required a 60 vote margin to break a filibuster for all nominees   to thwart dozens of nominees of former President Barack Obama  Democrats changed the filibuster threshold to a simple majority in 2013 over outraged protests by Republicans such as McConnell Shortening the debate time  they maintain  would allow Republicans to run roughshod over them  The hurdles and hoops required to win confirmation should be difficult  they say  as a means to ensure nominees are ethical and qualified and responsive to requests by senators for information  The purpose of these rules is to reject partisanship so that we can get nominees who will put the good of the country before politics   said Sen  Amy Klobuchar  D Minn   If we eliminate this crucial check on our democracy  allowing the majority to ram through these appointments  we will undermine our democracy and our government  Republicans counter that it is Democrats who are abusing the process now by claiming the full 30 hours of debate time for noncontroversial picks  Often  the Senate chamber sits empty as the clock ticks on these picks  And Obama benefited from abbreviated debate times for most nominations under a temporary arrangement over 2013 14 that suited Democrats just fine back then  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is suggesting he will defer until after 2020 his push for a Republican health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act Trump tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections   when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House  Republicans were cool after Trump surprised them last week with an unexpected pivot to the issue and his claims the GOP will be the party of health care  They don t yet have a comprehensive plan to replace the law  known as  Obamacare  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017  And while Republicans gained Senate seats last fall  there s no indication that GOP senators want another fight over repealing  Obamacare   particularly not those up for re election next year Health care  especially protections for people with pre existing conditions  resonates with voters and helped Democrats in the November elections According to AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide  nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care as the most important among a list of key issues  A Quinnipiac University poll last week found 55  of Americans supporting the improvement and not the replacement of the nation s health care system With Democrats controlling the House  any attempt to dismantle the law could not pass Congress Still  Trump last week appeared to commit his party to a new push for a plan to replace the health law  We are working very hard on that   Trump said as he was heading out to a Michigan rally He said Republicans  are going to work together to come up with something that s really spectacular  In his late Monday tweets  Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that  will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America  Challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts Last week  the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down  an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured and reignite a winning political issue for Democrats  

Former Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Wednesday that his tendency toward physical displays of affection and encouragement has made some women uncomfortable  and he promised to be  much more mindful  of respecting personal space  Social norms have begun to change  They ve shifted   the 76 year old Biden said in a cellphone video posted to Twitter    And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset  And I get it  I get it  I hear what they are saying  I understand  Wearing a suit and open collared shirt  Biden also teased an announcement of his political plans  promising to  be talking to you about a whole lot of issues   Shortly after the video was released  a union announced Biden would speak at their conference in Washington on Friday The video was Biden s first direct comment on what has tripped up his preparations to enter the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign  He did not directly apologize but seemed to be seeking to ease some people s discomfort  which has raised questions about whether he could wage an effective campaign On Friday  former Nevada politician Lucy Flores wrote in New York Magazine that Biden approached her from behind  touched her shoulders and kissed the back of her head in 2014 Since then  another woman has said Biden grabbed her face when he was thanking congressional staff at a 2009 event Biden  a former longtime U S  senator from Delaware  first said in a statement that he did not recall the episode that Flores initially described in the magazine piece and then in subsequent weekend interviews In the video Wednesday  Biden insisted that what he described as the compassion from where the affection comes will not change and again nodded to the steps he s taking toward running  But I ll always believe governing   life  for that matter   is about connecting  connecting with people   he said   That won t change  Biden also said that he would be more careful about his actions in the future  And I ll be much more mindful  That s my responsibility  my responsibility  and I ll meet it   Biden said And in so doing  Biden was tacitly acknowledging a nagging concern for some voters  that he cannot adapt  The idea that I can t adjust to the fact that personal space is important  more important than it s ever been  is just not thinkable   he said in closing   I will  I will   

WASHINGTON   Two civil liberties groups on Tuesday sued three U S  intelligence chiefs and the acting defense secretary  seeking to have declared unconstitutional their agencies  pre publication reviews of former officials  writings and speeches The American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  and Columbia University s Knight First Amendment Institute brought the lawsuit on behalf of five former intelligence and military officials  They argued the reviews as currently practiced breach the Constitution s First Amendment prohibition on government abridgement of freedom of speech The plaintiffs contended that reviews also violate the Constitution s Fifth Amendment  because the procedures can involve arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and fail to define what can or cannot be said The action was brought in U S  District Court in Greenbelt  Maryland  against Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats  CIA Director Gina Haspel  National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan Pentagon  NSA and CIA spokesmen said they do not comment on pending litigation  Coats  office declined to comment  This is a challenge to a far reaching system of prior restraints that suppresses a broad swath of constitutionally protected speech  including core political speech  by former government employees   said the lawsuit  Under this system  government officials review and censor tens of thousands of submissions every year   it said  Current and former U S  intelligence and military officials are required to submit writings or speeches to pre publication reviews to insure they are not disclosing classified information  The plaintiffs said that review standards differ between agencies and former officials are subjected to the procedures  without regard to their level of access to sensitive information  Reviews frequently take weeks or months and result in censorship decisions that  are often arbitrary  unexplained and influenced by authors  viewpoints   said the lawsuit  adding that  favored officials  can receive  special treatment  that  fast tracks  their speeches or manuscripts As a result of this  dysfunction   many would be authors self censor  denying the public access to information that would inform debate on national security issues  it said The former officials on whose behalf the lawsuit was filed included Richard Immerman  a historian who worked for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  ODNI   Timothy Edgar  a cyber security expect who also worked at ODNI  and Mark Fallon  a former Naval Criminal Investigative Service official who served as the chief investigator at the Guantanamo Bay detention center They also included former senior CIA analyst Melvin Goodman and Anuradha Bhagwati  a Marine Corps veteran    Reporting by Jonathan Landay  editing by Steve Orlofsky  Susan Thomas and Jonathan Oatis

WASHINGTON   U S  Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to deter Russia from meddling in U S  elections by threatening stiff sanctions on its banking  energy and defense industries and sovereign debt The  Deter Act  is the latest effort by U S  lawmakers to increase pressure on Moscow over what they see as a range of bad behavior  from its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria s civil war to attempts to influence U S  elections The measure was introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen  a Democrat  and Marco Rubio  a Republican  They offered a similar measure last year  when it also had bipartisan support but was never brought up for a vote by the Senate s Republican leaders  who have close ties to President Donald Trump Trump has gone along with some previous congressional efforts to increase sanctions on Russia  although sometimes reluctantly  Backers of stronger action against Russia believe such measures will have better prospects in 2019  given control of the House of Representatives by Democrats  who are less reluctant than Trump s fellow Republicans to push back against the White House According to details of the legislation  first reported by Reuters  it would require the U S  Director of National Intelligence  DNI  to determine  within 30 days of any federal election  whether Russia or other foreign government or anyone acting as an agent of that government  had engaged in election interference If the DNI found such interference occurred  the act would require  among other things  that mandatory sanctions be imposed within 10 days on  among others  Russian banks and energy companies The act would mandate that sanctions be imposed on two or more of the following Russian banks  Sberbank  VTB Bank  Gazprombank  Vnesheconombank and Rosselkhozbank It also would order the prohibition of all transactions subject to U S  jurisdiction in Russian sovereign debt  Russian government bonds and the debt of any entity owned or controlled by Russia s government The sanctions would include blocking   freezing without seizing   any assets in the United States of those targeted for sanction  including senior Russian political figures and business leaders Russia denies trying to influence U S  elections  But U S  intelligence and law enforcement agencies have found that Moscow sought to intervene in the 2016 vote to boost Trump s chances of winning the White House An investigation by U S  Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not establish that members of Trump s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election  according to a summary released by U S  Attorney General William Barr last month The Deter Act is targeted at Russia but notes that U S  intelligence has identified China  Iran and North Korea as other major foreign government cyber threats  It also asks that Trump s administration present Congress with a strategy on preventing interference in U S  elections for each of those countries and other countries of significant concern The senators timed the bill s release to come after the end of Mueller s investigation  which has cast a shadow over the first two years of Trump s presidency  and just before an address to Congress by Jens Stoltenberg  secretary general of the NATO alliance  who has focused on the threat posed by Russia   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle  Editing by Peter Cooney and Bill Trott  

HONG KONG   After business groups had criticized a plan to ease rendition of fugitives between Hong Kong and jurisdictions including mainland China  the Hong Kong government pulled back  a little Last week  the Hong Kong authorities dropped from their proposal nine economic crimes that could prompt an extradition But on Wednesday  the government of Chief Executive Carrie Lam showed that it has no intention of stopping its broader push to overhaul its extradition laws  and introduced legislation intended to help Hong Kong send fugitives to jurisdictions that it does not have rendition agreements with John Lee  the Hong Kong secretary for security  said that the legislation would  block loopholes in the overall system of cooperation on criminal justice  But lawyers  associations and human rights groups have broadly criticized the extradition proposal  which has added to fears that Hong Kong s status  which offers greater protection for individual rights and free speech than mainland China does  is fading On Sunday  thousands of protesters marched in a steady rain to express their displeasure with the move  Opponents have called the proposed changes the  send to China rules   a homonym for a Chinese phrase for funerary rites The changes to the extradition policy were proposed after a young woman from Hong Kong was found dead in Taiwan last year  The police in Taiwan said they believe her boyfriend  who is also from Hong Kong  killed her while they were there on vacation The boyfriend was arrested in Hong Kong and charged with several crimes related to the theft of the woman s property  but under local law he could face charges for her killing only in Taiwan Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement with Taiwan  so the authorities proposed changing the rules to make it easier to send suspects to such jurisdictions  including mainland China Hong Kong  a former British colony  returned to Chinese control in 1997 under a framework of  one country  two systems   which allows it to maintain its own local government and legal system Under existing law  Hong Kong can extradite people to places it does not have formal agreements with if the legislature approves such an action But government officials have said that the system is not feasible because the legislative process could alert targets and give them time to flee before the authorities act  The proposed changes will allow Hong Kong s chief executive  the city s top official  to make such decisions instead  The surrender on a case basis is full of matters that make it not practicable   Mr  Lee  the security secretary  said on Tuesday   So to me  it is a loophole that I must plug  ImageJohn Lee  the Hong Kong secretary for security  said that the changes would  block loopholes in the overall system of cooperation on criminal justice  CreditVincent Yu Associated PressThe Hong Kong Bar Association is one group that has been critical of the government s position  On Tuesday  it said that a lack of extradition arrangements with mainland China was not a  loophole   but a decision made by the legislature in 1997 because of fundamentally different systems and concerns about the weak protection for rights across the border  There has been a failure by the government to explain why it considers that circumstances have changed since 1997   the bar association said in a statement It added that if the government chose to omit some economic crimes because of the business community s concerns about due process on the mainland  then it should not permit rendition for any offenses  Cutting only some crimes  does not deal with the fundamental issues underlying rendition of suspects  to mainland China  it said Claudia Mo  a lawmaker and member of the pro democracy coalition in the legislature  called the move to exclude some economic crimes  disgusting   How could you compartmentalize laws like this because you need to appease a certain sector   she said Mr  Lee said that any changes would maintain rights protections  and that suspects would not be extradited over political charges  But criticism has swelled in recent days  with several journalist associations and news outlets rejecting the government s assurances The changes  will not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hong Kong   the media organizations said in a joint statement The statement listed several cases of journalists being harassed in mainland China by the authorities and accused of violations listed in the proposed extradition law changes  including drug offenses and bribery Hong Kong has been shaken by cases of residents who became entangled in mainland legal matters  including the sort of behaviors with political ramifications that are treated as criminal only in authoritarian states Five booksellers who sold thinly sourced works that speculated on elite politics and the personal lives of China s leaders disappeared into mainland custody in late 2015  only to be shown later on state television offering confessions to alleged crimes Taiwan has also raised issue with the legislation  The authorities there have said that they are eager to have Chan Tong kai  the man accused of killing the Hong Kong woman  handed over to face trial But the question of status could create an obstacle  China considers self governed Taiwan to be part of its territory  but Taiwan s Ministry of Justice has said it would not go along with an extradition agreement that makes such a declaration The Hong Kong Bar Association said that such a disagreement raises questions about whether the proposed changes will achieve the stated goal of sending Mr  Chan to Taiwan  Given that the government cannot give any assurance that the proposed amendments will result in a favorable resolution   it said   there is no reason for the government to rush into these controversial and worrying proposals which undermine the international reputation of Hong Kong

WASHINGTON   President Trump has long been focused on measuring his brand  obsessively reviewing television ratings  cataloging his magazine covers and fixating on polls But Mr  Trump may not like how his brand is faring in one important metric  his  E Score   a number compiled by E Poll Market Research that is not publicly available  but which marketing executives  network television stations and advertisers rely on to figure out which personalities appeal to audiences   and which do not Like the Q Score  which measures the appeal of celebrities  the E Score calculates awareness and appeal of individuals in the public eye  But it also tracks how individuals score on more than 40 personality and physical attributes In terms of those attributes  Mr  Trump was most often described as  aggressive   48 percent  and  mean   38 percent   according to his scores from December that were obtained by The New York Times  He also scored high for being  insincere    confident  and  creepy

about 10 000 profiles in its database and surveys about 1 100 online participants every week  started tracking Mr  Trump when he was a television personality on  The Apprentice   according to a

appeal of 9 percent and a strong negative appeal of 43 percent Ms  Sanders  who has phased out the regular White House press briefing  which often had contentious back and forths with reporters  and is now more often seen in friendlier venues like the morning show  Fox   Friends   ranked somewhat higher  with a strong positive appeal of 19 percent and a strong negative appeal of 28 percent The scores show the public views Ms  Sanders as more of an honest broker than Ms  Conway  who became infamous in the administration s early days for coining the phrase  alternative facts  Ms  Sanders scored 15 percent for  trustworthy   compared with Ms  Conway s 8 percent ranking in the same category  Ms  Conway was described by 31 percent of respondents as  insincere   compared with 27 percent

WASHINGTON   A whistle blower working inside the White House has told a House committee that senior Trump administration officials granted security clearances to at least 25 individuals whose applications had been denied by career employees for  disqualifying issues  that could put national security at risk  the committee s Democratic staff said Monday The whistle blower  Tricia Newbold  a manager in the White House s Personnel Security Office  told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform in a private interview last month that the 25 applicants included two current senior White House officials  in addition to contractors and other employees working for the office of the president  the staff said in a memo it released publicly The memo does not identify any of the 25 people  But one of the senior White House officials appears to be Jared Kushner  the president s son in law and senior adviser NBC News reported in January that Carl Kline  who until recently served as the head of the personnel security division and was Ms  Newbold s boss  had overruled a decision by career security officials concerned about granting Mr  Kushner a clearance The New York Times reported in February that President Trump had ordered his chief of staff  John F  Kelly  to grant a clearance last year to Mr  Kushner  The president had earlier said he had no role in the clearance  Over the last few years that I ve been here  I ve been accused of all different types of things  and all of those things have turned out to be false   Mr  Kushner said Monday night on Fox News in response to a question about Ms  Newbold s claims Democrats on the oversight panel are also demanding information from the White House about the process of granting a clearance to Ivanka Trump  among others  Ms  Trump s final clearance was granted shortly after Mr  Kushner s  In an interview in February with ABC News  Ms  Trump insisted her father had no hand in either her clearance or her husband s Ms  Newbold told the committee s staff members that she and other career officials had denied the 25 applications for a variety of reasons  including  foreign influence  conflicts of interest  concerning personal conduct  financial problems  drug use and criminal conduct   the memo said The denials by the career employees were overturned  she said  by officials with more seniority who  by her account  did not follow the normal procedures meant to mitigate security risks and generally adhered to by other administrations Ms  Newbold  who has worked in the White House for 18 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations  said she chose to speak to the committee after attempts to raise concerns with her superiors and the White House counsel went nowhere  according to the committee staff s account  I feel that right now  this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office   she said  according to a summary of her March 23 interview with the committee s staff that was distributed on Monday White House officials have been concerned for weeks that Ms  Newbold would either speak publicly or share information that she had gleaned about how security clearances had been handled during the first half of Mr  Trump s term  Her statements to the Oversight Committee are likely to increase pressure on the White House to address lingering questions about its general practices around keeping the nation s secrets and several high profile cases Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the committee  included information provided by Ms  Newbold in a letter to Pat A  Cipollone  the White House counsel  on Monday  again demanding that the White House turn over files connected to the security clearance process and make administration personnel available for interviews Mr  Cummings said he was prepared to authorize subpoenas as soon as Tuesday to try to compel the White House to comply with an investigation into whether national secrets were at risk   an escalation that could force Mr  Cipollone either to reach an accommodation with Congress or fight in court  I understand that the president has the right to grant these security clearances  but I have the duty and Congress has a duty to be a check on that system   Mr  Cummings told reporters   If the top secrets of our country are being seen by eyes that should not see them  we ought to all be concerned  Mr  Cipollone has argued repeatedly that the power to deny or grant security clearances  belongs exclusively  to the executive branch and  therefore  Congress has no authority to make such  unprecedented and extraordinarily intrusive demands   He has simultaneously accused Mr  Cummings of mischaracterizing his posture toward the committee  writing that his office had been acting in good faith with regard to several of the committee s investigations ImageRepresentative Elijah Cummings  chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee  said he was prepared to authorize subpoenas as soon as Tuesday to try to compel the White House to comply with an investigation into whether national secrets were at risk CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesThe White House did not respond to a request for comment  It is not clear what steps  if any  Mr  Kline might have taken to resolve the security concerns raised by the career employees before overruling them Republicans on Capitol Hill blasted Mr  Cummings for his handling of the case  calling it a  partisan attack on the White House  and accusing him of cherry picking from Ms  Newbold s interview  Chairman Cummings s investigation is not about restoring integrity to the security clearance process  it is an excuse to go fishing through the personal files of dedicated public servants   said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio  the Oversight Committee s top Republican In a nine page memo of their own  Republicans presented Ms  Newbold s concerns about the office s leadership as overblown and  in some cases  typical of a disgruntled federal employee  They said she had told the committee that  only  three of the 25 individuals on her list were  senior level  White House employees  and  only  four or five prompted  very serious reasons  Mr  Cummings said he planned to issue a subpoena for the testimony of Mr  Kline  a nonpolitical federal official who until recently served as the head of the personnel security division and was Ms  Newbold s boss  Mr  Cummings also identified five other senior White House officials whose testimony he planned to seek He requested summaries of the security clearance adjudication process and any related documents for nine current and former officials  including Mr  Kushner  Ms  Trump  the president s elder daughter and senior adviser  and John R  Bolton  the national security adviser In the cases of the two senior White House officials  Ms  Newbold gave the committee a detailed account of her role  the Democratic memo said In one case  she said that a senior White House official was denied a clearance after a background check turned up concerns about possible foreign influence   employment outside or businesses external to what your position at the E O P  entails   and the official s personal conduct   E O P   refers to the executive office of the president Mr  Kline stepped in to reverse the decision  she said  writing in the relevant file that  the activities occurred before federal service  without addressing concerns raised by Ms  Newbold and another colleague In the case of the second senior White House official  Ms  Newbold told the committee that a specialist reviewing the clearance application wrote a 14 page memo detailing disqualifying concerns  including possible foreign influence  She said that Mr  Kline instructed her  do not touch  the case  and soon granted the official clearance There is nothing barring the president or his designees from overturning the assessments of career officials  But Ms  Newbold sought to portray the decisions as unusual and frequent  and  in any case  irregular compared to the processes usually followed by her office to mitigate security risks  Once we adjudicate it  the president absolutely has the right to override and still grant the clearance  but we owe it to the president and the American people to do what is expected of us  and our job is to adjudicate national security adjudications regardless of influence   she told the committee  according to the Democratic staff s memo Republicans  in their memo  stressed that Ms  Newbold had no firsthand knowledge of why Mr  Kline ultimately elected to grant the clearances to the two senior officials  Her testimony focused on a series of personnel and workplace complaints that suggest she is unhappy and dissatisfied in her office   the Republican memo said It noted that Ms  Newbold had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Mr  Kline  accusing him of discriminating against her over her short stature  which is caused by a form of dwarfism  She also filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel In January  Ms  Newbold was suspended for two weeks for failing to follow new office policies  but she told the committee she believed the suspension was retaliation for her E E O C  complaint According to the Democrats  Ms  Newbold also asserted that the Trump administration had made changes to security protocols that made it easier for individuals to get clearances  The changes included stopping credit checks on applicants to work in the White House  which she said helps identify if employees of the president could be susceptible to blackmail  She also said the White House had stopped  for a

WASHINGTON   The Republican led U S  Senate on Wednesday changed its procedures to speed up the confirmation of President Donald Trump s nominees for some lower court judgeships and sub Cabinet level positions The move to shorten debate on such nominees from 30 hours to two hours was resisted by Democrats but they could not block it because Republicans hold 53 seats in the 100 seat chamber Senator Mitch McConnell used his powers as majority leader to make the change  which will set a precedent that will apply to district court judges  the lowest rung of the judiciary  but not vacancies in the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts  The Senate has historically provided greater protection for whichever party is in the minority than the 435 seat House of Representatives by allowing longer debating time before votes and requiring 60 yes votes for most approvals  Those conventions have been whittled away by both Democrats and Republicans in recent years as the mood in Washington has become more and more polarized  however  with each party accusing the other of misusing the rules Reducing the time for debate will  begin to unwind this partisan paralysis  for the good of the Senate   McConnell said on Wednesday  Democrats slammed the procedural change  At a time when leader McConnell brags about confirming more judges than anyone has done in a very long time  he feels the need to invoke the terribly destructive and disproportionate procedure   Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Fifty three district court nominees have been confirmed during Trump s first two years in office against 44 confirmed at the same point in the presidency of Democratic President Barack Obama During Obama s presidency  Senate Democrats took steps to more easily win approval of his nominations by requiring only a simple majority vote for administration posts and judges other than Supreme Court nominees  They also limited debate to two hours  but that move expired at the end of that Congress after Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 elections  In 2017  McConnell expanded the simple majority procedure to include Supreme Court confirmations in order to overcome Democratic opposition to Trump s first nominee  Neil Gorsuch The fight over the confirmation of federal judges has been raging for years  as divisive issues before the courts include hot button issues like abortion  the death penalty and money in politics  Republicans are hoping that they can confirm as many of Trump s conservative picks as possible while they control the Senate and White House Democrats were enraged in 2016 when McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland  Obama s pick to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court At the time  McConnell said that choice should be made by whoever won the November 2016 presidential election Since he became president in January 2017  Trump has won confirmation of 37 appeals court judges  compared to 55 appeals court judge confirmations during Obama s entire eight years  Such confirmation votes would not be subject to Wednesday s procedural change  Click here to see a graphic showing Trump s appeals court appointments  https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL    Reporting By Amanda Becker and Richard Cowan  additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Lawrence Hurley  Editing by Sonya Hepinstall  

The future success of the Democratic Party depends on the crucial   but unsettled   allegiance of the nation s growing Hispanic electorate Fernand Amandi  a Democratic pollster and podcast host based in Miami  addressed the party s Latino quandary in a December interview with The Associated Press The question is not are Democrats winning the Hispanic vote   it s why aren t Democrats winning the Hispanic vote 80 20 or 90 10 the way they are winning black voters In an interview earlier this week  Amandi told me that Democrats  want and hope for this magical osmosis to happen but that s not how politics works  In the 2018 midterms  Democrats showed gains among Hispanic voters in most states  compared with 2014  Party operatives are concerned  however  about the slow rate of growth of these improved Democratic margins  They are equally worried about turnout   at a time when many thought that President Trump s rhetoric and policies would produce impressive gains among Latino voters for the Democratic Party Take turnout  Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic constituencies in the United States  but their level of political participation is not keeping pace with their overall population numbers As the accompanying Pew chart demonstrates  the number of Hispanic voters in midterm elections has grown steadily  from 2 9 million in 1986 to 6 8 million in 2014  At the same time  however  turnout   measured as a percentage of total eligible adult citizens 18 and over   has experienced a relative decline The Growth of the Latino Bloc       g edsall1 box  g artboard

  02           06           10           14         By The New York Times   Source  Pew Research CenterIn 1986  the Latino turnout rate was 38 7 percent  in 2014  that rate fell to 27 1 percent  If the 2014 turnout rate had been as high as it was in 1986  Hispanics would have cast 9 7 million ballots instead of 6 8 million   Complete numbers for 2018 are still being compiled  In a preliminary analysis of Hispanic voter turnout last year  Catalist  a Democratic firm that builds voter lists  found significant increases in turnout of three to five percent  comparing 2018 with the 2014 midterms  Texas  Nevada and California saw five percent increases  Florida four percent  New Mexico and New York three percent Turnout rates and levels of support are two key  but quite different  political measures  While Latinos had a turnout rate of 27 1 percent in 2014  their support for Democratic House candidates that year was 62 percent  Their support for Republican House candidates was 36 percent  according to exit polls While Democratic support among Hispanics has improved over the past decade  from the low 60s to the high 60s  there is evidence suggesting that those gains cannot be relied upon in future elections In the midterm elections  Florida became the prime example of such unreliability  as Republicans demonstrated they could buck state and national trends to make substantial gains among Hispanics Republicans won two close statewide races in Florida in 2018  one for senate and one for governor   despite the gradual erosion of Republican support among Cuban Americans in the state and despite the continuing influx of pro Democratic Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017 Simon Rosenberg  president of NDN  formerly the New Democrat Network  a pro Democratic think tank  wrote   In All Important Florida  Democrats Lose Ground With Hispanic Voters  a month after the 2018 election In an election where Democrats had one of their best years ever with Hispanic voters across the country  Florida Democrats saw their Hispanic numbers decline  Nationally  Democrats went from 62 36  26 pts  in 2014 to 69 29  40 pts  this election  In Florida  Democrats went from 58 38  20 pts  in 2014 to 54 44  10 pts  this year As Rosenberg pointed out  this shift occurred despite the fact that Trump did everything possible to alienate Latinos  along with undercutting Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis  the winning Republican candidates for Senate and governor Rosenberg noted that Trump hadrelentlessly attacked immigrants and Hispanics in particular  He grossly mismanaged the aftermath of Hurricane Maria  sending hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans fleeing to Central Florida  He revoked the temporary status of many immigrants in Florida  Given all this  one would have imagined the environment for Democrats to make gains among Hispanics was present in Florida this year  gains which were made elsewhere  Yet we fell back By all accounts  Scott and DeSantis campaigned almost daily in Hispanic precincts  while their Democratic opponents  Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum  took the Hispanic vote for granted  We had no infrastructure   Christian Ulvert  Gillum s director for Spanish language media  told Politico And honestly  Democrats have been playing catch up on Hispanic outreach for two decades  because Republicans have invested in it  You can t close that gap overnight Politico described Nelson s bid for a fourth term as  a uniquely lazy campaign that made laughably ineffectual attempts to engage with Hispanics  Melissa Michelson  a political scientist at Menlo College in California and president of the Latino caucus of the American Political Science Association  described in an email the changing political orientation of Florida s Cuban Americans In a 1989 90 survey  Michelson wrote  68 8 percent of Cuban Americans identified with Republicans  Since then there have been significant changes  Over the years  she continued  Pew has documented a steady decline in Cuban Americans  Republican identification  from 64 percent in 2002 to 56 percent in 2006 to 47 percent in 2013 Despite the decline in Republican support among Cuban Americans  Michelson emphasized thatThere has always been a contingent of Latinos who identify as Republican and are more interested in Republican conservative  or anti Communist  policies than in immigration issues or racism  Recall that 40 percent of Latinos voted for Bush in 2004  Reagan also enjoyed considerable Latino support  I think many Democrats are continually perplexed by this   that there could be Latino voters who are willing to support a president  or candidate  like Trump whose rhetoric and policies are so clearly anti Latino and racist While Scott and DeSantis revived Cuban American willingness to support Republicans  two of the three Florida House seats that had been represented by Cuban American Republicans switched parties in 2018 Revealing a contrast to Florida  Matt A  Barreto  a political scientist at U C L A  and a co founder of Latino Decisions  analyzed turnout and voting patterns in Texas  In a March report  Barreto described a huge pro Democratic turnout increase there  ranging from 105 to 125 percent in eight counties where Hispanics make up more than 90 percent of the population  There were significant gains in counties with white majorities of 83 to 91 percent too  but these upturns were smaller  in the 35 to 55 percent range The ability of two conservative Florida Republicans to make such inroads simply by campaigning diligently suggests that the Democratic hold on Latinos is less firm than many believed So where do Latinos stand politically The NBC News Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 918 Hispanics during 2018 and found that Trump s job approval rating was a relatively dismal 30 percent  21 points below his 51 percent favorability rating among whites  but 18 points higher than his 12 percent approval rate among African Americans The data  provided to The Times by Public Opinion Strategies  one of the two firms that conducted the survey  found that Trump s approval among Hispanics was highest among men and among the affluent   40 percent for both   and among men without college degrees  at 39 percent A 2018 Pew report   Key takeaways about Latino voters in the 2018 midterm elections   found that Hispanics cast a decisive majority of votes for Democratic congressional candidates  69 29   a smaller percentage of votes  however  than African Americans  90 9  and Asian Americans  77 23   Whites backed Republicans  54 to 44 In a state by state breakdown  Pew found that in the Texas Senate race  Latinos backed Democrat Beto O Rourke over Ted Cruz by nearly two to one  64 35  while Greg Abbott  the incumbent Republican governor  lost the Hispanic vote to Democratic challenger Lupe Valdez  53 42 In Florida  Democrats Gillum and Nelson won the Hispanic vote by nearly equal percentages  54 44 and 54 45    but in both cases by margins that were inadequate to produce overall victory The Democratic winner in the Nevada Senate race  Jacky Rosen  did far better among Hispanics  who backed her over Dean Heller  the Republican incumbent  67 30 While many Democrats expected Trump s anti immigrant rhetoric and policies  especially the family separation debacle  to produce a decisive shift to the left among Hispanics  that has not proved to be the case An October 2018 Pew report found that almosthalf of Latinos  48 percent  believe there is about the right amount of immigrants living in the U S   while a quarter say there are too many immigrants and 14 percent say there are too few  Three quarters of Hispanics opposed Trump s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border  while one in five favors construction In an email  Barreto  of Latino Decisions  argued that Democratic support among Hispanics remains solid I do not see anything since November 2018 to suggest Dems are losing any support at all  Trump continues on the same path of bashing immigrants and bashing Latinos without evidence and this only further decreases his favorability among Latinos Asked about the declining share of eligible Hispanics turning out on Election Day  Barreto countered that the growing numbers of eligible Latinos arealmost entirely driven by U S  born young Latinos turning 18 and entering the eligible voter pool In a common pattern  Barreto pointed out   young people have very low rates of voter registration and voter turnout   especially in midterm elections  Because of that  Barreto said that in order to get a better picture  the data should be age adjusted so that turnout levels of older voters of different races and ethnicities could be compared Barreto is also sharply critical of most polling of Hispanics and of exit polls in particular  arguing that the lack of Spanish speaking interviewers results in an undercount of Hispanic turnout as well as inaccurate estimates of Republican and Democratic votes In addition  candidates and political parties have to make a much stronger case to young Hispanics that their vote matters  according to Barreto Otherwise  you will only get incremental growth each year   which still puts Latinos as a larger and larger share of the electorate  but perhaps not as large as we could be Rosenberg  of NDN  argues that the Democratic Party did not start targeting the Hispanic electorate  with modern campaign tactics and communications  until the 2006 8 period  Those efforts immediately bore fruit  Rosenberg contended in an email Remember that in 2004 Bush won Arizona  Colorado  New Mexico and Nevada  Now Colorado and New Mexico are no longer really competitive at the presidential level  Nevada is slipping away from the Republicans  and Democrats elected a Senator in 2018 in Arizona Texas  according to Rosenberg   is about to hit a tipping point   in large part because of the Hispanic vote What conclusions and what questions remain in the wake of these complex and sometimes conflicting trends in the Hispanic electorate First and foremost  Latinos remain a decisively Democratic constituency  with important caveats Brian Schaffner  a political scientist at Tufts and co principal researcher at the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  wrote in an email that nationally  Hispanic support for Democrats has been relatively consistent Schaffner provided the accompanying graph  which shows the level of voting for Democrats in House contests in the six elections from 2008 to 2018 for whites  blacks  Asian Americans and Hispanics  The Hispanic Democratic vote shows a significant 8 6 point increase from 2014 to 2016 and a 13 6 point increase from 2014 to 2018   call it the Trump jump   although the increase in the percentage of Asian Americans voting for Democrats was even larger at 20 2 points Who Votes for DemocratsOf votes for the two major party candidates in House races  the share that went

Source  analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election Study by Brian Schaffner  Tufts UniversityLatinos  partisan loyalties are much less hard and fast than  say  those of either African Americans or white evangelicals  The results in Florida demonstrate that Democrats risk defeat if they fail to campaign heavily in Hispanic communities  and Republicans stand to gain at the margins if they are prepared to invest time  money and energy The major question mark going into 2020  assuming Trump is the Republican nominee  is whether Hispanic opposition to his presidency will prevent a recurrence of the Florida 2018 phenomenon  Will Trump s presence so nationalize the election that down ballot Republicans will face a brick wall when they try to make modest inroads among Hispanics To date  Trump has shown every intention of turning the election into a referendum on himself  and all the baggage he carries  with no regard for the political survival of fellow Republicans  If anything  he appears determined to drive up hostility to him among Latinos  For the past two days  for example  the president has ranted on Twitter  attacking Puerto Rico and its political leaders On Monday  he told his Twitter followers Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works On Tuesday  he was still at it All their local politicians do is complain   ask for more money  The pols are grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA Behaving this way  Trump may succeed in driving up support among  his people   as he likes to call his voters  But if he keeps it up  he will be doing both his Democratic opponent and the Democratic Party as a whole a huge favor as far

LONDON   British lawmakers long at loggerheads over the path to withdrawing from the European Union actually came close to agreeing on something Monday  a solution known as a  customs union  What is it Simply put  it would entail Britain s agreeing to stay permanently in a customs union with the bloc   a  soft Brexit   of sorts What is a customs union The customs union being proposed in Parliament by a former Conservative chancellor  Ken Clarke  would keep the United Kingdom in the same tariff system as the European Union countries A customs union would help businesses that send goods back and forth to the Continent  so it would be of most interest to Britain s manufacturers  particularly the automobile industry  But some smaller businesses might also benefit What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union And it might also ease complication of the much hated Irish backstop plan  which is intended to eliminate the need for hard border checks between Northern Ireland and the south Sounds good  What s the hitch While a customs union would allow goods to flow more easily  it would not allow for frictionless trade Yes  the agreement would keep the tariffs Britain pays on goods that cross the border equal to those that countries in the European Union pay But it is more complicated than that  The goods being traded will still need to meet the same product standards that apply throughout the bloc  to keep the playing field level ImageA security agent last week at a border post in Coquelles  France  that was built in anticipation of a  no deal Brexit  CreditPhilippe Huguen Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesWhat might that mean for Britain  Just take a look at Turkey Turkey is a member of a customs union with the European Union  but it is not a member of the bloc itself  So trucks on its borders are often held up for hours as guards check for permits and make sure the products being transported are in compliance with regulations set in Brussels And a customs union would not cover trade in services  like legal counsel and information technology  which are by far the largest sector of the British economy But the biggest objection from Brexit backers to a customs union is that countries that are in one are prohibited from making their own trade deals  And that  they argue vociferously  undermines the whole point of leaving the bloc Chris Grayling  the transport secretary  warned on Monday that a customs union would result in the government of Lithuania having  more power  over Britain s trading relationship than British ministers ImageBritain s transport secretary  Chris Grayling  with a fellow cabinet member  Penny Mordaunt  leaving 10 Downing Street last week CreditDaniel Leal Olivas Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThat might explain why only 35 Conservatives voted for the customs union proposal last week Would it at least solve the Irish border problem Well  no  for the same reason that trucks pile up on the border between Turkey and the European Union  Even though tariffs would be equalized  there would remain the need to check that products  particularly food  comply with the bloc s standards That problem could be avoided if Northern Ireland remained aligned with single market rules on food and health standards  But that is alarming to the Brexiteers  who are adamantly opposed to any agreement that would make Northern Ireland subject to different rules than the rest of the United Kingdom In an interview with The Daily Telegraph  Mr  Grayling said it was a  myth  that a customs union would solve the Irish border issue  It is not going to come without strings attached   he said   The idea that we just get a customs arrangement without having to sign up to a raft of single market legislation is extremely unlikely  ImageThe Termon River  on the border of the Republic of Ireland  left  and Northern Ireland

0   put forward by a cross party group of Tory and Labour lawmakers  It would require Britain to remain a part of the bloc s single market  as well as in a customs union Often referred to as a  Norway style soft Brexit   it would mean accepting single market rules  but not require direct involvement in the quest for closer political union and agricultural policies It would  however  require Britain to accept freedom of movement between member states  perhaps the one thing above all that Mrs  May vowed to end in the Brexit process In the last round of votes  189 members of Parliament voted for the plan  while 283 voted against it  On Monday night  it was defeated more narrowly after the opposition Labour Party said it would whip its lawmakers to vote for the amendment What s likely to happen Your guess is as good as anyone s Getting out of the customs union was one of the red lines set by Mrs  May  who has said that Britain must have  new opportunities to trade with the rest the world  Agreeing to any  softening  in her Brexit stance is politically perilous  It may incite mass resignations by pro Brexit lawmakers in her cabinet  who have called the customs union and other similar proposals a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Tuesday lashed out at Puerto Rico s local lawmakers as  grossly incompetent  and singled out one of his favorite targets  Carmen Yulín Cruz  the mayor of San Juan  as  crazed and incompetent  Mr  Trump s latest invective toward the local leaders of an island devastated by a hurricane in September 2017 came in a torrent of tweets  which began on Monday night and spilled into Tuesday morning  Mr  Trump was reacting after the Senate on Monday blocked billions of dollars in disaster aid for Midwestern states  in part because Democrats said a proposed  600 million in nutritional assistance to Puerto Rico fell short of its needs  Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter  He also stated  incorrectly  that Puerto Rico had received  91 billion in aid from the federal government In fact  FEMA and other agencies have so far distributed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion in aid has been allocated  while  91 billion is the budget office s estimate of how much the island could receive over the next two decades Gov  Ricardo A  Rosselló of Puerto Rico  a Democrat  responded to Mr  Trump in a tweet of his own on Tuesday   Mr  President  once again  we are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Mr  Rosselló wrote Mr  Trump has long been sensitive when it comes to the subject of Puerto Rico  where the federal government s response to Hurricane Maria was widely criticized as too slow  Aides and allies said Mr  Trump had vented privately that Puerto Ricans had complained too much  and he had also noted privately that Hurricane Maria  which killed 2 975 people as a result of the storm and its effects  was not as bad as Hurricane Katrina  in which fewer people   1 833   were killed Mr  Trump has long hit back at Ms  Cruz  who during the disaster became the most outspoken critic of the federal response On Tuesday  Mr  Trump seemed to imply in his tweets that Puerto Rico was not part of the United States  noting that local elected officials  only take from USA   Hogan Gidley  a White House spokesman  seemed to underscore the view in the White House that Puerto Ricans were not Americans when he twice referred to the island as  that country  during an appearance on MSNBC Mr  Trump s apparent disdain for the island s leadership has led to a breakdown of communication between local officials and the White House For weeks  Mr  Rosselló has asked the White House for a private meeting with Mr  Trump to lay out the island s case for why it desperately needs federal funds for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria  But Mr  Rosselló s request has gone unanswered  and he has tried instead to communicate with the president publicly  saying in cable news interviews  in official appearances and on Twitter that he fears Mr  Trump has been misled about Puerto Rico s needs Mr  Rosselló s fight may be an uphill battle with a president who has made it clear that he views more federal aid to Puerto Rico as throwing money away  Mr  Trump s advisers also view the pleas from local officials as part of a campaign to shift the blame for what they view as severe mismanagement of the supplies and money sent after the storm People familiar with Mr  Trump s thinking said he was skeptical that additional aid would not be used to pay down Puerto Rico s debt  The acting White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  who has made it clear that he believes Puerto Rico will need to find its own way out of the debt crisis  is believed to be encouraging the president s negative view of the island In Puerto Rico  however  Mr  Trump s stance is being viewed through the lens of race  In an interview on Tuesday  Mr  Rosselló mentioned  unprompted  that Puerto Rico s population was almost entirely Latino and said that historically  there have been  ethnic undertones  to the treatment of Puerto Ricans by Washington   We don t want special treatment   he said   We just want equal treatment  The governor also has bigger issues to deal with at home  The resignations of two power players in his cabinet became public late on Monday  Julia Keleher  the education secretary  and Héctor M  Pesquera  the public safety secretary  had been among the least popular members of Mr  Rosselló s government  Their departures dominated the headlines in the local news media  which made little reference to what is widely seen here as yet another episode of presidential bluster That is not to say Puerto Ricans necessarily disagree with Mr  Trump s criticism of the commonwealth s leaders  even if many locals dislike the president himself  or the disdainful way he sometimes refers to the island  We have a political caste that is opportunistic and extremely corrupt   said Eduardo Lalo  a well known local novelist  humanities professor and opinion columnist who supports Puerto Rican independence   What the president says  of course it s clumsy and tremendously vulgar  and he says it for reasons of his own that are not substantive  But it s also objective  Image We are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Gov  Ricardo A  Rosselló of Puerto Rico said in a tweet to President Trump CreditThais Llorca EPA  via ShutterstockThe truth is  he said   Puerto Rico is a colony of the United States  and therefore its hands are completely tied  At a bakery in the comfortable San Juan neighborhood of Ocean Park on Tuesday  the morning crowd was hardly abuzz about Mr  Trump s comments  though people had noticed them One patron  Miguel Rodríguez  54  pulled out his cellphone to show how  moments earlier  a friend had posted on Facebook that she agreed with the president for the first time in praising Puerto Ricans but labeling their leaders  corrupt  Mr  Rodríguez  the owner of a company that installs security systems  scrolled down to the comment he left under his friend s post   We do not lack resources  we have too many thieves   The government wants to keep demanding money from the government of the United States   Mr  Rodríguez said   But much of that help doesn t reach the people  Politically  Mr  Rosselló is in an unenviable position experienced by all of his predecessors  Puerto Rico cannot get funding even for its food stamp program without approval from Congress  but it has no congressional representation to make its case in Washington   Representative Jenniffer González Colón  a Republican  has no vote in the House   None of the previous governors  however  had to deal with the dire consequences of a devastating hurricane in the middle of a government bankruptcy  Neither Trump nor any president of the United States nor any official in the United States has assumed the responsibility it has with Puerto Rico   Professor Lalo said   The great tragedy of the Puerto Rican people is that for 120 years  it calls Washington and no one picks up the phone  Mr  Rosselló  who is up for re election next year  has faced intense criticism on the island for trying to work cooperatively with Mr  Trump even as the president was repeatedly deriding Puerto Rican leaders Last week  the governor amped up his language against Mr  Trump  appearing to refer to him as a  bully  in an interview with CNN  If the bully gets close  I ll punch the bully in the mouth   he said   It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage  He later characterized his comments as a metaphor Mr  Trump has refrained from going after Mr  Rosselló by name  preferring to focus his attention Ms  Cruz  his political nemesis since her outspoken comments criticizing the Trump administration s failure to provide swift and meaningful help in the weeks after Hurricane Maria After Mr  Trump called Ms  Cruz  crazed and incompetent  on Twitter on Monday  she fired back  calling him  unhinged   He can huff   puff all he wants but he cannot escape the death of 3 000 on his watch   she wrote   SHAME ON YOU  Ms  Cruz recently declared her candidacy for governor  She and several other candidates are hoping to unseat Mr  Rosselló in 2020  He is a supporter of Puerto Rican statehood  she is not  When he doesn t get his way  he tries to pit people against each other   Ms  Cruz said of Mr  Trump in an interview on Tuesday   Three thousand people died under his watch and he has never acknowledged it  He s now trying to weaponize help   and  in his desperation  he s lying about it  Calling Puerto Rican leaders  corrupt  reflects poorly on Mr  Trump s own administration  she added  If he thinks that the money that has come to Puerto Rico is money that we shouldn t have received  then he doesn t trust FEMA   she said   He shows his inability to lead and that he is incapable of understanding how his own government works   

WASHINGTON   The  cooling saucer  of the United States Senate keeps going into the microwave For the third time in six years  the majority party in the Senate detonated the so called nuclear option on Wednesday to unilaterally change years old rules of the chamber with a simple majority vote  This time  to work through a backlog of President Trump s judicial and administration nominations  Republicans cut the time between ending debate and a final confirmation vote on executive branch nominees and district court judges from 30 hours to two The change was a provocative step that reignited a bitter partisan fight over presidential nominations that has raged for a decade and spanned presidencies from both parties  Democrats dwelled at length over the blockade that stopped Judge Merrick B  Garland from ascending to the Supreme Court in the final year of Barack Obama s presidency to angrily question how Republicans could complain about the handling of Mr  Trump s nominees  There s no other word but  hypocrisy    said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader The majority leader  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  justified his actions on the Garland nomination  saying Democrats would have done the same thing to a Republican Supreme Court nominee  And he said Democrats started the process in 2003  when they began routinely filibustering a Republican president s nominees Mr  McConnell s move on Wednesday was intended to break the Democratic blockade over dozens of judicial and sub cabinet nominations sent to the Senate by the Trump administration and to appease Mr  Trump  who has been badgering him to take such a step for months  We had hoped the Democrats would negotiate  but their base will roast them alive if they supported  a compromise deal unblocking Trump nominees  said Senator John Cornyn  Republican of Texas  who is a close ally of Mr  McConnell But the one party rule change   which followed maneuvers by Democrats in 2013 to end the 60 vote threshold for most judges and executive branch nominees  and by Republicans in 2017 to end the 60 vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees   knocked down another pillar of Senate custom that separated it from the majority rule House  And it took the chamber one step closer to ending the defining procedural bulwark of the Senate  the 60 vote requirement for moving ahead with most legislation  The Senate has changed so dramatically under McConnell s influence   said Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the second ranking Democrat in the upper chamber   He is corrupting the Senate into an institution that is more like the House of Lords than what the framers intended  We have walked away from amending  debating and legislating  Mr  Schumer declared it  a very sad day for the Senate  Mr  McConnell answered   This is not a sad day  this is a glad day   We know you don t like Donald Trump  but he won an election and he is entitled  to  set up  his government  he continued Under the new rules  the Senate approved the nomination of Jeffrey Kessler to be assistant secretary of commerce  It was then to approve Roy Kalman Altman to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Wednesday s rule change was not as sweeping as the 2013 move  made when Democrats controlled the chamber  to abolish the 60 vote threshold on most nominees  Nor was it as provocative as 2017  when the Republican majority extended that 51 vote confirmation threshold to the Supreme Court after Mr  McConnell spent most of 2016 blocking Judge Garland s nomination But Wednesday s precedent opens the way for Mr  McConnell to speed up the nominating process for sub cabinet level posts and Federal District Court judges  appointments that represent as many as 80 percent of administration nominees  Democrats say that by limiting the time between cutting off debate on a nominee and voting on final confirmation  the Senate loses time needed to vet nominees Senate Democrats   who have been marginalized by Mr  McConnell s hardball style of leadership   said Wednesday s move represented an attack on institutional norms put in place to ensure full debate For Mr  Trump  the change is long overdue  For more than a year the White House  spurred on by Mr  Trump and officials in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs  has prodded Mr  McConnell to invoke what has been referred to on Capitol Hill as a  mini  nuclear option But Mr  McConnell resisted  in part because of the opposition of two moderate Republicans  Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee Their opposition ebbed in recent weeks after sporadic talks overseen by Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer to unfreeze some of the nominations fell apart  Mr  Trump expressed his frustration over the logjam during his hourlong appearance at the Republicans  weekly lunch in the Capitol last week  This is crazy   he said  according to two people in the room   We have all these people  ambassadors  who have put their whole lives on hold  waiting to be confirmed A day later  Mr  McConnell  speaking at a second strategy lunch with his conference  blasted Mr  Schumer and claimed he was avoiding a compromise out of fear that he would be publicly attacked by liberals in his party He singled out Mr  Schumer s own former spokesman  Brian Fallon  who now leads a progressive coalition that lobbies against the appointment of conservative judges  Chuck won t make a deal because he s afraid of Brian Fallon   Mr  McConnell said  according to a person familiar with his remarks Mr  Fallon did not respond to a request for comment  The only thing stopping a deal is Senator Mitch McConnell  because Senator McConnell wants to change the rules   said Justin Goodman  Mr  Schumer s current spokesman Mr  Schumer has privately expressed frustration with his recent interactions with Mr  McConnell  particularly the majority leader s unwillingness to even consider a separate deal for nonjudicial appointments  In a recent leadership meeting  Mr  Schumer complained that Mr  McConnell was offering him a deal that  chopped off four fingers  as opposed to cutting off his whole hand  Senate Democratic aides said Every Senate Democrat voted against the rule change on Wednesday  Two Republican senators  Mike Lee of Utah and Ms  Collins  also opposed it  The Senate s rules protect the rights of the American people by balancing the competing interests of majorities  minorities and individual senators   Mr  Lee said The actual nominations were less controversial than the rule  and a handful of Democrats crossed the aisle to vote for Mr  Altman Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer  who bear no great affection for each other  engaged in an uncommonly emotional duel on the Senate floor   holding in rapt attention two dozen senators who  in near unison  deposited their iPhones on their desks or laps to watch At one point  Mr  Schumer  speaking from a prepared text  turned to confront Mr  McConnell directly  accusing the leader of abusing  the brute power of the majority  to push the change  I m sorry my Republican colleagues have gone along with Senator McConnell s debasement of the Senate   he said Mr  McConnell sat impassively at his desk a few feet away as Mr  Schumer spoke  He stared down at the carpet and fussed with his shirt cuffs  wearing a wry  mocking grin When he stood to defend himself  his face betrayed the strain  gradually reddening into a crimson blush that spanned from cheekbone to jaw  as he accused Democrats  under the leadership of  a fella named Chuck Schumer   for weaponizing the filibuster over the past 15 years  He started the whole thing   Mr  McConnell said  turning to face Mr  Schumer  

WASHINGTON   The Democratic head of a powerful U S  House committee asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of President Donald Trump s personal and business tax returns on Wednesday  in a long awaited move widely expected to lead to a long court battle with the White House The request  in a letter from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig  is viewed by Democrats in the House of Representatives as a vital first step toward oversight of Trump s income taxes and business network  which some lawmakers believe could be rife with conflicts of interest and potential tax law violations  It is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials  To maintain trust in our democracy  the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly  as laws intend   Neal said in a statement IRS and U S  Treasury officials were not immediately available for comment Trump defied decades of precedent as a presidential candidate by refusing to release the tax documents and has continued to keep them under wraps as president  saying his returns were  under audit  by the IRS  Trump s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recently testified in Congress that he did not believe the president was being audited but may have used the audit claim to avoid scrutiny that could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties  Trump was dismissive of the request but continued to make the audit argument in comments to reporters during a meeting with U S  military leaders on Wednesday   Is that all   the president asked when told Democrats wanted to see six years of his returns   Usually it s 10  so I guess they re giving up   he said   I ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name  you re audited  But until such time as I m not under audit  I would not be inclined to do that   Neal based his request on his committee s oversight jurisdiction of the IRS  specifically its alleged audits of Trump and the extent to which the agency has enforced the tax laws against the president  OVERSIGHT PRESSURECongressional Republicans oppose Neal s effort  saying such a move sets a dangerous precedent by turning the confidential tax documents of a U S  citizen into a political weapon  This particular request is an abuse of the tax writing committees  statutory authority and violates the intent and safeguards of     the Internal Revenue Code   Representative Kevin Brady  the committee s top Republican  said in a statement Independent analysts welcomed the move   The Ways and Means Committee s strongest oversight ability is making sure the IRS is operating properly   said Steve Rosenthal  a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank in Washington  It was the third time this week a Democratic led House committee exerted oversight pressure on Trump  Earlier on Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee authorized its chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full investigation report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed a former White House security chief on Tuesday Neal s committee initially planned to request only Trump s personal tax returns  But some Democrats and independent analysts pressed for them to include business returns to better gauge the president s activity in the private sector  The request includes returns for eight entities  Donald J Trump Revocable Trust  DJT Holdings LLC  DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC  DTTM Operations LLC  DTTM Operations Managing Member Corp  LFB Acquisition Member Corp  LFB Acquisition LLC and Trump National Golf Club A Democratic aide said the committee selected a manageable number of business entities that provide a vital window on Trump s business activity  Although Trump has never released his returns  the New York Times last year cited a  vast trove  of returns and financial records saying it showed he engaged in tax schemes including cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions of dollars in taxes  The White House called the report misleading    Reporting by David Morgan  Doina Chiacu and Alexandra Alper  Editing by Peter Cooney and G Crosse  

WASHINGTON   The U S  and China opened a ninth round of talks Wednesday  aiming to further narrow differences in an ongoing trade war that has deepened uncertainty for businesses and investors and cast a pall over the outlook for the global economy The latest negotiating session on American soil follows a similar set of talks held last week in Beijing Larry Kudlow  a top White House economic adviser  said  good headway  was made when U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met in the Chinese capital with a delegation headed by Vice Premier Liu He  a confidant of President Xi Jinping Kudlow expressed optimism that the parties would narrow the areas of disagreement further this week  They ll be here for three days  maybe more   he told reporters at a roundtable sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor Others said they ve been encouraged by the tone of the negotiations thus far Myron Brilliant  head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  estimated Tuesday that the two sides are 90  of the way to an agreement but cautioned that  the last 10  is the hardest part  the trickiest part  At the heart of the dispute are the Trump administration s allegations that China steals technology and coerces U S  companies to hand over trade secrets   all part of Beijing s zeal to overtake U S  technological dominance  To pressure China  the United States has imposed tariffs on  250 billion in Chinese goods  The Chinese have counterpunched by taxing  110 billion in U S  imports Forecasters at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  among others  have downgraded their outlook for the global economy  partly because the U S  China rift is damaging trade and causing businesses to slow investment until they know how the dispute will end Tensions have eased somewhat since President Donald Trump and Xi met in Buenos Aires late last year and the administration ended up suspending its plans to raise tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese imports to buy time for negotiations Kudlow said the talks are covering a host of issues that the two sides  have never really covered before  and that progress was being made on all fronts   which is the assessment administration officials from Trump on down have been making publicly for weeks  We re not there yet and we hope this week we get closer   Kudlow said Analysts say two major sticking points  in particular  stand in the way of any agreement First  Trump wants to preserve at least the 25  tariffs he has imposed on  50 billion in Chinese imports as a way to maintain leverage over Beijing  China wants them lifted Second  the two sides must develop a mechanism to ensure that China honors any commitments it makes in an agreement  The administration complains that China has repeatedly failed to keep promises it made in previous trade talks The Chinese are widely expected to agree to buy substantially more American products   likely including soybeans and natural gas   to help narrow the United States  trade deficit in goods and services with China  which hit a record  379 billion last year  America s trade deficit with China has been one of Trump s chronic complaints  although many economists say a bilateral trade gap is relatively insignificant Congressional Democrats and others have warned Trump against reaching any agreement that settles for more U S  exports to China without also requiring Beijing to adopt serious economic reforms  Stand firm   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y   said Tuesday   Skip the political photo op and make good on your promise to stand up for American businesses and workers when China takes advantage  Christopher Adams  a former China specialist at the Treasury Department and the Office of the U S  Trade Representative who is a senior adviser at the Covington   Burling law firm  added   There has to be something substantive on the structural issues  Otherwise  the criticism will be severe  Whatever negotiators agree to  analysts say  they are unlikely to end the long standing tensions between America s mostly open  capitalist economy and a Chinese economy in which the Communist Party and the central government command the dominant role Even with a deal  Adams said   a lot of the underlying issues will still be with us unresolved because they re rooted in fundamental differences between the U S  and Chinese systems     Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report  

ImageAlaa Abd El Fattah speaking at a conference in Cairo in 2015  The Egyptian blogger was freed last week after five years in prison CreditNariman El Mofty Associated PressCAIRO   We woke to the news last Friday  The 37 year old software developer and pro democracy activist Alaa Abd El Fattah had finally been released from prison  after completing a five year sentence for having called for street protests in defiance of the law   Alaa is out  Yes  I swear   tweeted his sister  Mona Seif  in Arabic  Not long after  she shared a blurry photo of him  sitting on a rattan chair at their family home  playing with their dog  Next came a photo of Alaa sitting with his now seven year old son and holding the boy s little feet It wasn t Alaa s  first arrest  but his seventh  and longest  under four governments In May 2006  under the reign of President Hosni Mubarak  Alaa was arrested during a peaceful protest calling for an independent judiciary  and released six weeks later In 2011  under the transitional rule of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces  he was arrested on charges of inciting aggression during bloody clashes opposing Coptic Christian protesters and riot police and thugs  He was released after two months On the night of March 26  2013  under the rule of the Islamist President Mohamed Morsi  Alaa was accused of inciting  aggression  during a protest outside the Muslim Brotherhood s headquarters  He was arrested and released the following day Two days later  he was arrested again  charged with having set fire the previous year to the headquarters of the then presidential candidate Ahmed Shafik  He was handed a one year suspended sentence In November 2013  he was arrested yet again  for protesting  in defiance of an anti protest law  against military trials for civilians  for rioting and for attacking public servants He was released on bail in March 2014   and rearrested on the same charges that June after being sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison  During a retrial in September of that year   an obligatory procedure for defendants sentenced in absentia   Alaa was released on bail  The presiding judge stepped down mid trial saying that the prosecution had obtained evidence illegally The following February  in 2015  he was arrested again  and handed the five year sentence he just completed During one of the times that Alaa was in prison  his first child was born  during another  his father died His father was the prominent human rights lawyer Ahmed Seif El Islam Hamed  His sisters   Mona and Sanaa Seif   are both staunch activists  And his mother  Laila Soueif  is perhaps Egypt s most recognizable face of the left Of my many memories from the uprising of 2011  one of the most precious was finding Ahmed and Laila  sitting hand in hand one afternoon on a ledge in Tahrir Square  Alaa stood over them talking and laughing  a water bottle in hand  Mona and Sanaa were not far away  giving out fliers A lot has changed during the five years that Alaa was in prison  Many people we know in common have left the country  as immigrants or asylum seekers  Activists  journalists and human rights defenders have been put in jail or disappeared  Some have been released  Friends have had breakdowns  An activist couple who met in Tahrir Square have married and had their first child  But an Italian student and researcher was brutally murdered  found dead on the side of a street with torture marks   that fact lingers  The cost of living also has shot up  after the government lifted fuel subsidies and floated the Egyptian pound to save itself from debt As we lived our lives on the outside  in relative freedom  we never forgot Alaa   the hashtag  freealaa was sustained  And yet at some point we began to fail him I couldn t forget how the protests calling for Alaa s freedom started out sizable in the initial weeks  even months  of his detention  and then slowly began to shrink  I remember the day that I found myself not responding to such a call and followed the gathering on Twitter instead   on the streets  were just a handful of supporters  headed by Alaa s ever stoic mother I began to question my lack of political stamina  my will  my occasional paralysis over even writing  and was riddled with a sense of defeat  It was perhaps my guilt that caused me to work a character inspired by Alaa  Dido  into my novel  By the end of the book  Dido is in prison  and he says to his writer cousin that he doesn t blame her for not making activism her life  telling her that it doesn t take an entire population to change the course of things and that everyone has his and her own calling In a letter from 2016  Alaa wrote   I spent most of 2014 in prison yet I still had lots of words   And then  a few lines later  But by early 2015  as I heard my sentence  I had nothing left to say to any public  I could only write personal letters  The revolution and  indeed Egypt itself  would slowly fade out even from those letters  and by fall 2015  even my personal words dried up  It s been months since I wrote a letter and more than a year since I ve written an article  I have nothing to say  no hopes  no dreams  no fears  no warnings  no insights  nothing  absolutely nothing  Alaa is out of prison now  but that doesn t mean he s free  For the next five years of his life  he will be under surveillance and will have to report to a local police station every evening at six and spend his nights there I think Laila and Mona spent all of Alaa s first night out but back in sitting on the pavement outside the station  reading and waiting for him to emerge at dawn  Knowing them  they might do the same for the next five years On Saturday  the second afternoon of his partial freedom  Alaa wrote on Twitter   I am the poison  I am the antidote  I am the medicine  I am the sickness  I am the ghost of the Spring past  With the most visible face of the revolution now free  and against the backdrop of ongoing protests in Algeria  I find myself reflecting on what has gone wrong for Egypt since 2011  Our broader failing was less about what we wanted    bread  freedom and social justice    than how we thought we could get there  A national referendum to amend the Constitution looms  and it might dictate the course of the country for the next 15 years  And so it seems like it s time to regroup and devise a common political strategy  knowing that our political goals remain the same  a freer  fairer Egypt  in which we can express ourselves without fear of persecution The Times is

This week it s Joe Biden s turn in the  MeToo barrel  and like many Democrats  I m torn about what to think  The allegations by Lucy Flores   that in 2014  when she was running for lieutenant governor of Nevada  the vice president touched her shoulders  and kissed the back of her head   cannot exactly be dismissed as an outlier  given that another allegation of guerrilla nuzzling followed just 72 hours later  this time from 2009   and that multiple photo montages online suggest a similar pattern And so we have another debate about male decency and respect  trying to weigh creepiness against over exuberant affection  handsiness against glad handing  all the while remembering that this is Joe Biden we re talking about  a retail politics guy from another era  known for arm grabs and bear hugs  you d see this all the time on the Senate floor   the shoulder squeezing  the close talking   He is  by nature  a physically expressive fellow  Hugs are not unfamiliar to him  and he seems to sense when people are feeling fragile  as Stephanie Carter  the wife of Ash Carter  a defense secretary under Barack Obama  wrote in an essay for Medium  noting that the  creepy Uncle Joe  photo featuring her as the recipient of a shoulder rub was quite welcome  thank you very much These gray zone allegations are of course still worth examining  But because they are salacious   because they are embodied  because we can actually see them   I wonder if we spend more time discussing them than another gray zone problem that  in my view  is far more pervasive and often less easily solved with a sharp rebuke or a complaint to human resources  not being taken seriously Because here s the truth  Some of the women I know have  MeToo stories  But most of the women I know have stories about feeling dismissed  invisible  less than What are they talking about  They re talking about seeing their ideas gain traction in a meeting only after a man has said them  Or being told after they ve asserted themselves in a meeting that they dominated it   or at the least talked too much They re talking about seeing weeks or months of work being casually dismissed by their superior after he s had a 10 minute conversation with a male colleague They re talking about being mansplained Personally  I ve been mansplained about my own book  And about Congress  which I covered on and off for 20 years  You know what didn t help  Saying Hey  I wrote a book about that  Or Hey  I started my career at The Hill They re talking about contradicting a male colleague and watching him get really mad They re talking about being called boastful when they re invoking a necessary credential They re talking about having their recollections dismissed until they re Googled They re talking about being given soft or detail oriented responsibilities while the fellas are delegated the big think They re talking about chatting with another woman and a male colleague walks by   Planning a rebellion   he asks   That  admittedly  happened early in the careers of most of the women I have talked to  Have men stopped doing that  I wonder   Maybe  Hopefully  Probably not   Many of these problems are happening in organizations with supposed enlightened politics  They can still have feudal habits Note what I m not mentioning  Ambition   pushiness  Too obvious Or the motherhood penalty Or a national policy that guarantees only three months off with a newborn  unpaid  if you re lucky enough to work for an organization to which the Family and Medical Leave Act applies Or that we have no subsidized child care  and often get looked at as if we re nuts if we ask for reimbursement for it when we work extra hours Younger women sometimes look at women of my generation   I m 49   and wonder why we may be a little wearier  a little warier  a little less noisy  But it s not  I don t think  a matter of false consciousness  or that we don t know our rights  nor is it that we re resentful about having had to swallow our own stories as we were coming of age   Even ancient infractions of a minor variety are  in this climate  the functional equivalent of a loaded gun  It s that some of the more ambiguous  MeToo experiences might seem more manageable  or maybe just more ridiculous   and certainly less insidious   than the subtler biases many of us have faced in how men think  They re about an attitude  A mind set  hiding in plain sight Sometimes the two are connected  It can be a short leap from taking physical liberties with a woman  even if they re minor  even if they re done out of sheer obliviousness  to dismissing her ideas  Both involve a certain inability to see Maybe my younger peers have been fortunate enough to see most of these behaviors melt away  But I suspect they haven t  and they  too  deserve our attention  maybe their own hashtag  I don t care what it is  just so long as they re discussed  They re common  They re powerful  They re corrosive and confidence pulverizing  They re every bit as real more on joe bidenOpinion   Ross Douthat  The Real Joe Biden DecisionApril 2  2019Opinion   Michael Tomasky  The Biden Paradox  and How to Solve ItMarch 12

This article is part of David Leonhardt s newsletter  You can sign up here to receive it each weekday Over the weekend  my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick and I went looking for articles arguing both sides of the Joe Biden question  We found numerous pieces upbraiding Biden for touching people while interacting with them  and several of them argued that his likely presidential campaign should suffer for it Finding articles making the opposite case wasn t so easy   The closest we came was a Medium essay by Stephanie Carter  whose husband served in the Obama administration with Biden   But if the media consensus this weekend was a condemnation of Biden  the reaction on Monday   both in the media and among readers   was different  It was substantially more mixed and less negative You can see some of that view in the letters that The Times received from readers   Men were acculturated to behave in ways that ignored the sensibilities of women  and that is no longer acceptable   Laura Petiford wrote   I   struggle to understand how it is helpful to render men like Mr  Biden  unfit  because of behaviors that were so deeply woven into the social fabric of this country that we are only now beginning to address them contextually   Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Susannah Sard wrote   Sometimes we need to relax   Richard Brandshaft wrote   Yet again the proverbial liberal circular firing squad   And Eileen West wrote   Joe Biden has plenty to answer for  especially his treatment of Anita Hill  Let his challengers question him on that  rather than being distracted by the media frenzy of the day  The strongest reaction I saw came from Theda Skocpol  a Harvard political scientist whom I ve quoted before in this newsletter  She has spent years studying the Tea Party  the Obama presidency and the Trump resistance  I m going to turn over most of the rest of the newsletter to her  by reprinting an email she sent me And my own view  I m still thinking it through  As I said yesterday  Biden s  handsiness  is a bit strange  I ve interviewed other politicians who touched me repeatedly during the conversation  and it was unnecessary   I hope Biden understands why the habit makes some people uncomfortable  But I m increasingly thinking that it should not become a defining issue for his likely campaign  Wait a minute Theda Skocpol writes The piling on about Joe Biden s sometimes unwanted affectionate touches by political competitors and media outlets is shameful  Both women who have come forward so far are not talking about workplace abuse or sexual misconduct  I can believe them  and still ask why they are speaking up now  One person  who has supported a political competitor to Biden  acknowledges that she is speaking because Biden is considering entering the primaries  the other says that if Biden really respects women  he should not run and clear the field for the capable women candidates  Wait a minute  Is this what gender equality really means  Is this the kind of society we want to live in   where right wingers can do any vicious thing they want to anyone and shrug it off  while people on the center left are supposed to expel from public life anyone who says a single wrong word or has done something benignly intended in the past that now does not fit changed norms  Not me  that is not the kind of America I want to live in  That is not the kind of Democratic primary I want to participate in  If Biden wants to run  I want to hear what he has to say and compare him  fair and square  to the others Biden has long been known as an emotional person who hugs just about everyone he feels positively about  male and female  Now the social mores have shifted  He needs to say he realizes this and change his behavior accordingly  Everyone else  meanwhile  needs to get a grip  Anyone who experiences an unwanted word or gesture should tell the person involved that they would like them not to say do that   not wait a decade and contact the media in an expedient moment  And Democrats must keep in mind that they need votes in 2020 from millions of older Americans who are really put off by this kind of out of context piling on  End of Skocpol s email  For more   Joe Biden needs to cut it out  And so does the mob that is after him   Karen Tumulty writes in The Washington Post My colleague Michelle Goldberg says that this is the wrong time for Biden to run and criticizes his reaction to this controversy  In response to Lucy Flores s description of his touching   Biden could have told her that he was sorry for making her uneasy  Instead  he focused on his intentions rather than her experience  a faint echo of the way he d ignored  Anita  Hill s experience decades ago  Ross Douthat argues that the episode highlights a choice Biden will need to make  Whether to run a campaign in which he is constantly apologizing  and likely losing  or trying to appeal proactively to the large group of Democrats who like him    a mix of older white Democrats  culturally moderate African Americans and Hispanics  and anti Trump suburbanites   And  yes  Michelle  Ross and I will be debating about Biden on this week s episode of  The Argument   which will be out on Thursday  If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter  you

The Trump administration s decision to cut off aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras to punish their governments for failing to curb migration is a rash response to a real policy dilemma  Cutting off aid will needlessly deepen tensions between Congress and the administration  and it will exacerbate migration from the region without twisting Central American politicians  arms  But we shouldn t pretend that the aid itself was doing much good   in fact  the best move right now would be to significantly change the way aid to Central America is structured  to push those countries to alleviate the political  economic and social pressures driving people north in the first place Immigration fueled tensions between Congress and the White House are likely to reach a new high as a result of the decision to cut off aid to Central America  The president s declaration of a state of emergency to build his wall already triggered a battle over the power to legislate  that fight will now grow to include the power of the purse  The potential cost is greater than heightened acrimony  As each side will surely dig in its heels  sensible immigration and foreign policies  such as bipartisan efforts to address the rising number of asylum seekers or to prevent Guatemala from sliding into authoritarianism  will get lost in the scuffle The decision to cut off aid is bound to drive up migration numbers  American aid to Central America has a lot of problems  Its total amounts are paltry  and it is mostly distributed inefficiently in large blocks by foreign contractors  Nonetheless  that aid is about the only outside support available to Central American governments confronting relentless poverty and violence  And some of the aid does work  There is good evidence that violence prevention assistance to El Salvador has contributed to a decrease in the homicide rate  a likely factor behind the drop in migration to the United States ImagePeople waiting at the border crossing in Nuevo Laredo  Mexico  to apply for asylum sometimes stay at this overcrowded migrant shelter for weeks  even months CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesCutting off foreign assistance is unlikely to persuade Central American governments to take actions that reduce the migratory flow  The amount of aid provided pales in comparison with revenue accrued through migrant remittances  The  500 million sent to these countries in 2017 was less than 3 percent of the money received as remittance each year  And as Venezuela has shown  the United States isn t the only source of support   Mr  Trump s aid cutoff simply opens the door for China or Russia  Governments of the region  especially of Guatemala and  to a lesser degree  of Honduras  are indifferent to the plight of their poor who migrate  Especially as these governments turn increasingly authoritarian and criminal  they are more than happy to rid their countries of real and prospective opponents  For too long  Central American governments and elites have gotten away with abdicating their fiduciary  social and legal responsibilities to their citizens  They have failed to collect tax revenue and to invest in social programs and job creation that alleviate the plight of their poor  And they have aligned themselves with vast organized criminal networks  These networks  acting either independently or in alliance with increasingly sophisticated gangs  are responsible for terrorizing community members into fleeing their countries and for transforming migration into a lucrative criminal enterprise If the Trump administration is serious about forcing the hand of Central American governments  it can t just cut off aid   an alternative policy approach is urgently required  Rather than turn a blind eye to creeping authoritarianism  it should pressure governments to become more democratic and less beholden to corrupt elites and criminal networks ImageEl Salvador s president elect  Nayib Bukele  at the Heritage Foundation in Washington in March CreditEric Baradat Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThere could not be a more opportune or urgent moment to do so  particularly in El Salvador and Guatemala  Mr  Trump should reach out to the Salvadoran president elect  Nayib Bukele  and help him make good on his campaign promise to ensure transparency by establishing a commission to investigate corruption and criminality  Timing is even more critical in Guatemala  Congress has already pushed the country s government to improve accountability by revoking the visas of corrupt public officials and business people  The administration should embrace and further these efforts  especially in the run up to elections this year  in which several factions are trying to block the candidacy of Thelma Aldana  a crusading former attorney general  for president In all of these cases  American aid can be used both as a carrot to promote reform and as a support mechanism to help politicians like Ms  Aldana achieve needed reform  As sometimes happens with this administration  Mr  Trump is half right  American aid is not working  and Central American governments need to be called to account for their mismanagement  But ending that aid will just make everything worse  Instead of being a giveaway  it needs to be structured as an incentive for domestic reform  Not only will that cut down on migration  but it will help give Central Americans what they have been longing for  a safe and prosperous region where they can imagine a future for their children Read moreOpinion articles on

A second woman on Monday accused Joseph R  Biden Jr  of touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable  intensifying the scrutiny of the former vice president s close physical interactions with women over the years as he prepares for a likely presidential bid The woman  Amy Lappos  said in an interview with The Hartford Courant that Mr  Biden  put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me  at a fund raiser in Connecticut in 2009  When he was pulling me in  I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth   she said in the interview  She said the encounter  wasn t sexual  but that there was  a line of respect   and Mr  Biden had crossed it  Joe Biden s hugs and kisses were well known in Washington  Now he faces a generational reckoning  Her allegations follow a weekend in which Mr  Biden defended himself against a similar complaint from a former Nevada assemblywoman  Lucy Flores  who said in an essay published on Friday that the former vice president had touched and kissed her inappropriately at a campaign event in 2014 In a statement late Monday that Ms  Lappos sent to The New York Times  she said she was speaking out because she was disappointed in the way Ms  Flores has been treated in the aftermath of her allegations   Uninvited affection is not okay  Objectifying women is not okay    Ms  Lappos said  Referring to this type of behavior as  simply affection  or  grandpa like  or  friendly  is ridiculously dismissive and part of the problem    she said in the statement   Saying  but Trump    is dangerous and sets the bar for Democratic men far below where it should be  Mr  Biden s team had already issued two statements trying to contain the damage  Earlier Monday  his spokesman  Bill Russo  sent a third  lengthy email to reporters criticizing what he said were misrepresentations of Mr  Biden s past behavior  and seeking to link some of the attacks on him to Republicans Mr  Russo cited an image of Mr  Biden holding the shoulders of Stephanie Carter  the wife of former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter  and another of Mr  Biden kissing the head of Senator Chris Coons s daughter  arguing that the criticism of the former vice president was rooted in inaccurate assumptions about what was occurring in the pictures Both Ms  Carter and Mr  Coons s young daughter welcomed Mr  Biden s embrace  Mr  Russo said  pointing to a Medium post Ms  Carter wrote and comments Mr  Coons made about how close his family is to the Bidens But Mr  Biden s team of advisers is preparing for more criticism about his past behavior  acknowledging that  given Mr  Biden s nearly 50 year career in politics  it s inevitable that others will come forward to say he made them feel uncomfortable Mr  Russo pointed out that much of the criticism about Mr  Biden s conduct has come from Republicans and that some of it has been manufactured entirely The aide pointed to photoshopped images  including one in which Mr  Biden is portrayed touching Ms  Carter s breast  and another cropped photo of the former vice president comforting his grandson at the funeral of his son  Beau   which he called  most galling of all    These smears and forgeries have existed in the dark recesses of the internet for a while   Mr  Russo said   To this day  right wing trolls and others continue to exploit them for their own gain   he added  warning against a  cottage industry of lies  On Monday  the Drudge Report posted a collage of Biden photographs  including one that photoshopped him standing behind a crying piccolo player in the Villanova University band  a widely shared image from the 2015 N C A A  basketball tournament Mr  Biden s advisers believe that the more the right pushes images of him  real or fake  the more it will help them persuade Democrats that Republicans are trying to derail a potential challenger who performs best in polls against President Trump  The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because the former vice president is not yet in the race But Mr  Biden s inner circle is also deeply suspicious about the timing of Ms  Flores s criticism  believing it s part of a larger effort by hostile Democrats to undermine the former vice president s candidacy before he even announces  the advisers said The aggressive response by Mr  Biden s aides represents the latest indication of what they said over the weekend  that he will not be dissuaded by the allegations from entering the presidential race The challenge for Mr  Biden now  though  is that Ms  Flores is no longer alone in speaking out In her interview with The Courant  Ms  Lappos said the encounter that made her uncomfortable occurred at a fund raiser in 2009  when she was working as a congressional aide to Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut  There s absolutely a line of decency   she told The Courant   There s a line of respect  Crossing that line is not grandfatherly  It s not cultural  It s not affection  It s sexism or misogyny  She said she  never filed a complaint  to be honest  because he was the vice president  I was a nobody  The office of Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut confirmed Monday that the event described in the Courant article took place and that Mr  Murphy  who was a congressman at the time  attended it The recent scrutiny of Mr  Biden s physical behavior began on Friday when Ms  Flores  a Democrat  published an essay in New York Magazine s The Cut  which described an encounter with Mr  Biden in 2014 that she described as mortifying In the essay  she wrote that Mr  Biden had come to a rally to help her fledgling campaign for lieutenant governor of Nevada and had come up behind her  touched her and planted  a big slow kiss  on the back of her head  Mr  Biden  in a statement Friday  said he did not believe he acted inappropriately  but pledged to listen to any accuser Since the essay published  Ms  Flores  39  has praised Mr  Biden for being willing to listen to concerns and clarify his intentions  But she has said she finds it hard to believe that Mr  Biden could not have been aware of how he made her and other women feel and has called his behavior  completely inappropriate

WASHINGTON    Not any longer  And with that  a triumphant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to close the book Tuesday on a divisive Republican debate  convincing President Donald Trump to shelve plans to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters It was a rare public disclosure of private counsel from the Republican leader  And it signaled that  after two years in Trump s Washington  Republicans on Capitol Hill are figuring out how to handle the president and his impulsive swerves on policy Trump insisted Tuesday it was his idea to switch course  I wanted to delay it myself   Trump said during an event at the White House   I want to put it after the election  Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week  backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   he said Speaking later Tuesday at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump said   Republicans should not run away from health care      If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose  Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  The president stunned Republicans last week by announcing he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  insisting the GOP could become the  party of health care   Republicans wanted no part of a do over after their failure to replace the law in 2017  Facing a revolt from the ranks  McConnell told the president he needed him to listen  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Several times McConnell told Trump to listen  the person said  And it worked  Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much  So we don t have a misunderstanding about that   McConnell said Tuesday Trump s shift   he tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections  when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House    made clear that the health care debate will be left for voters to decide during the race for the White House That arrangement suits Democrats just fine  They are denouncing Trump s attempt to overturn the ACA in court and floating various health care plans  including an expansion of government funded Medicare with so called  Medicare for All   setting up a stark contrast between the parties for the campaign trail Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will  hold Americans hostage through 2020  on an issue that affects millions of people  He said that Trump  insists he has a magic plan that we can see if only the American people re elect him  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats  health care battle with Trump is  a values fight  After Trump dropped the issue on Republicans last week  many hoped it would just go away  They had no comprehensive proposal to replace the ACA law and no big plans to unveil one  Publicly and privately  Republicans tried to talk to Trump McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking Rep  Mark Meadows  R N C   a Trump confidant  called shifting the debate to 2021  a very pragmatic decision   He said Tuesday that  spending quality time to develop a comprehensive strategy  would be  critical  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s 2010 health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017 when Republicans controlled both chambers in Congress  He still blames the late Sen  John McCain for joining other senators to oppose a last ditch plan While Republicans gained Senate seats last fall  GOP senators   particularly those up for re election next year   weren t looking for another fight over the law  They saw how the issue played in 2018  when Democrats made it the cornerstone of their successful drive to win back the House Preserving health care protections  and especially for people with pre existing conditions  resonates with voters  According to AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide  nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care at the top of a list of key issues As Democrats have blamed Republicans for trying to end the ACA  GOP backed challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts Last week  the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down  an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured In his late Monday tweets  Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that  will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America  Republicans appeared relieved that  for now  that battle will be fought during the campaign  rather than in Congress The No  2 Senate Republican  John Thune of South Dakota  said the president  has some big ideas and  to his credit  wants to solve problems   But Thune said   you run into that wall of reality   of a divided Congress with Democrats in control of the House  which requires bipartisanship  Trying to convey what the obstacles are to getting what he wants to get done in the next two years is something I think a number of our members conveyed to him   Thune said    Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram  Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar  Darlene Superville and Kevin Freking contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Monday hosted about 300 guests  including convicted felons  at the White House for the  First Step Act Celebration   a party intended to bring attention to a rare piece of bipartisan legislation he passed last year  and which he plans to highlight on the campaign trail The East Room celebration capped a day of events dedicated to overhauling the criminal justice system  an issue that agencies across the government have been asked to elevate The labor secretary  Alexander Acosta  participated in a panel on work force development  Ben Carson  the secretary of Housing and Urban Development  led a session about prisoner re entry  Ivanka Trump  the president s daughter and senior adviser  weighed in at a session dealing with incarcerated women  Kim Kardashian  the reality TV star  was even invited to participate in the panels and the party  but could not attend Months after the legislation passed  and amid foreign policy blunders and a defeat on funding a wall along the southern border  Mr  Trump s administration is putting the issue front and center  As president  I pledged to work with both parties for the good of the whole nation   Mr  Trump said at the East Room gathering  pointing to the legislation as an example of bipartisan work that he said was  so important to me  But some activists who helped work on the legislation   which would expand job training and early release programs  and modify sentencing laws  including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders   have expressed concern that Mr  Trump is more attuned to the political opportunities the law offers him  rather than with ensuring it is enacted effectively Mr  Trump s budget  released last month  listed only  14 million to pay for the First Step Act s programs  The law passed in December specifically asked for  75 million a year for five years  beginning in 2019  The funding gap was first reported by The Marshall Project The Office of Management and Budget  however  noted that the bill passed after the budget had already been finalized and that there was always an understanding that funding for the First Step Act would be revisited  On Monday night  Mr  Trump said that  my administration intends to fully fund and implement this historic law   It was the line that many concerned advocates had been hoping to hear  The answer is a resounding yes  We re fully committed to doing that   Ja Ron Smith  a White House adviser who has worked extensively on putting the First Step Act in place  said in an interview  referring to the funding In a budget justification document  the Bureau of Prisons  which operates under the Justice Department  said that it had not concluded how much money would be required to put the First Step Act into effect  But it went on to say that fulfilling the law was a  priority  and that the Bureau of Prisons  budget for re entry activities  will be prioritized to fully fund the requirements of the act  The document also noted that the prison bureau planned to dedicate  147 million in the 2020 fiscal year to First Step Act related activities  which include the cost of expanding halfway housing  the cost to relocate people and  85 million for the Second Chance Act grant program  which aids states and nonprofits in reducing recidivism Despite the assurances from the president on down that the changes remain a budget priority  questions about funding have advocates on the issue concerned and keeping up public pressure  The First Step Act cannot fulfill its promise of turning federal prisons toward rehabilitation and preparing men and women to come home job ready if it is not fully funded   said Jessica Jackson Sloan  national director of  Cut50  a prisoner advocacy group that worked closely with the White House to get the legislation passed  Ms  Sloan said the group had been meeting with appropriators and talking to White House officials for months  to ensure that the proper funding is requested and appropriated  Others who have worked on the issue said it still remained to be seen whether the White House would push for full funding when it comes time to work out appropriations in a spending bill  and whether there would be an effort to make the Justice Department comply with it  I hope that the president s budget has been amended to specifically fund First Step  but there is so much that needs to be done after that   said Holly Harris  the executive director of Justice Action Network  which has worked with a bipartisan group on criminal justice overhaul efforts   We need the president to lean in hard on his allies in Congress  Ms  Harris noted that her group continued  to be skeptical  that officials at the Justice Department would prioritize the issue  It was not a priority for Jeff Sessions  the first attorney general in the Trump administration  who fought Jared Kushner  the president s son in law  on making it one  But his successor  William P  Barr  said in his confirmation hearing that he would fully carry out and support the law  Mr  Barr has also met with Mr  Kushner at the White House and understands that it is a priority for top officials  White House officials said Mr  Kushner helped persuade the president to get behind the prison reform measure last year  by assuring him that it had the backing of conservatives and that it was also popular with African American voters  whose support for the president was anemic in his 2016 campaign At a campaign rally in Grand Rapids  Mich   last week  Mr  Trump described the First Step Act as legislation that politicians had been trying to do  for so many years  He added a dig at his opposition   While we are pushing and pursuing all of these common sense policies to advance the common good for our citizens  Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism  resistance and revenge  The kickoff party on Monday offered Mr  Trump an opportunity for a photo op with the convicted felons  many of whom were African American  as his campaign advisers want him to expand his appeal beyond his base  Mr  Trump called many of the First Step Act beneficiaries up to the microphone to speak  where they grew emotional and thanked him for signing the legislation Many Democratic lawmakers and prison advocacy groups were happy to work with the Trump administration on the legislation  despite early skepticism about Mr  Trump s commitment to the issue  Some of them  like Representative Josh Gottheimer  Democrat of New Jersey  attended the event at the White House on Monday evening  and were even name checked by Mr  Trump  But what has to accompany that  obviously  is ensuring that the bill is implemented   Ms  Harris said  

WASHINGTON   How many ways can you measure the first quarter of the year  For Democratic presidential candidates  it s 300 plus events  26 states and hundreds of voter questions The Iowa caucus is still 10 months away  but the Democratic primary campaign is already an all out sprint   passing eye popping markers for campaign activity and voter engagement  Voters in Florida and Ohio may not see it  but weekends in Iowa  New Hampshire  Nevada and South Carolina   not to mention a handful of select states   are a blitz of candidate rallies and local meet and greets For some candidates the frenetic pace is the message  a way of casting themselves as tireless and willing to take every last question  Elizabeth Warren and Beto O Rourke are trying to make an ambitious schedule and accessibility part of their brands  but Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand have done their parts to keep up with several dozen events each  most in early voting states It s far from clear that the candidate who holds the most events  whether leaping onto tables or addressing big rallies  will emerge as the candidate with the most votes  Still  Democrats watching the display from a distance say the engagement  the activity and the enthusiasm bode well  Broad picture  This is incredibly good for the Democratic Party   said Jim Messina  who managed President Barack Obama s re election campaign The Democrats  contested 2008 primary and the GOP s packed 2016 field showed  that enthusiasm in primaries becomes very important in a general election   Messina said  That s because engaged backers are  more likely to do two things you need them to do  in order to win  he said  donate money and help persuade their social networks to vote For all the recent upheaval in politics  the 2020 campaign so far shows some things haven t changed  Retail campaign stops are still essential to breaking through in early voting states that will play a central role in choosing the nominee  They are  perhaps  even more important in the social media era  One live streamed rally that goes viral on social media can reach more voters than dozens of smaller events Even though no one metric can predict success  a look at the campaigns  tallies of on the ground engagement shows how some of the busiest road warriors are faring at the end of the first quarter Warren and O Rourke are logging mileage in areas their party hasn t always traveled to early on and underscoring their appetite for grassroots interaction  a style Pete Buttigieg is also cultivating  Warren took more than 200 questions from voters and O Rourke answered more than 350  according to their campaigns  first quarter estimates That s a notable feat for O Rourke  who only entered the race last month  The former Texas congressman has logged 55 first quarter events in nine states where he publicly took voter questions  according to his campaign  Gillibrand held 59 public events in eight states since launching an exploratory committee in January  according to the New York senator s campaign  Buttigieg has held 35 events in 11 states since the South Bend  Indiana  mayor started an exploratory committee that same month Minnesota Sen  Amy Klobuchar logged 36 public events in 10 states since forming her campaign in February  according to her campaign s tally California Sen  Kamala Harris has emerged as a top tier contender despite fewer public events than some opponents  clocking in with 26 public first quarter events in eight states since launching her campaign in January  according to an AP estimate  Harris  campaign said Monday night that she took more than 100 voter questions during first quarter events  where total estimated turnout has topped 37 000 Warren  a former law professor whose campaign is keeping detailed statistics  took questions at 48 events in 12 states over all three months  according to the Massachusetts senator s campaign  Her aides measure her commitment to voter engagement partly in selfies   estimating that she s taken more than 12 000 with voters so far  The tally of extra time after events is itself a strategic move  an argument that availability can win the day while other candidates spend time on the high dollar fundraisers she s sworn off Other Democrats are consciously mixing up their number and types of public events  Booker is holding a bigger kickoff of a national tour soon after holding smaller events  The New Jersey senator s campaign estimates that he has held more than 50 public events in seven states since he jumped into the race in February and taken more than 350 voter questions A handful of other candidates have lagged behind in their total number of first quarter events  Former Colorado Gov  John Hickenlooper s campaign has logged 16 events  while Washington Gov  Jay Inslee held 12 events according to an AP tally  Former housing secretary Julian Castro has held more than a dozen of his own over the first quarter All of these candidates tend to fall behind Bernie Sanders in early polling of the Democratic field  Sanders  the runner up in 2016  has held 17 major events in eight states and Washington  D C   since declaring his candidacy in early March Not all of Sanders  events   nor those of other candidates   feature the sort of real time voter questions that are a fixture of Warren s and O Rourke s appearances  But Sanders  crowds illustrate his formidable ability to engage voters on his own terms  The Vermont senator s campaign projects a total turnout of 74 000 people for all of his events so far President Donald Trump famously upended the traditional calculus of campaigning in 2016 by making fewer retail visits as he powered past more than a dozen GOP rivals  Whether anyone in the Democratic field can repeat that model remains to be seen  We want to fall in love like we did with Barack Obama   Messina said of Democratic voters   and to do that  you need to do the retail part of this  Several candidates have made a point of veering off the beaten track  hoping a stop outside the early states will earn them some extra media attention and voter good will O Rourke crossed six states in one week on his post announcement road trip  Warren has made unexpected trips to Puerto Rico and the Deep South  eager to find a way to set herself apart from the pack When the Massachusetts senator touted her  not traditional  choice to visit Alabama during a rally there last month  a voice from the audience chimed in to note that  Obama did it    Associated Press writers Juana Summers in Washington  Will Weissert and Paul Weber in Austin  Texas  Sara Burnett in Chicago  Hunter Woodall in Berlin  New Hampshire  Nicholas Riccardi in Denver  and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this

In the post Watergate era  most Americans have taken for granted that a president would not fire an F B I  director investigating him  or replace an attorney general for insufficient loyalty to the president s personal interests  Dangling a pardon before potential witnesses to influence their testimony  Unheard of Whatever one s feelings about the end of the Mueller investigation  the Barr letter makes one thing clear  The guardrails that were established after Watergate against these types of abuses have been smashed  We still need to see the full Mueller report  but unless corrective steps are taken  Mr  Trump and Mr  Barr will have changed  perhaps profoundly  the shape of presidential power  and in troubling ways It s therefore up to Congress and the 2020 presidential candidates to step in and harden the policies that for 40 years prevented improper political interference in law enforcement They can do this by enacting comprehensive legislation to codify rules and practices that were previously voluntary  Those who subscribe to the Barr memo view of expansive executive power might claim that such legislation would violate the Constitution  On the contrary  such legislation would help enforce it First  Congress should restrict when and how the White House intervenes in law enforcement actions  giving teeth to the norms of the post Watergate era  One model for such legislation is a reform born out of President Richard Nixon s abuse of the I R S  to target enemies  Congress made it unlawful for certain officials  including the president  to  request  directly or indirectly   any I R S  officer or employee to  in effect  weaponize a taxpayer audit  Congress could apply that approach by prohibiting a president from intervening in individual law enforcement proceedings   or at a minimum require notification when a president or members of the White House staff do so  Such a rule would have imposed an additional bar  for example  on the president trying to get the Department of Justice to block the AT T Time Warner merger in retaliation for CNN s coverage  or from trying to investigate or prosecute political opponents Second  Congress should ensure that if the president issues or even dangles pardons in an attempt to block an investigation into his own interests  legislators will receive documents regarding the underlying investigation  once it s concluded   This will both ensure accountability and deter bad faith behavior  Representative Adam Schiff s Pardon Abuse Prevention Act provides a good start  it could be supplemented to apply to so called dangled pardons and to force disclosure of discussions with pardon seekers in investigations implicating the president Third  Congress can make it harder for the government to mislead the public  A little known law called the Information Quality Act creates a requirement that federal agencies ensure the quality  objectivity  utility and integrity of information they provide to the American people  Strengthening the act so that it applies to the president would help expose disinformation and make it more difficult for presidents to take executive actions based on false  determinations  and  findings   Finally  Congress should prohibit the president from using federal law enforcement powers to interfere in an electoral campaign  Procedures designed to check some such activity exist in the United States Attorneys Manual  but that merely compiles prudential guidelines  Congress should harden these rules and expand them to cover other law enforcement agencies  such as the Department of Homeland Security   It could require a Civil Service process to approve sensitive actions around campaign season  An even stronger measure could require early stage confidential judicial approval before a law enforcement action that might impact the outcome of an election could be taken  Such reforms would make it harder for a president to abuse power   such as by timing investigations or announcements to affect a political campaign  using the security clearance process to silence critics  sending immigration authorities to polling places or intervening in Secret Service activities to protect candidates and events Campaign season shouldn t bring government to a halt  and law enforcement shouldn t ignore actual wrongdoing in an electoral context  But given the abuses we ve seen in the past two years and others that might easily take place in the future  we ignore additional protections at our peril Some of these ideas already have bipartisan support  Clear statements by Congress implementing constitutional principles would also provide standards by which courts and the American people could judge the president s conduct The Constitution commands that the president  take care that the laws be faithfully executed   At its core  this commands the president to act in good faith  The founders thought this directive was so important they put it in the Constitution not once but twice  in the  take care  clause and the president s oath As the founders understood  the only reason We the People would delegate sovereignty to elected officials is if we were assured they would exercise that power in the public interest  If our legal system were to approve of the president exercising that power instead to protect his own interests  as the Barr letter does  we may find that our democratic experiment won t extend much longer Ian Bassin   ianbassin  and Justin Florence   justingflorence  are co founders of the

 Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan have looked for judges and justices who could be counted on to oppose the right to abortion  To a startling degree  the fruits of that effort are apparent in the cases now making their way to the Supreme Court   writes Linda Greenhouse in her column  The Flood of Court Cases That Threaten Abortion  Readers shared their perspectives in the comments and Ms  Greenhouse responded to some of them  A selection of those comments and her replies follow  They have been edited for length and clarity    Rachel L  Harris and Lisa Tarchak  senior editorial assistantsWe Had All Better Pay Attention Now  Southwest  Strange how we just take it for granted that our judiciary is partisan  The founding fathers and the Constitution they left for us specifically say that the judiciary is nonpartisan  Yet the Republican Party has been fighting tooth and nail for 40 years to turn our judiciary Republican Linda Greenhouse  In fairness  the Constitution doesn t say the judiciary is nonpartisan and there have been partisan battles over the courts from the very beginning  What we re seeing now  as you suggest  are the fruits of decades of laserlike focus on the courts by one party  and a kind of laissez faire attitude by the other   an asymmetry of intentionality  you might say  that s brought us to where we are today Mor  California  The most outrageous of these abortion laws is the one from Indiana  outlawing abortion of defective fetuses  A fetus  whether defective or not  does not know it exists  Aborting it will prevent untold suffering for the resulting child and its family  So what is the point of this law apart from gratuitous cruelty L G   Laws like this one  giving the state the power to decide whether a woman has the  right  reason for deciding to terminate a pregnancy  not only infantilize women but act to further stigmatize abortion as baby killing and to cover the woman with moral opprobrium  That is their real purpose  It seems to me that if the government of Indiana  so eager to criminalize what it cleverly labels discrimination abortions  was actually willing to help families cope with children who need intensive  lifelong care  it would be possible to imagine having a different conversation  It was the former representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts who famously said that from the point of view of such conservatives   Life begins at conception and ends at birth  John Quinn  Virginia   The real question here is the application of federalism  Some states   New York  California  Massachusetts  Washington  Virginia  Oregon and Colorado   will have laws that allow for unrestricted abortion rights  Other states  like Texas and Louisiana  will restrict or prohibit abortions  This is no different than some states having liquor monopolies  Virginia and Pennsylvania  and some states allowing liquor to be sold by anyone with a license  California and Kentucky   The application of federalism will not end or prohibit abortion  but only allow abortion in states where the practice has significant public support L G   Your comment reflects a misunderstanding of federalism  which does not mean that states are simply free to disregard constitutional rights   Not that the right to buy a beer is in any way equivalent to the right to terminate a pregnancy   but for your information  the 21st Amendment  which repealed Prohibition  explicitly gives the states the right to regulate alcohol sales   Every state has its own constitution  which can protect rights more but not less generously than the federal Constitution does  For instance  the right to same sex marriage was recognized by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts under the Massachusetts Constitution a decade before the Supreme Court issued the Obergefell decision  which interpreted the United States Constitution to do the same thing  States aren t free to declare   but not in our state  RelatedRead the original article  Opinion   Linda GreenhouseThe Flood of Court Cases That Threaten AbortionMarch 28  2019Sam  Virginia  In democratic systems  there are no absolutes  Jurisprudence reflects contemporary politics and culture  To imply otherwise elevates judges and justices  while at the same time denigrating the democratic process L G   You re absolutely right   constitutional values are born outside the courts  and can die there as well  There are several names for this process in the academic literature   constitutional culture  or  in a phrase coined by Prof  Lani Guinier of Harvard Law School   demosprudence   jurisprudence that comes from and speaks to the people  Nothing in my column denies this  To the contrary  I m talking about the actions of judges propelled to the courts through the actions of social movements on our politics  That process continues  It will never stop B  Moschner  San Antonio  Texas will suffer if Roe is found to be unconstitutional  even in increments  There is no way our state will legislate abortion at any stage  However  I suspect that these courts will be strategic and slow at chipping away at these rights  Eventually  red states will no longer have clinics offering abortions  The women with means will be able to travel across state lines to a progressive state for the procedure  but the poor women who cannot care for a third or fourth child will be helpless to do the same L G   Yes  you re right  that is the plan  There are some states now with only one or two abortion providers  and women have to travel hundreds of miles and jump through multiple regulatory hoops to exercise their constitutional right  Under the Texas law that the Supreme Court overturned in its 2016 decision  Whole Woman s Health v  Hellerstedt  there would have been no abortion provider between San Antonio and El Paso  a distance of more than 500 miles  and Texas was O K  with that  Further  it s low income women who get most of the abortions these days  since women with higher incomes are able to avail themselves of reliable  long lasting  and expensive  contraception  Readers interested in facts and figures about abortion should look at the statistical picture from the authoritative Guttmacher Institute Catracho  Maine  A legitimate religious objection to my tax dollars going to fund warfare  bombing of children and other life destroying military activities  putting children in cages after separating them from their parents or denying health care protections to children and others should be given the same weight as an equally legitimate religious objection to abortion or even abortion counseling  The courts should affirm this moral equivalence and as a country we can act accordingly L G   Yes  agreed  And to make your comment more specific to the issue at hand  there are more and more  conscience  based opt outs being created by the federal and state governments  Employers that don t like birth control don t have to include it in the employee health plan  under a newly issued Trump administration regulation that s being challenged in court  and some states allow pharmacists not to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception if they disapprove of the product  But what about those of us whose conscience would require such products and procedures to be available for the good of society  Our voices are not part of this conversation Mark Stave  Baltimore  As a public interest attorney representing abused and neglected children  I have no difficulty in understanding Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati  I have watched as our Maryland circuit court judges trim their rulings to more clearly align themselves with the tendencies of the state s Court of Appeals  When the higher court leaned toward the rights of children to be free of abuse  they ruled that way more often  When they shifted away from children  toward parents  rights to raise children however they saw fit  the judges leaned that way  Judge Sutton sees the way the circuits and the Supreme Court are headed  and he changes accordingly L G   I have enough regard for Judge Sutton to assume that he called this issue the way he saw it   that because doctors have no  right  to provide abortions  they can t be heard to complain when the state tries to force them to give up their ability to provide abortions in order to continue receiving an unrelated benefit  There is some internal logic to this argument but it flies in the face of 40 plus years of common sense precedent that holds that doctors stand in the shoes of their patients  who would not otherwise be able to get into court to assert the rights that they indisputably have  Gerard  Pennsylvania  The real question is whether the government should enforce the consequence of one opinion  There are strong convictions on both sides of this issue  and it is appropriate to debate whether abortion is morally right or wrong  But it goes against the principles of freedom and liberty to enact laws to enforce one view on every individual  We should defend an individual s choice  lest one day our choices on other matters may be reduced by the convictions of others L G   Personal choice  absolutely  The best bumper sticker I ve ever seen read   Opposed to abortion  Don t have one   But if you mean that we should be able to exercise personal choice not to obey laws of general applicability   anti discrimination laws  for example   you lose me there  so I m assuming that s not what you mean Wysiwyg  U S A   Once again  I am reminded of Kamala Harris s question during the hearing on Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court   Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body  Equality and equity in legal decisions are the significant issues here  To allow judges to inject their personal beliefs into making such decisions is contrary to the Constitution s tenets on its face L G   Yes  and it was a great comment by Senator Harris  But I don t actually think that judges  for the most part  believe they are injecting their personal views into their jurisprudence  They believe they are acting as judges  But as Justice Sonia Sotomayor said years ago  in the  wise Latina  speech that she was so unfairly slammed for   we are all the product of our life experiences  The challenge for a judge is to recognize that fact and do the hard work of setting aside the prejudices and preconceptions they bring to the table as people  As an aside  that is not the challenge that faces an opinion columnist  I m always amused by reader comments that accuse me of having an opinion  An opinion column without an opinion is a failure The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our

WASHINGTON   During his presidential campaign  Donald J  Trump often complained about how President Barack Obama drew red lines that he never enforced  and how a diminished America let Russia walk into Syria unchallenged  something he said would not happen if the Russian leader respected the United States president Now  in Venezuela  President Trump is facing his own red line moment   again  with Vladimir V  Putin of Russia For the past week  the Trump administration has  escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country  claiming that Moscow is helping to prop up President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and undermining the hopes of American officials that the Venezuelan military will oust him  The United States has been trying to rally the world behind Juan Guaidó  the opposition leader  as Venezuela s legal interim president On Monday morning  speaking at the Army War College in Carlisle  Pa   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said flatly   Russia s got to leave Venezuela  That followed a statement on Friday by John R  Bolton  Mr  Trump s national security adviser  who said that the arrival of roughly 100 Russian military  advisers  in the country  along with new arms  posed  a direct threat to international peace and security in the region   Mr  Bolton also warned that no country should enter the Western Hemisphere  with the intent of establishing or expanding military operations  Such declarations seem to set up a test  Would Venezuela be the place where Mr  Trump  who has often seemed willing to tolerate Mr  Putin s most audacious provocations  finally draws his own red line  And  if so  does he have a plan to enforce it It is notable that Mr  Bolton  not Mr  Trump himself  made the Friday announcement  with its echoes of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine  the first time the United States issued similar warnings telling foreign powers not to intervene in the Western Hemisphere  In offering the unvarnished declaration on Monday   and while Mr  Trump focuses on the southern border   Mr  Pompeo said he was merely repeating the president s sentiments on Venezuela Yet Mr  Maduro is digging in   despite the economic sanctions against his government and the recognition of Mr  Guaidó as interim president by the United States and more than 50 other nations  And Mr  Putin may well see an opportunity to replay Syria in Venezuela  propping up another leader that many American officials said had to go   Mr  Maduro instead of President Bashar al Assad of Syria  this time   and frustrating Washington s regional goals The administration so far has been quite cautious when it comes to threatening military action in Venezuela  While there have been ritual reminders that  all options are on the table   there is no indication that any military intervention   which has a long and unhappy history in Latin America   is being seriously contemplated Instead  the administration is beginning to talk about an extended battle of attrition  After the Maduro government declared last week that Mr  Guaidó could not hold public office for 15 years  Elliott Abrams  the State Department s special representative for Venezuela and a veteran of many Cold War battles in Latin America  told reporters   I don t imagine that Juan Guaidó is deeply worried because the Maduro regime  while it might be around in 15 days  is not going to be around in 15 years   Why is Russia helping Venezuela  He then talked about tightening sanctions on oil sales  dismissed Russian accusations that the United States was trying to mount a coup against Mr  Maduro and warned that it  would be a mistake for the Russians to think they have a free hand here   they don t   But he carefully avoided explaining why Mr  Putin might feel under constraint ImageA Russian military plane recently arrived in Venezuela  The Trump administration has escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country CreditYuri Cortez Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Putin has plenty of reasons for keeping Mr  Maduro in power  Russia is also focused on recovering billions of dollars in debt that Mr  Maduro owes it  some of which is being paid back in oil  Full repayment may never happen For Mr  Trump  this is the newest iteration of his many Russia problems   and the latest example of his reticence to talk publicly about Moscow s malign influence around the world  His silence is jarring  since Mr  Bolton  Mr  Pompeo and Gen  Joseph F  Dunford Jr   the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  talk about it almost every week They have all embraced the administration s year old national security strategy  which recognizes that a resumption of great power competition  not terrorism  is the primary challenge facing the United States today  Mr  Trump s former aides say  however  that he never read the full national security strategy  and they note that when he does talk about it  he almost never discusses Russia s behavior Perhaps that is a reaction to the enormous  bipartisan criticism he received after his seemingly deferential approach to Mr  Putin in Helsinki  Finland  last summer  when Mr  Trump once again appeared to be convinced by the Russian leader s denials that he had interfered with the 2016 United States presidential election Or perhaps it is rooted  as one of Mr  Trump s aides suggested recently  in a desire not to create the kind of public sound bites that Mr  Obama did   and that he came to regret It was Mr  Obama who declared in August 2011 that  for the sake of the Syrian people  the time has come for President Assad to step aside   And it was Mr  Obama who warned that  the use of chemical weapons is a game changer   then elected  once the chemical weapons were employed  to pull back from military action  Just a year ago  Mr  Trump was still citing that decision  declaring in a tweet that  if President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line in The Sand  the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago  The president is not alone in his critique of how the Obama administration handled Syria  One of the most thoughtful analyses of what went wrong came from William J  Burns  Mr  Obama s deputy secretary of state  in his new book on American diplomacy   The Back Channel   It is rife with warnings that could also apply to Venezuela Mr  Burns agreed with what he called Mr  Obama s  long game  calculus   which included  having the discipline to avoid getting sucked into another military entanglement in the Middle East  which would likely only underscore the limits of our influence in a world of predators for whom Syria s battles were existential  But he admitted that the Obama  short game  was lacking because  we misaligned ends and means  promising too much  on the one hand   declaring  Assad must go  and setting  red lines    and applying tactical tools too grudgingly and incrementally  on the other  Reached in London over the weekend  Mr  Burns praised the Trump administration for avoiding military entanglements that are bound to raise cries of American imperialism  even among Mr  Maduro s greatest opponents  But he said it was at risk of repeating some of the Obama administration s mistakes  The focus on building political and economic pressure is sensible   he said  And he noted that the geographic distance between Russia and Venezuela limited Mr  Putin s ability to affect events   Proximity matters   he said   They don t have a way to project their power in ways they demonstrably did in Syria  As a result  much hinges on Mr  Trump s ability to build a hemispheric coalition  a move that is being undermined  Mr  Burns argued  by the tension with Mexico  especially with Mr  Trump s recent threats to close the border and to end assistance to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras Mr  Maduro  too  may be learning some lessons from Mr  Assad  he said   As long as you control the guys with the guns  even the most unpopular and deeply repressive regimes have the capacity to hang on a lot longer than we might assume   

WASHINGTON   President Trump acknowledged Tuesday that closing the southern border with Mexico could damage the United States economy  but said protecting America s security was more important than trade In remarks from the Oval Office  Mr  Trump reiterated his threat to shut the border if Mexico  America s third largest trading partner  cannot restrict a flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States  But the president s economic team  concerned about the damage from such a move  said it was looking for ways to limit the fallout if Mr  Trump does do so  Sure  it s going to have a negative impact on the economy   Mr  Trump said  adding   but security is most important   Security is more important to me than trade   he said Republican lawmakers  economists and business groups largely disagree with that assessment and warned this week that closing the border could cripple the flow of goods and workers and devastate American automakers and farmers  as well as other industries that depend on Mexico for sales and goods  Closing down the border would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country   Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  said in an interview   I would hope that we would not be doing that sort of thing  Mark Zandi  the chief economist at Moody s Analytics  said that  a full shutdown of the U S  Mexican border of more than several weeks would be the fodder for recessions in both Mexico and the U S  Mr  Trump s economic advisers have briefed him on the potential financial damage from a border shutdown and started looking for ways to mitigate it  including possibly keeping certain trading avenues open Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  said Tuesday in a brief interview that the Trump administration was trying to secure the border without harming the economy  The question is   he said   can we deal with that and not have any economic damage  I think the answer is we can  People are looking at different options  Mr  Kudlow added that the administration was  looking for ways to allow the freight passage   some people call it truck roads   There are ways you can do that  which would ameliorate the breakdown in supply chains   he said But business leaders say there is no way to contain the damage from even a partial shutdown of the 2 000 mile border that the United States shares with Mexico  Nearly  1 7 billion of goods and services flow across the border daily  as well as nearly a half million legal workers  students  shoppers and tourists  the U S  Chamber of Commerce said Monday On Tuesday  officials with the chamber called a partial border shutdown  uncharted territory  and said such a policy would have negative economic consequences  particularly for communities along the border  We don t know whether that is feasible or not   said Neil Bradley  the chamber s executive vice president and chief policy officer Even if it is possible  a partial shutdown would still cause significant disruptions for industries that are highly integrated across the border  including automobiles  machinery and electronic equipment  The North American auto industry will be crippled  in a week  Kristin Dziczek  a vice president for the Center for Automotive Research  an industry research group  said in a tweet Mr  Trump s pledge to close the border comes in response to what officials with the Department of Homeland Security say is an increase in migrant families who are flooding America s immigration system  leading to overflowing detention centers and mass releases of migrants The president told reporters that if Mexico cannot restrict the flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States  and if Congress cannot agree to several immigration restrictions that Mr  Trump has long pushed for   the border is going to be closed  While 76 000 migrants crossed the border in February  that number is nowhere near the migration levels seen in the early 2000s  And a majority of the migrants crossing the border now are Central American families looking for asylum  as opposed to Mexican individuals looking for work  Homeland security officials could quickly deport Mexican individuals seeking employment  but  by law  they cannot swiftly deport Central American families or unaccompanied children Homeland security officials have said they expect the number of crossings to surpass 100 000 this month  And a senior department official said those traveling in and out of ports of entry were already feeling an effect  There was a three hour wait at the port of entry in Brownsville  Tex   according to the official  and there were around 150 trucks backed up and waiting to cross at Otay Mesa  in California On Monday  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said she would divert up to 750 border patrol officials from ports of entry to areas in between the ports to handle large groups of migrants crossing the border  A senior homeland security official also said the administration could start closing traffic lanes at the ports  The crisis at our border is worsening   Ms  Nielsen said   and D H S  will do everything in its power to end it  Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina and one of Mr  Trump s external advisers  has been urging the president to ease off the threat  On Tuesday  Mr  Graham portrayed Mr  Trump s latest broadside as less an eventuality and more a calculated bargaining position  You are taking a bad problem and  by closing the ports of entry  you are creating another problem   he said during an interview   To the extent that he wants to redeploy resources to the points of entry to deal with the ungoverned spaces   that will create economic upheaval  but that will hopefully lead to a solution  Border activity makes up a relatively larger share of Mexico s economy than the United States   meaning Mexico would most likely have more economic damage from a border closing  Mr  Zandi said But that does not mean the United States would be in a winning position  Communities across the country would probably see supply chain disruptions  product shortages  seizures in stock and bond markets and a plunge in already fragile business confidence  Mr  Zandi said  The disruption would be especially sharp in the border states of California  Arizona  New Mexico and Texas  which all have Mexico as their No  1 export market Any closure could have far ranging implications for a wide range of industries   including automotive  electronics and apparel   that source small components and deliver their products on a just in time basis on both sides of the border It could also be devastating for the agriculture industry  Since the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994  American farmers have moved toward specializing in corn  soybeans  chicken  dairy  pork and beef to supply to Mexico  while Mexican farmers have specialized in fresh fruits and vegetables to send to the United States  Any delays in deliveries of these products could lead to near immediate price hikes and empty supermarket shelves  which would hit low income Mexicans and Americans the hardest Christin Fernandez  the vice president for communications at the Retail Industry Leaders Association  said that slowing or halting screenings at major ports near the border would lead to product delays and potentially higher shipping costs  The entire retail ecosystem is sustained on the expectation that America s retailers can provide consumers with the goods they want and need  when they need it  at the best possible prices   Ms  Fernandez said   If our suppliers are feeling the pain  retailers will feel the pain  and  ultimately  it is consumers that will bear the burden  Stock markets do not appear to be pricing in any risk of a border closure  The S P 500 was essentially unchanged on Tuesday  and it remains near a six month high

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has faced its greatest challenge in a generation as officials have struggled to modernize New York City s failing subway  Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo has responded by promising bold solutions to fix the troubled agency and regain the trust of angry riders But here are the changes Mr  Cuomo and state lawmakers unveiled this week as part of the new state budget  A reorganization plan due in June  a  forensic audit  of train cars and signals  a group of outside experts who will review major projects and a  debarment process  that would ban contractors who do not finish projects on time And even though state leaders have vowed more transparency  the authority s new chairman   among the most powerful positions in New York government   was confirmed by the State Senate around 2 a m  on Monday when most New Yorkers were asleep Transit advocates have praised Mr  Cuomo for persuading state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing  which will raise billions of dollars for the subway by establishing tolls to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan  But they were less enthusiastic about his changes at the transit agency  which appear to be more of a bureaucratic reshuffling than a radical transformation Many New Yorkers view the authority  the nation s largest transit agency  which oversees more than 70 000 employees  as inept   if not corrupt  The authority s construction projects are routinely late and over budget   as high as seven times as costly as elsewhere in the world The authority s new chairman  Patrick J  Foye  was approved by the State Senate in the dead of night after hastily called hearings on Sunday  leaving virtually no chance for any significant public input  This is just a wildly bad start at real M T A  reform   said Benjamin Kabak  a transit advocate who runs the Second Ave  Sagas website Mr  Cuomo  a Democrat in his third term  defended the timing  saying that Mr  Foye s appointment was part of the budget deal  which included both congestion pricing and changes at the transportation authority  I said unless we have a management reform plan  I m not going to approve more money   Mr  Cuomo said in a radio interview on Tuesday His budget director  Robert Mujica  said in an interview that new rules would make the authority s board more accountable to the public and the M T A  leadership team understood the urgency of overhauling how it does business  You have a management team now that recognizes what the failures are and recognizes that there has to be a significant cultural change   Mr  Mujica said But Richard Ravitch  a former M T A  chairman credited with turning the subway around in the 1980s when it was plagued by delays and crime  said he was concerned about new rules allowing M T A  board members to serve only while the person who appointed them was in office  The board s members need to be more independent to make tough decisions for the system  he said  instead of acting like political appointees Image I said unless we have a management reform plan  I m not going to approve more money   Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo said in a radio interview on Tuesday CreditPeter Morgan Associated Press This certainly gives the governor more power   Mr  Ravitch said of the reforms John Kaehny  executive director of Reinvent Albany  a watchdog group  said the changes did not address the agency s politicization under Mr  Cuomo  who has been accused of micromanaging the system  Mr  Cuomo has at times prioritized aesthetics  like the appearance of subway stations  over the nuts and bolts of maintenance  The thing at the top of everyone s list is to hire good transit managers and let them do their jobs   Mr  Kaehny said   It may seem obvious  but that s one of the crucial problems  Maria Doulis  a vice president at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission  said the changes did not address the costs of an upcoming union contract for subway workers or improving work rules to reduce costs  The union  Transport Workers Union Local 100  is a close ally of Mr  Cuomo  Increasing the productivity of the work force to be able to perform the work more cost effectively is essential to the success of the M T A    she said   I don t see that part here  The legislation did expand the use of  design build   a construction approach favored by Mr  Cuomo that bundles together the design and construction phases of a project instead of carrying them out separately Mayor Bill de Blasio  a frequent adversary of Mr  Cuomo  said on Monday that he supported the M T A  reforms  even though some say the congestion pricing plan gave away control of city streets to the state  The final plan on the M T A  is one I fully supported   Mr  de Blasio said in a television interview   We got the important changes and reforms we wanted to see in the name of fairness  The authority  which oversees the subway  buses and commuter railroads  had gone nearly five months without a permanent leader  Its previous chairman  Joseph J  Lhota  stepped down in November amid questions over his potential conflicts of interests and outside jobs Mr  Foye is a respected transit executive  though not exactly a revolutionary choice  He had been a top leader at the agency for the last year and a half  He is taking over at a critical time  The subway s leader  Andy Byford  has an ambitious plan to fix the subway by upgrading its signals The agency s bridges and tunnel division will oversee the rollout of the Manhattan toll plan in 2021  making New York the first city in the country to impose congestion pricing Mr  Foye told reporters on Monday that the agency had to do better and  everything is on the table  in terms of reforms  like merging procurement and legal departments at different parts of the agency   The harsh truth is we ve lost credibility with our customers and with our funders both in Albany and City Hall   he said at a news conference to discuss the congestion pricing deal At a hearing called by the Senate on Sunday afternoon that was streamed online  Mr  Foye pledged to serve as the authority s full time chairman and chief executive  without taking on outside jobs  Asked why the system had not improved since he joined the authority  Mr  Foye said the subway was getting better and now he would have full responsibility as chairman  The buck stops at my desk   Mr  Foye said  

CHICAGO   Chicago became the largest American city ever to elect a black woman as its mayor as voters on Tuesday chose Lori Lightfoot  a former prosecutor  to replace Rahm Emanuel  When she takes office in May  Ms  Lightfoot also will be the city s first openly gay mayor Ms  Lightfoot  who has never held elective office  easily won the race  overwhelming a better known  longtime politician and turning her outsider status into an asset in a city with a history of corruption and insider dealings  Ms  Lightfoot  56  beat Toni Preckwinkle  a former alderman who is president of the Cook County Board and who had for years been viewed as a highly formidable candidate for mayor  Here s what you need to know about Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago and the first openly gay mayor for the city  For Chicago  Ms  Lightfoot s win signaled a notable shift in the mood of voters and a rejection of an entrenched political culture that has more often rewarded insiders and dismissed unknowns  For many voters  the notion that someone with no political ties might become mayor of Chicago seemed an eye opening counterpoint to a decades old  often repeated mantra about this city s political order   We don t want nobody nobody sent  As Ms  Lightfoot took the stage in a downtown ballroom on Tuesday night  she acknowledged the unlikeliness of her resounding victory  in which she appeared to win all 50 of Chicago s wards   We were up against powerful interests  a powerful machine and a powerful mayor   she said   Nobody gave us much of a chance  For some of Ms  Lightfoot s supporters  the significance of her victory was monumental  going beyond a single candidate or city   Look  nothing personal  but it s not the good old boys club anymore

leadership   said Stephanie Sandberg  executive director of LPAC  an organization that works to build the political power of L G B T Q  women Ms  Lightfoot s rise was unexpected only weeks ago  when 13 other candidates were vying to run the nation s third largest city  many of them far better known   with decades of experience in Chicago politics and with dynastic names like Daley  Ms  Lightfoot is a lawyer who has served in appointed positions  including as head of the Chicago Police Board and as a leader of a task force that issued a scathing report on relations between the Chicago police and black residents  but she was not widely known around the city until recent months Ms  Lightfoot   Chicago s 56th mayor   arrives at a pivotal moment for a Democratic city that has for the past eight years been led by Mr  Emanuel  who surprised many residents when he chose not to seek re election Chicago  a city of 2 7 million residents  is wrestling with dueling realities  Tech jobs and convention business have poured into its shimmering downtown while public schools have been shuttered on the South and West Sides  and thousands of black residents have moved away  Mr  Emanuel s administration made strides to shore up the city s fiscal woes but residents have complained about mounting taxes and fees  Chicago s new mayor still must come up with an additional  1 billion in the next four years to continue pulling the city out of a pension crisis And the city says its crime problems have been improving over the past two years  recording about half as many murders this year as it did during the same period in 2016  Still  gun and gang violence are pervasive and the city had more than 550 homicides in 2018  more than in the nation s two larger cities  New York and Los Angeles ImageAbraham Lacy and his son Isaac took a selfie with Chicago mayoral candidate Toni Preckwinkle on Tuesday CreditJoshua Lott ReutersRace has often played an outsize role in politics in Chicago  which is essentially evenly split between white  black and Latino residents  On Tuesday  though  the contest between two African American women scrambled the usual political calculus  or what one Chicagoan  Ra Joy  described as its habit of  tribal voting   in which politicians count on support from voters of their own race In February  during the most crowded mayoral primary in city history  Ms  Lightfoot and Ms  Preckwinkle topped a far larger array of candidates of various ethnicities  races and genders  removing all the others from Tuesday s runoff  That left political alignments few Chicagoans had seen before  Ms  Lightfoot pursuing white voters on the city s Northwest and Southwest Sides  both women seeking black voters from a base on the South Side that had leaned toward a different black candidate in February  parts of Chicago s North Side lakefront loaded with signs for Ms  Lightfoot Some residents said the history making nature of the election was energizing while others seemed nonchalant  perhaps partly because Chicago has seen similar milestones  In 1983  the city picked its first black mayor  Harold Washington  in a racially charged election  a term before that  in 1979  the city chose its first female mayor  Jane Byrne  It s not as shocking as it was back then  so that s wonderful progress   Kathy Byrne  the daughter of Jane Byrne  who died in 2014  said of the historic nature of this year s election   Why it s taken so long  I don t know  In many ways  the election transformed into a referendum on Chicago s political culture  known for its miserable ranking on most measures of corruption  its political machine and its habit of keeping family dynasties in power Ms  Lightfoot  who was partner at a prominent law firm  Mayer Brown  portrayed her newcomer status as a sign of strength  pledging to dismantle City Hall s old political ways and to  bring in the light   Still  her claim of being an outsider was questioned by some younger activists in the city  who pointed to her jobs in the Richard M  Daley administration and as a police oversight official during Mr  Emanuel s tenure  not to mention her role as a prosecutor

ReutersMs  Preckwinkle  the longtime Cook County board president  had tried to cast her experience as essential for managing a city the size of Chicago  while simultaneously reminding voters that she had   when she was first elected as an alderman years ago   regularly bucked the political establishment But as the election season played out  impatience over political corruption seemed to intensify among voters  in part because a major corruption scandal was unfolding at City Hall  Federal authorities have accused the City Council s longest serving alderman  Ed Burke  of running an old school shakedown  even as the local news media reported that a second alderman had cooperated with the authorities  secretly recording his conversations at City Hall for months Of the city s 50 aldermen  15 seats were up for runoff elections on Tuesday  Mr  Burke  who has denied any wrongdoing  won re election to another term in February  winning a margin large enough to avoid a runoff Rarely does this city get new  unexpected mayors  So Chicagoans watched with curiosity and uncertainty about what a Lightfoot administration would truly look like  Ms  Lightfoot has portrayed herself as a progressive  who promised to usher in a new era of accountability and transparency at City Hall  At times  she seemed to be running against Chicago politics in the public imagination  A television ad used an image of a smoke filled room and spoke darkly of the  Chicago machine  Ms  Lightfoot has spoken frequently of equity and inclusion  of redistributing city funds to spread the prosperity of downtown and the North Side to neighborhoods that have been neglected  It s unacceptable  the condition of our communities on the South and West Sides   she said during the campaign   The only way we are going to carve a new path for the city  to take us in a direction that our communities don t continue to be resource starved  is to vote for change  ImageMs  Lightfoot greeted residents on the South Side on

staggering bills have not been comprehensive Ms  Lightfoot has said that she will help the city meet its financial commitments by legalizing recreational marijuana and building a casino in Chicago  But she has not explained fully how she would solve the city s imminent pension crisis  Whoever is elected as mayor is going to face a very difficult financial situation   said Laurence Msall  the president of the Civic Federation  a watchdog group For Abraham Lacy  33  a Chicagoan who voted for Ms  Lightfoot s opponent on the South Side on Tuesday  the city s urgent challenges of finances  schools and crime called for someone with deep experience  It s tough to have someone new come in when you have this many things going on   Mr  Lacy said In the end  though  many voters said they were driven more by their perceptions about politics than about policy  Ms  Lightfoot  her supporters said  offered the promise of a new order and a rejection of the politics of a generation ago  It s because of Chicago   Deepti Pareenja  37  said  after casting her ballot on the city s Northwest Side for Ms  Lightfoot   We have a history of corruption with people who ve been ingrained in politics

KIEV  Ukraine   A young television comic and novice candidate trounced Ukraine s political elite in the first round of the presidential election  official results showed Monday   a stinging rebuke by an electorate tired of the lack of change in a country dominated by rich businessmen With the initial vote tally nearly complete  results released by the Central Electoral Committee showed that Volodymyr Zelensky  41  who is famous for playing a schoolteacher accidentally vaulted into the presidency  leading the field with more than 30 percent  He received 5 2 million votes  almost double the number of his nearest competitor  President Petro O  Poroshenko  who had just under 16 percent Yulia V  Tymoshenko  a former prime minister who has run for president twice before  came in third with more than 13 percent  The turnout was more than 63 percent in an electorate of 30 million  the electoral commission said Since no candidate garnered more than 50 percent of the vote  Mr  Zelensky and the apparent second place finisher  Mr  Poroshenko  will face each other in a runoff in three weeks  on April 21 As soon as the polls closed on Sunday and exit polls indicated that there would be a runoff  the two leading candidates began bashing each other Mr  Zelensky presented himself as an insurgent facing a tired old guard that had refused to take him seriously  He walloped a field of 38 other candidates representing different political blocs in Ukraine  most of whom attracted only small fractions of the vote ImageYulia Tymoshenko after a news conference in her election headquarters in Kiev on Monday CreditOleg Petrasyuk EPA  via ShutterstockA Zelensky adviser described the outcome as the culmination of a series of uprisings in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014 that succeeded in overthrowing governments but failed to break the grip of the oligarchs who control economic and political life  as well as the media  This is a struggle so that the political system finally starts working not for its own benefit  but for the benefit of the people   said Dmitri Razumkov  a political consultant for Mr  Zelensky   Despite two revolutions  nothing has changed in our country  Mr  Zelensky has been vague about what he would do as president  and at one point tried to crowdsource his program by suggesting that supporters contribute thoughts via social media  Voters might demand more in the second round There have also been suspicions that he is a front for Ihor V  Kolomoisky  a Ukrainian tycoon who fled to Israel amid a banking scandal  Both men have denied any secret pact Mr  Poroshenko  53  conceded on Sunday night that he had lost the confidence of young voters weary over the slow pace of change and the continuing economic woes  But he said that the time for joking was over and that Ukraine needed a leader who could confront both its socioeconomic problems and  more important  the conflict with Russia The election will help determine the course of the country that has become the European fault line in renewed global tensions between Russia and the West  The war for control of the Donbass  the regions in eastern Ukraine where government forces are fighting Russian backed separatists  has claimed 13 000 lives and displaced millions since 2014 In a sign of the deep rift with Russia  the main rivalry in the presidential race was not  unlike a decade ago  between pro Russian and pro Western factions  The leading ally of Russia this time  Yuriy Boyko  was in fourth place  with over 11 percent of the vote ImagePresident Petro O  Poroshenko came in second in the first round of voting CreditReutersMr  Poroshenko faces an uphill battle in a runoff  political analysts said  not least because he remains one of the wealthiest men in Ukraine  His wealth comes from his chocolate empire  and he did not fulfill a 2014 campaign promise to sell his business  Various businessmen close to him have been caught up in scandals involving corruption The president continued to grow richer as ordinary Ukrainians suffered from low wages and unemployment  noted Volodymr Fesenko  a political analyst The election outcome echoes a global trend of tossing out established political leaders in favor of candidates who promise a complete national overhaul  Mr  Fesenko and other analysts said  The victory of Zelensky is a protest against the old elites and the request for radical political change  a radical update   said Mr  Fesenko  chairman of a think tank called the  Center for Applied Political Studies  It is not so much love for the comedian as  the expectation that he can become a catalyst for change   he said Ukrainians seem less enamored of their leaders all the time  A mere 9 percent voiced confidence in the government  and 91 percent see it as corrupt  according to a Gallup poll conducted in March In Russia  Dmitri S  Peskov  the spokesman for President Vladimir V  Putin  declined to comment on the first round voting results  Russia s main interest is seeing a candidate prevail who will work toward a gradual settlement of the conflict in Donbass  he said Other Russian political leaders and the state run media tried to present the Ukrainian election as a farce and a rebuke to the idea that a political uprising like that in Ukraine in 2014 could force change  Rossiyskaya Gazeta  the government newspaper  said there were signs of  massive violations and falsifications in these elections   the dirtiest and most dishonest in the history of Ukraine  The Russian reports and commentary ignored the widespread perception that the election in Ukraine was democratic  with a real choice and an outcome that was not preordained   unlike elections in Russia  Only minor election law violations have been reported thus far  

WASHINGTON   At the heart of President Trump s negotiations with China is a troubling contradiction  The United States wants to use the trade talks to encourage the country to adopt a more market oriented economy  But a key element of a prospective deal may end up reinforcing the economic power of the Chinese state Negotiators are still working out deal terms  but any agreement seems certain to involve China s promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods  For Mr  Trump  this is an essential element that will help reduce the United States  record trade deficit with China and bolster farmers and other constituencies hurt by his trade war But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state  and most will be carried out by state controlled Chinese businesses  further cementing Beijing s role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese  It seems like those types of really simplistic purchasing commitment type of arrangements would actually reinforce state ownership rather than discourage it   said Rufus Yerxa  the head of the National Foreign Trade Council  which represents the United States  largest exporters After months of talks  the two sides are inching closer to an agreement  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  and Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  discussed the remaining sticking points with their Chinese counterparts on Thursday evening and Friday in Beijing  Mr  Mnuchin wrote on Twitter on Friday that the talks had been  constructive  Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by this week  to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He  the Chinese special envoy charged with negotiating the deal  who will begin meeting with his American counterparts on Wednesday The United States and China had been looking to reach a tentative agreement by the end of Mr  Liu s visit  with a signing ceremony between Mr  Trump and President Xi Jinping of China potentially later this month But the two sides are still wrestling with two major sticking points  how an agreement will be monitored and enforced and how many of Mr  Trump s tariffs come off and when  said Myron Brilliant  executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce Mr  Brilliant said there was no question the United States and China were  in the endgame with regard to a deal   However  he said these factors were  complicating the fact that the agreement is 90 percent done at this point  To pave the way toward an agreement  China made several announcements that could benefit American companies  Last week  Chinese regulators approved JPMorgan Chase s request to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country  a change China had discussed since entering the World Trade Organization two decades ago  Chinese officials have also floated the idea of an expanded trial that would allow foreign cloud computing companies to operate more freely On Sunday evening  China s Finance Ministry issued two statements saying that Beijing would continue to suspend tariffs it imposed last year on American cars and car parts in retaliation for Mr  Trump s tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese imports  Those tariffs  which were suspended while the two sides tried to reach an agreement  were supposed to resume at the end of March  but China said it would extend the suspension indefinitely as a gesture of good will ImageChina imported more than  100 billion worth of American goods last year  including large volumes of soybeans CreditChristopher Smith for The New York TimesThe Finance Ministry said   We hope that the U S  and China will work together to step up consultations and make practical efforts toward the goal of ending trade friction  While the two sides are closer to an agreement than at any point in the past  it remains unclear how successful the Trump administration will be in achieving its key goals  The president s trade war was initiated in large part to try to reorient the Chinese economy and force it to become more open to American companies and investment  Using punishing tariffs as leverage  the Trump administration has pressed China to roll back its heavy hand in the economy  including asking Beijing to curtail subsidies to state owned firms and to end its practice of forcing foreign companies doing business in China to transfer their technology to Chinese competitors China has not readily committed to these goals  in part because such commitments are seen as infringing on China s sovereignty and undercutting the power of the Chinese state  What the Chinese have agreed to most readily is purchasing American goods  especially commodities that can fuel their economy While the final list could be different  the United States and China have discussed the purchase of products including corn  soybeans  sorghum  natural gas  oil  coal  chemicals  semiconductors and airplanes  according to people with knowledge of the talks The Trump administration views these purchases as necessary to bolster the president s support across farming and manufacturing communities hard hit by the trade war and to help narrow the gap between what China sells to the United States and what it buys  The administration has been working on various draft lists of what it wants China to purchase  according to people who have viewed them The final purchasing amount is not yet clear  In December  Mr  Mnuchin said that China had made an offer to buy more than  1 2 trillion in American goods as part of the talks  But economists and China analysts have cautioned that such a large amount could be hard for the United States to produce and export The United States exported just  120 billion of goods to China last year  With the American economy hovering near full employment  it lacks the productive capacity to raise exports by hundreds of billions of dollars in the short term  The United States could redirect some of the goods it sells to other countries to China instead  for instance diverting soybeans headed to Europe to China But a deal that would require China to buy even more from the United States is raising concerns that China could expand its leverage over the United States  If it can be negotiated by government fiat  it can be taken away by government fiat   said Kevin Book  managing director at ClearView Energy Partners  an energy focused research firm The deal could usher in a wave of new American exports if China agrees to open its markets more fully  Removing its requirements that American carmakers and financial services firms team up with a Chinese entity to do business in the country  for instance  could give those firms more ability to sell goods and services to China But in other industries  including agriculture  energy and aviation  purchases associated with a trade deal would be made directly by state controlled entities  And while that would mean greater revenues for American companies  skeptics say it could also increase the leverage that China has over the United States in the future  We are handing them the ability to coerce our companies   said Derek Scissors  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute ImageWhile China would like to buy more tech goods  one of the Trump administration s biggest fears about China is that it is leading a state sponsored effort to unseat the United States as the leading technological power CreditKin Cheung Associated PressSuch a purchasing arrangement could also provoke challenges at the World Trade Organization  which bars its members from granting special advantages or privileges to any one country  as well as directing state enterprises to purchase goods from a specific country China has already demonstrated its ability to influence commodity purchases depending on the tenor of relations  analysts said  Once trade tensions flared  China drove its purchases of American oil to nearly zero last year  Mr  Book said  After a breakthrough in talks this year  China ramped up its purchases of United States soybeans  How easy would it be for the government of China to then turn off that tap when it gets into a dispute with the U S    Mr  Yerxa asked Recent events have also raised a question over some components of the purchasing package under discussion  China had planned to buy Boeing 737 Max series planes  But the crash of a 737 Max in Ethiopia in early March  the second deadly crash of the new plane in less than five months  has thrown those plans into question Last week  China suspended the airworthiness certification for the model entirely  a move Richard Aboulafia  vice president for analysis at the Teal Group  described as  pretty aggressive   I think there s a very good chance that this is less about public safety and more about trade negotiation leverage   Mr  Aboulafia said It s also unclear how many purchases of semiconductors  the advanced components that power circuits in laptops  smartphones and other electronics  will ultimately be in the deal While China would like to buy more of the advanced technology  the Trump administration is concerned about allowing Beijing to gain an upper hand in the next generation of technology  The administration has pushed China to roll back its Made in China 2025 campaign  an industrial plan that pumps state money into building cutting edge industries  like advanced manufacturing and aviation China had proposed last year to purchase  200 billion of American semiconductors  according to people with knowledge of the deal  Beijing wanted to buy the semiconductors straight from fabrication lines at American factories and then do the necessary packaging and testing in China  The United States rejected that idea  The two sides have since discussed a smaller number  but it is not clear now how many semiconductor purchases will ultimately be included in a deal The semiconductor industry has publicly warned that additional purchases could result in the Chinese government s gaining more power to control where Chinese companies buy products  While Chinese companies may buy more American components in the short term  the industry warns that Beijing could ultimately use such a system to redirect purchases to Chinese suppliers instead For now  administration officials are still trying to assure lawmakers that their trade deal will achieve the economic changes the United States wants and will require much more than purchases When pressed by lawmakers in February about whether the deal would require more than just additional sales to China  Mr  Lighthizer told Congress   I do not think it should just be a purchase agreement

ALGIERS  Algeria   Algeria s Constitutional Council formalized President Abdelaziz Bouteflika s departure Wednesday from the office he held for two decades  as rattled international partners watched closely to see what s next for an energy rich country that is a key player in fighting terrorism Bouteflika himself asked the Algerians people for forgiveness the day after he stepped down following weeks of protests and the loss of the army s support  He urged citizens in a farewell letter  to stay united  and never divide yourselves  Bouteflika himself asked for forgiveness from his compatriots after stepping down in the wake of mass protests  and urged them in a farewell letter  to stay united  and never divide yourselves  Algerians faced a new and uncertain era  after the resignation of a man who had ruled Algeria for 20 years and had been a fixture in the Arab world s political landscape for decades A discreet  77 year old Bouteflika ally   the president of the upper house of the Algerian Parliament  Abdelkader Bensalah   is expected to take over as interim leader while Algeria plans elections  But that might further anger the protesters who drove Bouteflika from power  and who want to overhaul a political system seen as secretive  elitist and corrupt  Our session today is related to establishing the vacancy of the post of president of the republic  following the resignation of Mr  Abdelaziz Bouteflika yesterday   said Constitutional Council president Tayeb Belaiz at Wednesday s meeting The 12 member body then formally notified Parliament that Algeria no longer has a president  Both chambers of the national legislature are expected to meet to name the president of the upper house as interim leader for 90 days while elections are organized A much diminished Bouteflika  82  appeared on images shown on national television Tuesday night handing his resignation letter to the Constitutional Council president  Bouteflika  who hasn t spoken publicly to the nation since a 2013 stroke  appeared pale and weak and wore a traditional robe instead of his habitual suits In the public farewell letter released Wednesday by state news agency APS  Bouteflika acknowledged that some of his actions as president were less than successful  writing   I ask your forgiveness for any failing toward you  But he also said   I am leaving the political scene without sadness or fear  for the future of our country   He said he hoped Algeria s new leaders take the nation to  horizons of progress and prosperity  Women and young people  who led the protest movement that pressured him out of office  are  the beating heart of our nation  and deserve special attention  Bouteflika wrote He notably praised those who fought alongside him for Algeria s independence from colonial France and urged Algerians to live up to their example and honor their sacrifices Algerian protesters celebrated his departure with songs and flag waving in the capital Tuesday night New protests are already planned for Friday  after six straight Fridays of massive  peaceful gatherings that surprised the entrenched leadership by their strength and persistence Bensalah  the man expected to serve as interim leader  has led the upper house for most of Bouteflika s four terms  A one time journalist and former ambassador  Bensalah has held senior political positions for the past 25 years but has kept a low profile  rarely giving interviews or appearing at public events He s known as a politician who works behind the scenes to strike compromises and solve problems  and who avoids controversial debates   and is very much part of the political elite Demonstrators worry that those who would play a role in the political transition are too close to the distrusted power structure  including Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui  accused of contributing to fraud in the last presidential election in 2014 and cracking down on past protests However  the protest movement doesn t have a single  unifying alternative to the current political system Another question is what the influential military and Bouteflika s entourage will do next  Military chief

CHICAGO   After Rahm Emanuel announced he would not seek another term as Chicago s mayor  the field of would be replacements seemed to grow by the day  Lori Lightfoot  a former federal prosecutor who had never held elective office  often seemed an afterthought in a mounting list of prominent names   a member of the Daley political dynasty  the head of the county s Democratic Party  a former leader of Chicago s public school system Yet on Tuesday  voters sided with Ms  Lightfoot in overwhelming margins  handing her a resounding victory as she prepares to become the first African American woman and first openly gay person to serve as Chicago s mayor  Ms  Lightfoot s outsider status and her pledge to combat political corruption resonated across the city s traditional dividing lines of race and class  With 97 percent of precincts reporting  she had received 73 percent of the vote and was leading in all 50 City Council wards  Today  you did more than make history   Ms  Lightfoot told a packed ballroom of her supporters that chanted her name on Tuesday night   You created a movement for change   Read how Chicago became the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  and how Chicagoans feel about it  Ms  Lightfoot  a Democrat  used her acceptance speech to underscore the historic nature of her victory  As her wife and daughter stood nearby  Ms  Lightfoot said her win proved that Chicago was  a city where it doesn t matter what color you are  and  where it doesn t matter who you love  just as long as you love with all your heart   She also reiterated her promise to invest in struggling neighborhoods  not just the booming downtown  a hallmark theme of her campaign pitch  We can and will make Chicago a place where your ZIP code doesn t determine your destiny   she said Ms  Lightfoot finished with the most support among 14 candidates in February s first round  nonpartisan election  In Tuesday s runoff  she broadened that appeal and soundly defeated Toni Preckwinkle  a longtime politician who leads the county board and local Democratic Party  The two women will soon have offices in the same building  and have vowed to work together despite a campaign that was often acrimonious In the Logan Square neighborhood on the city s Northwest Side  Deepti Pareenja  37  said she voted for Ms  Lightfoot on Tuesday in part because of the candidate s lack of political experience ImageMs  Lightfoot campaigned with supporters last week  She presented herself on the campaign trail as an antidote to Rahm Emanuel s eight years in office and as an answer to the city s far longer tradition of machine politics CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York Times It s because of Chicago   Ms  Pareenja said   We have a history of corruption with people who ve been ingrained in politics for multiple decades  Ms  Pareenja said she also voted for Ms  Lightfoot in February s first round election  but at the time did not think Ms  Lightfoot had much of a chance of winning  Ms  Pareenja said she was surprised and excited when the runoff field was set The fact Ms  Lightfoot had never served in elective office also helped her earn the vote of Michelle Saulnier  29  a Ph D  student  It s a good thing  especially in Chicago where there s known to be a lot of corruption   Ms  Saulnier said on Tuesday after casting her ballot in the Logan Square neighborhood  where Ms  Lightfoot lives and her campaign signs were all around   I think that s really important to try to break some of these cycles that we re in   Read more about the Chicago election for mayor that resulted in a win for Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to run the city  Don Rose  a political consultant who was a senior adviser to the Lightfoot campaign  said that Ms  Lightfoot benefited from recent corruption scandals that seemed to work against any mayoral candidate who was already part of the Chicago political establishment  It was the perfect situation for some kind of outsider who would capture that mantle and consolidate the reform minded vote   he said   People got fed up  Ms  Lightfoot  56  who held city government jobs under two mayors  presented herself on the campaign trail as an antidote to Mr  Emanuel s eight years in office and as an answer to the city s far longer tradition of machine politics  She criticized Mr  Emanuel s decision to close dozens of schools  mainly in Hispanic and black neighborhoods  and focused especially on promises to overhaul the Chicago Police Department and reduce gun violence  People feel like the violence is out of control and that there s no plan   Ms  Lightfoot said in an interview last year Just a few years ago  Mr  Emanuel turned to Ms  Lightfoot during the biggest crisis of his tenure  A Chicago police officer  Jason Van Dyke  had just been charged with murder in the death of a black teenager  Laquan McDonald  and protesters were calling for Mr  Emanuel s ouster ImageMs  Lightfoot with her daughter Vivian Lightfoot and wife Amy Eshleman before taking the stage to make her victory speech on Tuesday night CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York TimesIn the months that followed  Ms  Lightfoot was chairwoman of a panel that met with residents and produced a scathing report  The document accused the Police Department of systemic racism and found that officers had lost the trust of residents and failed to instill a sense of safety  What we heard from people all across the city is they felt like they didn t even have a claim to the geography in front of their house  on their street  or in their neighborhoods   Ms  Lightfoot said when the report was released in spring 2016 After the report was made public  Ms  Lightfoot drifted away from Mr  Emanuel  eventually resigning her role as president of the Chicago Police Board  which oversees officer discipline  and entering the mayoral race in May At the time  Ms  Lightfoot was one of only a handful of figures willing to run against Mr  Emanuel  who was widely expected to appear on the ballot until announcing in September that he would not  As the field of candidates grew more vast  including the entrance of Ms  Preckwinkle  Ms  Lightfoot forged ahead with her campaign There were reasons for skepticism  Ms  Lightfoot was relatively unknown in the city s political realm  and her ballot petition signatures were briefly challenged last year  But she surged in at least one poll in the final days before the February election  and was endorsed by The Chicago Sun Times  She has the vision  values  qualifications and policies to be an effective leader for the whole city  from the hedge fund managers to the fast food workers   the newspaper s editorial board wrote   She is calm  focused  principled and independent  In the weeks since  as the race took on a venomous tone  Ms  Lightfoot tallied up endorsements across the city  including from several of her former opponents Ms  Lightfoot repeatedly portrayed Ms  Preckwinkle  with whom she agrees on most major policy issues  as a part of the Democratic machine that long dominated Chicago government Ms  Preckwinkle was fond of noting Ms  Lightfoot s work as a  corporate lawyer  and her service in city government under the previous two mayors  And Bridget Gainer  a county commissioner who supported Ms  Preckwinkle  said her candidate s political experience was in fact an asset  We need results  not just rhetoric   Ms  Gainer said in February   Chicago is not a training wheels job   

BALTIMORE   Baltimore already faced daunting challenges  soaring violent crime  a thriving drug economy and poverty so intense that some derelict neighborhoods look like they were hit by a plague  Now  Mayor Catherine Pugh is embroiled in a strange scandal  sucking attention away from those core issues while embarrassing Maryland s biggest city on a national scale The allegations surrounding the first term mayor conjure up a bizarre world where no contract financial deals intersect with children s picture books  of all things  Since 2011  the Democrat has somehow received payments totaling at least  700 000 for tens of thousands of self published 20 page books with titles like  Healthy Holly  Fruits Come in Colors Like the Rainbow  Her main customers for the hard to find paperbacks  a  4 billion medical network  on whose board she served  that paid her personal business half a million dollars for 100 000 copies  and a health care provider that bought  Healthy Holly  books after she became mayor  as that company was seeking a city contract It s Baltimore s latest chapter of murky politics and alleged corruption  of odd bedfellows and weird contradictions  For many locals  it s yet another reminder that their hometown seems doomed to repeat cycles of tawdry mismanagement  reinforcing tales of homegrown sleaze ingrained in pop culture by the gritty TV drama  The Wire   Baltimore s insular politics  with its interlocked civic and political elite  and without clear divides among parties or factions  creates the conditions for scandals like this one   said Daniel Schlozman  a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University For Pugh  an affable  image conscious politician who was once the state Senate majority leader and ran a public relations firm  the stakes could not be higher  Allegations of blatant self dealing have left her increasingly isolated and politically vulnerable  As a growing chorus presses for her resignation  her spokespeople say she s retreated to her home on doctor s orders  taking an  indefinite  leave of absence due to a pneumonia bout Yet at a rambling press conference last week  Pugh painted her  Healthy Holly  initiative as entirely well intentioned  while calling her whopping  500 000 book deal with the University of Maryland Medical System a  regrettable mistake   She held up baby bibs and onesies emblazoned with words like  play  and  crawl  that she said were part of a  Healthy Holly  lifestyle message As public trust appears to erode with each new revelation  many political observers wonder if an indictment will come from an investigation into Pugh s financial dealings as an elected official  On Monday  Maryland Gov  Larry Hogan formally asked for a criminal investigation into Pugh s activities by the State Prosecutor s Office  which investigates public corruption Pugh s lawyer  Steven Silverman  said she looks forward to cooperating with the state prosecutor s investigation and will provide  as much information as possible to put this matter to rest  While the accusations raise clouds over Baltimore s mayor  Pugh hasn t been indicted for anything and it s far from clear how long the criminal investigation will take  Pugh might even try forging ahead  at least through 2020 when her term expires  but many political analysts believe she would never be able to wield power effectively It wasn t supposed to be this way  Pugh came to office contrasting her clean image with her main opponent  ex mayor Sheila Dixon who was forced to depart office in 2010 as part of a plea deal for misappropriating about  500 in gift cards meant for needy families But as Baltimore Sun columnist Dan Rodricks wrote of Pugh in a Tuesday piece  it turns out  the woman who was elected because she did not come with baggage turns out to have had a matching set of luggage you d need five bellhops to carry  Acknowledging that Baltimore faces more tough times due to the latest scandal  Democratic U S  Rep  Elijah Cummings urged people to focus on the many Baltimoreans working hard to transform the city in ways big and small  I want everyone to remain focused on the fact that there are thousands of good people doing important work every single day to make Baltimore a better place to live and work   said Cummings  a native of the city  in a statement touching on Pugh s leave of absence That kind of pep talk is recurrent in Baltimore  a city with a shrinking population and public officials who keep getting into trouble  Just last week  Pugh s onetime police commissioner  Darryl De Sousa  was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison for tax fraud A crowning frustration preoccupies city leaders  Baltimore s latest scandal is unfolding amid the overwhelming  unmet expectations of citizens in large swaths of the startlingly segregated city  There s a failing school system  crumbling infrastructure  and a beleaguered police department under federal oversight Some members of Baltimore s influential legislative delegation in Maryland s capital are now describing Pugh s scandal in almost existential terms  I hope that she s doing some real soul searching   said state Sen  Bill Ferguson  a Baltimore Democrat   This is such a distraction from where we need to be and the issues that we should be focused on to really help rebuild a great American city  so now we ve just got to pull it together and figure out what the future holds  Another city Democrat  Sen  Antonio Hayes  put it more bluntly   It s frustrating as hell

BANGKOK   Thailand s ruling military junta has filed a complaint accusing the leader of a popular new political party of sedition and aiding criminals  a move he described as politically motivated The party  Future Forward  ran a strong third in elections last month that were also contested by a pro military party Future Forward s leader  Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  said he would report to police on Saturday to answer the summons against him  He could face up to nine years in prison The summons did not specify what actions prompted the complaint  It said Thanathorn was accused of sedition for using words or writing  to raise unrest and disaffection amongst the people in a manner likely to cause disturbance in the country  Several criminal complaints and protests to the Election Commission have already been lodged against Thanathorn and his party Speaking to reporters on Wednesday before a tour of a Bangkok neighborhood to thank voters  Thanathorn said the new legal action was expected and  nothing new   We are prepared mentally  There s nothing to worry about   he said   We believe in our innocence  We believe these cases are politically motivated  Thanathorn commented further about the summons on his Facebook page  saying it was clear  that old political games don t end after elections but in turn become even more intense because they are afraid of Future Forward  afraid of our victory that surpassed many people s expectations  He said he would answer the summons to show his innocence and  prove that Thailand s justice system will not submit to becoming a tool for dictators  Preliminary results of the March 24 general election failed to give any single party a majority  making it unclear whether pro  or anti junta parties will hold a majority in the House of Representatives  The Future Forward Party is a junior partner in an anti junta coalition that claims have a majority of seats  but the final official results won t be released until May 9 Between now and then  there could be shifts in party alliances  and there is concern that the state Election Commission  widely regarded as sympathetic to the junta  could disqualify the elected candidates of its opponents The army has several times publicly shown its disdain for Future Forward s policies  The country s influential army chief on Tuesday issued a thinly veiled attack on the party  not mentioning it by name but implying that it has foreign influenced ideas unsuitable for the  Thai style democratic system   which is a constitutional monarchy Gen  Apirat Kongsompong  the ruling junta s secretary general  said the army would do its duty   which is to protect  maintain and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy  Respect for the monarchy is a sensitive and emotional issue in Thailand  and accusations of disrespect are sometimes used by opportunists to smear their political opponents  Thailand has a lese majeste law that makes criticism of the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years  imprisonment per offense Thanathorn has said his party s primary agenda is to stop Thailand s military from intervening in politics  and also suggested its budget be slashed The new party s critics also have tried to tried to sow suspicion that it is allied with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  who was ousted by the military in a 2006 coup and is treated as the arch enemy of Thailand s royalist establishment  The party denies any such ties  and a large part of its appeal appears to be that it supports neither the military nor Thaksin The co founder of Future Forward  law scholar Piyabutr Saengkanokkul  has come under pressure as well  including a summons to be a witness in what appears to be Thanathorn s case Piyabutr has been in hot water with conservative Thais who see him as a threat to the monarchy after social media began circulating a video of a Feb  17  2013  lecture in which he described the role of the monarchy in democratic governments  He responded that the posting was misleading and was not about Thailand s system An obscure conservative organization filed a complaint about him with the Election Commission  and on Wednesday singer and actress Haruthai Muangboonsri formally submitted a legal complaint to police accusing him of being a threat to national security The military has governed Thailand since then army commander Prayuth Chan ocha staged a coup in 2014 against an elected government  Since then  Prayuth has served as junta leader and prime minister  and is the candidate of the pro military Palang Pracharath Party  which according to preliminary results grabbed the biggest share of the popular vote in last month s election According to a new constitution implemented under the junta
