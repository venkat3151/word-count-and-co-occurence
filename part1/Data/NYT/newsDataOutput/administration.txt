Serious train and bus accidents are rare  But when they happen  passengers and their bags have almost none of the protections considered standard on planes and cars The National Transportation Safety Board has long recommended a variety of measures to improve passenger safety  including installing lap shoulder seatbelts  requiring riders to buckle up and improving window safety and overhead baggage restraints  Current safety standards for locomotive cabs and rail passenger cars are inadequate   the N T S B  said in February when it unveiled its  most wanted  list of safety improvements for trains   Protecting passengers and crews from injury requires keeping rail car windows intact and maintaining their structural integrity during an accident  and includes occupant restraint systems  such as seatbelts  to mitigate the severity of passenger injuries  But regulators of Amtrak  Greyhound and a host of national and regional transportation carriers have generally not adopted the recommendations In 2017  44 people died in bus crashes  according to the safety board  The Federal Railroad Administration s office of safety analysis said 21 passengers and employees were killed in Amtrak and commuter train accidents in 2017 and 2018  While the number of bus and rail fatalities is relatively small  thousands of people were injured in accidents in recent years on Amtrak  Long Island Rail Road  New Jersey Transit and other commuter trains  as well as on Greyhound and other interstate bus companies  according to federal regulators  Those 44 people could have been saved   said T  Bella Dinh Zarr  a recently retired member of the safety board who helped lead major bus and train crash investigations   In some cases  just simply wearing their seatbelt would have saved them from being severely injured and then dying from those injuries  or being ejected and killed  or suffering traumatic brain injury  ImageRudolf Wetzel at home in Kirkland  Wash  He was ejected from an Amtrak train that derailed in Washington in 2017 CreditJenny Riffle for The New York TimesThe safety board s call for regulators to evaluate installing seatbelts in rail cars and  securing potential projectiles  resonates in the case of Rudolf Wetzel  He dozed off in his seat on an Amtrak train just outside Tacoma  Wash   as the train made its first run on a new service route south on Dec  18  2017  I woke up when all hell broke loose   he said  The train had derailed on an overpass  sending the locomotive  the power car and two rail cars tumbling onto Interstate 5   I didn t know what was going on   Thrown from his seat and seriously injured  he lay underneath the train  where he could see wheels turning and hear the engine roaring The N T S B  s preliminary investigation determined that excessive speed caused the train to derail as it rounded a curve at 78 miles per hour in a 30 m p h  zone  Three passengers were killed  and 62 passengers  crew members and motorists were injured  Mr  Wetzel  82  was hospitalized for three days with a broken back as well as internal and cognitive injuries On its most wanted list  the N T S B  said  compartmentalization    a design in which closely spaced  well padded and high backed train seats absorb energy during accidents   remains a problem because it  may not protect passengers during derailments and overturns  In a derailment  passengers often collide with one another  In these instances  Ms  Dinh Zarr said  Amtrak s seats don t offer much protection from other passengers or from flying luggage  The overhead baggage racks on most Amtrak trains have only a shallow edge and railing  There are no other restraints or compartments that close with a door and a latch akin to the overhead storage in commercial airplanes  except on Acela Express  according to Amtrak ImageA truck carrying one of the wrecked rail cars from the Amtrak derailment in Washington State  A preliminary investigation found that excessive speed caused the train to derail CreditRuth Fremson The New York TimesJames Vucinovich  a lawyer who is representing Mr  Wetzel and others in lawsuits against Amtrak  said the interior of Amtrak train cabins leaves people vulnerable when accidents occur   You re going to be like a Ping Pong ball inside of a can  In January last year  Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee was among the dozens of Republican lawmakers traveling to a retreat in Virginia on a chartered Amtrak train when it struck a garbage truck  Mr  Roe  a physician  assessed injuries inside and outside the train with a group of other doctors Does he support putting seatbelts on Amtrak   If you wanted to move safety to another level  the answer would be yes   Mr  Roe said He added that he is a mountaineer and not risk averse   But I always harness up  and I m always on the rope   he said   So if I m sitting on an Amtrak and there s a safety belt there  I m going to put it on  If trains have an Achilles  heel  it is their windows  The safety board issued a recommendation 47 years ago about  the problem of ejection of passengers through large side windows   Ms  Dinh Zarr said Amtrak s windows  which are secured by rubber grommets  remain a problem because they can pop out in a crash or derailment  She was on the scene in Philadelphia in May 2015  she said  when eight passengers were killed and 185 were taken to hospitals after a locomotive and seven passenger cars derailed  The N T S B  found that if the passenger car windows had remained intact and secured in the cars  some passengers would not have been ejected and would likely have survived the accident   the board s report on the accident said   Further  the passengers were not protected from serious injuries resulting from being thrown from their seats when the cars overturned  Kimberly Woods  a spokeswoman for Amtrak  said in an email   Amtrak will continue to work with industry experts to explore the enhancement of occupant protection systems on our trains   Amtrak s windows  she said   comply with federal requirements for impact resistance and emergency release  When asked why Amtrak had not installed seatbelts  she said international research on the matter has shown  inconclusive results regarding any improvements to safety  ImageRiding Amtrak s Lake Shore Limited train between New York and Cleveland  The Federal Railroad Administration asserts that seatbelts can bring a higher risk of injury CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York TimesIn a 2017 letter  the Federal Railroad Administration responded to the safety board s seatbelt recommendation   Current research indicates that unlike in the automobile and air transportation modes  adding seatbelts in passenger rail cars is not the most effective way to increase safety  Warren Flatau  a spokesman for the agency  added that the railroad administration s own  extensive research  on the subject  has revealed that the use of seatbelts could actually increase the risk and severity of injuries   He said the agency s focus on  occupant protection and accident survivability  has led to  redesigned tables and seats that contain and cushion passengers   as well as  enhanced emergency egress features  including windows  lighting and  structural crashworthiness  Commercial buses manufactured after 2016 are required to have seatbelts  But after a Greyhound accident in San Jose  Calif   in 2016 in which two passengers were thrown from the bus and killed  State Senator Jerry Hill looked into why everyone on board wasn t wearing a seatbelt  He found that travelers did not have to wear the belts  What s the point of a seatbelt if passengers and drivers aren t required to wear them   he asked  So Mr  Hill introduced legislation  which took effect last summer  making California the first state with a law requiring bus passengers to wear seatbelts in any bus that has them and requiring operators to inform passengers before departure that they must buckle up or face a fine The N T S B  supported California s law  And on its most wanted list  it recommends that every state enact a law that requires all vehicle occupants to use seatbelts and allow law enforcement officers to give tickets to anyone who has not buckled up  The agency said it was concerned about  the limited availability and use of seatbelts in commercial vehicles  including motor coaches  school buses and medium size buses ImageThe National Transportation Safety Board has identified train windows as being particularly problematic

passengers died and 39 were injured in the crash Reid Valentine  a passenger on the bus  said he was not wearing his seatbelt  He said he was thrown into the seat in front of him so hard that it broke   Glass shattered  and I watched the front of the bus just basically crumple all the way up to the front axle  Mr  Valentine said passengers did not receive a safety briefing  so opening emergency windows proved difficult   We were fighting to keep them open so that we could get out of the bus and start getting people out   he recalled  The heavy bus windows don t just pop off  he said   You have to hold them up like on camper awnings  Crystal Booker  a spokeswoman for Greyhound  said in an email   We are constantly reviewing safety features on our buses to look for ways to improve passengers  safety   She added that all buses  undergo thorough inspections  and that  all Greyhound drivers nationwide are trained on safety announcements   including evacuation procedures She said

Greyhound bus killed seven people and injured dozens CreditBrandon N  Sanchez Gallup Independent  via Associated PressWhen asked why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had not issued federal regulations to improve bus emergency exit windows  Kathryn Henry  a spokeswoman  said the agency was still analyzing emergency evacuation research it completed in 2011  to inform possible means of improving the emergency exits  She added   The agency believes that bus window exits must not only enable adequate evacuation in emergencies  but also should not pop out too readily in a crash  Crash survivors  meanwhile  often have to contend with a range of lingering physical and psychological effects  After physical therapy  Mr  Wetzel   who survived being thrown from an Amtrak train   said he was functioning at just 60 percent of his abilities And Mr  Valentine said he avoided all bus travel  I m still at the point where I barely sleep at night   he said   It s something I ve constantly got to think of and it s always on my mind   

The attorney general of the United States has concerns about illegal government spying  At a Senate hearing on Wednesday  William Barr confirmed that he will look into whether the Trump campaign was subject to unlawful surveillance in the run up to the 2016 election  The Justice Department s inspector general  Michael Horowitz  is already investigating the matter  and Mr  Barr says the review is nearly done  But instead of letting his watchdog finish his work  Mr  Barr would rather look into the matter himself   Yes  I think spying did occur   Mr  Barr said early in the hearing  later amending the record to clarify that he was  not saying that improper surveillance occurred   I am saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it  That is all   he added Before day s end  Fox News was amplifying the attorney general s worries  which the president then shared on Twitter Whatever comes of Mr  Barr s review and the conspiracy theories that ensue  he would be wise to reflect on his own history with government surveillance that stretched the limits of the law  Just last month  Mr  Horowitz s office concluded that the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration  failed to conduct a comprehensive legal analysis  when the two agencies undertook a secret surveillance program in the 1990s that swept up records of Americans  phone calls   the kind of bulk collection that the National Security Agency later engaged in after 9 11 The D E A  program dates back to 1992  when Mr  Barr first led the Justice Department under President George H W  Bush  Relying on so called administrative subpoenas  the D E A  would go on fishing expeditions  vacuuming up metadata from billions of phone calls to more than 100 countries  according to a 2015 USA Today investigation The inspector general s office found it  troubling  that the government s collection entailed a  uniquely expansive  reading of the law  under the program  officials would issue subpoenas for records without first determining that they were  relevant or material  to a specific investigation  as the law requires  The inspector general also suggested that the D E A  abused its authority because the records were then shared with other federal agencies that had nothing to do with drug enforcement One thing the inspector general report makes clear  Mr  Barr was in charge as this program came into being and  provided approval  for its deployment without appropriate legal review  In the future  if Mr  Barr wants to move forward with a similar bulk collection program   the Department should conduct a rigorous  objective legal analysis  memorialized in writing  in advance of initiating such a program   the report said Words to ponder as the attorney general  now in his second tour leading the Justice Department  expresses concern over the reach of government surveillance RelatedMore on government surveillanceBarr Asserts Intelligence Agencies Spied on the Trump CampaignApril 10  2019D E A  Secretly Collected Bulk Records of Money Counter PurchasesMarch 30  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

SAN FRANCISCO   In one of the murals  George Washington points westward over the dead body of a Native American  Another depicts Washington s slaves  hunched over  working in the fields of Mount Vernon  These images aren t in a museum exhibition but on the walls of a public high school In this famously left of center city  liberals are battling liberals over these Depression era frescoes that have offended some groups In the debate over the 13 murals that make up  The Life of Washington   at George Washington High School  one side  which includes art historians and school alumni  sees an immersive history lesson  the other  which includes many African Americans and Native Americans  sees a hostile environment Sometime this spring  the school board will make a decision about the future of the massive frescoes that extend from the school s entryway through its lobby  confronting students as they climb the stairs to their classrooms The works were created in the mid 1930s by Victor Arnautoff  a social realist  for the Works Progress Administration  an agency created under Franklin D  Roosevelt s New Deal that provided public works jobs for the unemployed during the Great Depression Arnautoff  who was born in Russia and taught at Stanford  was a Communist who embedded messages critical of the founding father in his murals  He depicted Washington  accurately  at a time when that was rarely acknowledged  as a slave owner and the leader of the nation that annihilated Native Americans  There are no cherry trees ImageA detail from one of the panels  which shows Washington s slaves working in the fields of Mount Vernon CreditJim Wilson The New York TimesBut to Amy Anderson  a member of the Ahkaamaymowin band of Métis who has been a catalyst in the campaign to remove the murals  they represent  American history from the colonizers  perspective  Around the country in recent years  people have been questioning historical representations in public art  Confederate statues and monuments have been dismantled  And in September  San Francisco city workers removed a statue symbolizing the Catholic Church s mission era subjugation of Native Americans  But the Washington High frescoes present a different issue  What they symbolize is open to interpretation  Some see a subversive message about Washington s failings  others see his glorification When the frescoes were painted  critics praised Arnautoff s work  But by the late 1960s  his art aroused anger  The school district responded by adding contemporary murals by the African American artist Dewey Crumpler in 1974  The additional artwork did not satisfy Ms  Anderson and others opposed to the murals Stevon Cook  president of the San Francisco Board of Education  wants the paintings covered or removed   The history we tell is very one sided   he said  An African American  he supports teaching this history in classrooms  but opposes  violent images that are offensive to certain communities   he said ImageOne of the most controversial murals depicts a dead Native American CreditJim Wilson The New York TimesVirginia Marshall  president of the San Francisco Alliance of Black School Educators said Arnautoff s paintings remind her of  my great great grandfather and great great grandmother who were beaten and hung from trees and told they were less than human  Paloma Flores  a member of the Pit River Nation and coordinator of the school s Indian Education Program  said Arnautoff s  intent no longer matters   The murals  glorify the white man s role and dismiss the humanity of other people who are still alive   she said Joely Proudfit  director of the California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center in San Marcos  said it is not worth saving the art if one native student  is triggered by that  Of the 2 004 students at Washington High  most are Asian American  89 are African American and four are Native American  One of them is Ms  Anderson s son  who  she said   keeps his head down when he passes the murals  But scholars see something else in the murals  history  Robert W  Cherny  an emeritus professor of history at San Francisco State University and the author of  Victor Arnautoff and the Politics of Art   points to the artist s critique of Washington   Arnautoff was a major artist  an artist on the left who was being very critical of Washington for owning slaves  and he was critical of the genocide of Native Americans  Gray Brechin  project scholar of the Living New Deal at the University of California  Berkeley  said   It s not a matter of erasing art  it s erasing history itself   He also spoke about the importance of preserving memories of atrocities   The Jews never want what happened to them to be forgotten   he said   That s why they have so many memorials  ImageThe Russian American artist Victor Arnautoff embedded messages critical of the founding father in his murals for the Works Progress Administration CreditJim Wilson The New York TimesWashington High School has one of the largest collections of W P A  art on the West Coast  but it s still a high school  Sharing space with Arnautoff s panels are student drawn signs for  Walk Against Rape  and  2019 ELECTION   which lists requirements including   2 0 GPA   GOOD LUCK  Mikayla  a sophomore who was raising money for student government  said   It s not necessary to hide the truth   She had inadvertently taped her sign reading   2 Spam musubi  over the chest of Arnautoff s dead Native American Matt Haney  a member of the board of supervisors and a former board of education member  said   If you re a Native American student and you walk into the lobby and see your ancestors being murdered in art  that feels dehumanizing   He also has suggested renaming the school in honor of Maya Angelou  who studied there Late last year the school district organized a group called the Reflections and Action Committee to consider options for the artwork Some art historians and Washington High School teachers who spoke to the committee in favor of the frescoes said they felt uncomfortable expressing their views   There was a feeling of animosity in the air   John M  Strain  an English teacher and graduate of Washington High  said  His students  he said   feel bad about offending people but they almost universally don t think the answer is to erase it  Marianne Philipp  the school librarian  also spoke because  she said   It s my job to champion intellectual freedom  It s disturbing to me that this is under discussion  After hearing from both sides  the committee issued a statement that said the artwork  glorifies slavery  genocide  colonization  Manifest Destiny  white supremacy  oppression  etc   and does not represent the San Francisco school s  values of social justice  ImageWhen the frescoes were painted  critics praised Arnautoff s work  By the late 1960s  his art aroused anger CreditJim Wilson The New York TimesIn February  eight committee members voted to recommend that the school district remove Arnautoff s frescoes  two were undecided and one voted to save them  To remove them would be to destroy them because moving them would be too costly  The committee said the frescoes could be archived digitally Lope Yap Jr   vice president of the Washington High School Alumni Association  cast the sole vote to save the frescoes   There are not many people whose politics are left of me   Mr  Yap  a filmmaker  said   If they succeed  this would be book burning in Germany in the 1930s  Mark Berger  a Washington High alumnus and a sound engineer  said digitizing the frescoes  is not an acceptable solution   The thing about murals is that they re out there for anyone to see who walks by  It catches your attention  It may cause you to think about things you wouldn t think about  It s the artist reaching out to you rather than you seeking out the message   he said Barbara A  Brewer  an English teacher at the school  assigned 49 freshmen to write essays about the frescoes  Only four favored removal  One student wrote   The fresco shows us exactly how brutal colonization and genocide really were and are  The fresco is a warning and reminder of the fallibility of our hallowed leaders  The school board will take up the issue in the coming months  If it votes to destroy the murals  Mr  Yap said the alumni association would file a lawsuit to stop it This week  Ms  Anderson recalled a discussion she had had with her son about attending the school with the murals   He told me   Don t worry Mom  that s not going to be up there forever    

Checking your official Social Security statement is important to make sure your future retirement benefits reflect what you ve earned over your working life  Yet a new report suggests that many Americans aren t doing that In recent years  the Social Security Administration has greatly curtailed the number of statements it mails  encouraging workers to check the information online instead But fewer than half the 39 million people registered for electronic  my Social Security  accounts as of Sept  30 had checked their earnings statements in the previous 12 months  according to a recent audit report from the agency s inspector general Linda Sherry  director of national priorities for Consumer Action  an advocacy group  said the findings suggested that the shift to digital statements had left many people without  meaningful access  to their earnings history and that the government was falling short of its obligation under the Social Security Act to keep workers informed That s a problem  she said  because the statements are a crucial retirement planning tool for many Americans  She said she would prefer that the agency gave people the option of receiving paper statements periodically  as it did in the past  rather than force them online The administration s policy on mailing statements has varied over time Two decades ago  most workers 25 or older received a paper statement each year around their birthday  The document provides a summary of annual earnings  It also shows the size of the check to expect each month in retirement  and how the amount may vary depending on what year the recipient decides to stop working Under current policy  adopted in 2017  the administration automatically mails statements only to people over age 60 who aren t yet getting benefits and who haven t set up digital accounts   Paper statements are still available to anyone on request  by submitting a special form  More than 139 000 people got statements that way in the 2018 fiscal year  the report said  The move away from mailing statements has saved the government money  the report noted  Last fiscal year  the agency spent less than  8 million to print and mail statements  down from  65 million eight years earlier The agency mailed just under 15 million statements last fiscal year  which ended on Sept  30  the report said  When that total is combined with the number of people who checked their statements online  it appears that fewer than 35 million people saw their earnings statements Back in the 2010 fiscal year  the agency automatically mailed out 155 million statements  the report noted  That s a huge discrepancy   Ms  Sherry said Asked whether the report raised concerns  a spokesman for the Social Security Administration  Darren Lutz  said in an email that the shift to online statements was rooted in tighter agency budgets  along with an increasing preference by the public for doing business online  Currently  he said  42 million people have  instant  access to statements through their online accounts The agency encourages everyone to create an online account  Mr  Lutz said  and suggests that people review their statements annually to verify that earnings posted are correct  to make sure their benefit estimates are accurate There s also a reason besides retirement planning to review your Social Security statements  to check for signs of identity theft  Doing so is good  identity hygiene   like checking your credit reports  said Charity Lacey  a spokeswoman for the Identity Theft Resource Center If  for instance  your reported earnings are much higher than your own records  it may be a red flag that someone is fraudulently using your Social Security number  said Paul Stephens  director of policy and advocacy with the nonprofit group Privacy Rights Clearinghouse Here are some questions and answers about checking your Social Security statement How do I create a  my Social Security  account You can register on the Social Security Administration website  You ll be asked to enter your Social Security number and birth date  and you ll also be asked a series of questions   similar to those asked when you check your credit report online   to help confirm your identity  Then you ll receive a code by either email or text  which you enter online to complete the process  If  for some reason  you can t set up the account online  you can visit a Social Security office  After you establish an account  you ll get an annual email reminder to log on and review your statement If you have a security freeze on your credit report to help ward off fraud  you must lift it temporarily to set up your online Social Security account  Specifically  you ll need to thaw the freeze at Equifax  the company the administration currently uses to help verify users  identities If I can get paper statements  why should I get an online Social Security account Creating a digital account is a good idea  if only to prevent someone else from fraudulently creating one first and using it to steal benefit payments in the future  said Mike Litt  consumer campaign director with the United States Public Interest Research Groups  Given the number of security breaches in recent years  it s possible someone may be able to illegally obtain your sensitive personal information  like your Social Security number  and use it to set up an account in your name Mr  Litt said it was wise to establish an account and then check it periodically for anything that looked suspicious   You should sign up for your online Social Security account   he said   before fraudsters try to claim it and redirect your benefits to their bank account  Mr  Litt also recommends adding optional extra security  like getting a code sent in a letter via the mail  If you prefer  you can also block all electronic access to your account What if information on my statement seems incorrect Contact the agency at 1 800 772 1213  and have your tax return or W 2 income form handy  

Rite Aid  one of the country s biggest pharmacy chains  will stop selling e cigarettes and vaping products because of concern that they are fueling tobacco use among middle and high school students across the United States Rite Aid said Thursday that it would remove the products from its more than 2 400 stores over the next 90 days  The chain will continue to sell regular tobacco products  a decision that some public health advocates criticized  We re concerned about some of the alarming statistics regarding the use of e cigarettes and vaping products by children and teens   Bryan Everett  the chain s chief operating officer  said on an earnings call  He added that  while many feel these products are beneficial to those of legal age who are trying to quit the use of tobacco   the company had decided to stop selling them because of their growing popularity with young people The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the use of tobacco products  a category that includes e cigarettes and vaping products  jumped 38 percent last year among high school students and 29 percent among middle school students  The surge  driven by the growth of e cigarettes  countered the declining use of such products among young people in previous years  the C D C  found Public health experts warn that while teenage smoking remains at record lows  that could be reversed if vaping and e cigarettes end up leading a new generation to traditional tobacco products Last month  the Food and Drug Administration moved to restrict the sales of flavored e cigarettes  which are particularly attractive to young people  The F D A  has directed retailers to place e cigarette products in areas that are not accessible to people under age 18 The agency identified Walgreens stores this year as a top violator of restrictions against selling tobacco products to minors  The F D A  has sought a meeting with the company s leadership to address the problem Walgreens said in an emailed statement on Friday that it would  welcome the opportunity to meet with the commissioner of food and drugs to discuss all of the steps we are taking regarding this important issue   The chain said it prohibited the sale of tobacco products to minors and immediately fired employees who violated the ban The F D A  also issued letters this month to a dozen retailers  including Walmart and Family Dollar  asking them to submit plans within 30 days that described how they planned to address and mitigate sales of tobacco products to minors  Rite Aid and Walgreens were not sent letters Despite the latest move by Rite Aid  public health advocates were not pleased to hear the chain would continue to sell traditional tobacco products  They said the company should follow the example set by CVS  which stopped selling tobacco altogether in 2014 and subsequently branded itself as a health care giant  CVS was the first major pharmacy chain to stop selling tobacco  which had brought in  2 billion in sales a year  There is a fundamental conflict between their stated mission of improving health and wellness and selling tobacco products  which are the leading cause of preventable death   said Vince Willmore  a spokesman for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids   Pharmacies cannot have it both ways  Other drugstores should follow CVS s lead and end tobacco sales once and for all  Rite Aid said in a statement that many of its customers still wanted to be able to buy traditional tobacco products  but that it had decreased the visibility of those items in its stores in recent years  The company added that it had also expanded its offering of smoking cessation products and trained its pharmacists in a program that can help customers quit smoking  

While designing its newest jet  Boeing decided to make two significant changes to an automated system now suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes of the plane Despite the added risks  the Federal Aviation Administration did not conduct another safety review of the anti stall system  since the changes didn t affect what it considered a critical phase of flight  namely high speed maneuvers The omission involving Boeing s 737 Max exposes a glaring regulatory gap  with the agency s bureaucratic process proving insufficient for the increasing complexity of airplane design  The more we know  the more we realize what we don t know   said John Cox  an aviation safety consultant and a former 737 pilot The F A A  has a reputation as the gold standard in global aviation regulation  with the toughest and most stringent rules for certifying planes  But the March crash in Ethiopia and an earlier one in Indonesia have broadly raised concerns about the agency s ability to push back against the industry or root out flaws In both crashes  the authorities suspect that faulty sensor data triggered the anti stall system  revealing a single point of failure on the plane  Pilots weren t informed about the system until after the Lion Air crash in Indonesia  and even then  Boeing didn t fully explain or understand the risks  The government outsourced much of the certification to Boeing employees  creating a cozy relationship between the company and its regulator After the agency s initial safety review  Boeing decided to quadruple the power of the anti stall system  which could push down the plane s nose  The company also expanded the use of the software  known as MCAS  to activate in more situations Although officials were aware of the changes  none were fully examined by the F A A   according to three people with knowledge of the process The Dangerous Flaws in Boeing s Automated SystemHere s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months A new review would have required F A A  officials to take a closer look at the system s effect on the overall safety of the plane  as well as to consider the potential consequences of a malfunction  Instead  the agency relied on an earlier assessment of the system  which was less powerful and activated in more limited circumstances  Boeing s 737 Max  1960s design  1990s power and paper manuals  While it is unclear which officials were involved in the review of the anti stall system  they followed a set of bureaucratic procedures  rather than taking a proactive approach  The result is that officials didn t fully understand the risks of the more robust anti stall system  which could cause a crash in less than a minute The F A A  defended its certification process  saying it has consistently produced safe aircraft  An F A A  spokesman said agency employees had collectively spent more than 110 000 hours reviewing the Max  including 297 test flights The spokesman said F A A  employees were following agency rules when they didn t review the change   The change to MCAS didn t trigger an additional safety assessment because it did not affect the most critical phase of flight  considered to be higher cruise speeds   an agency spokesman said   At lower speeds  greater control movements are often necessary  Speaking in Dallas on Thursday  Boeing s chief executive  Dennis A  Muilenburg  described MCAS as  one link in a longer chain of events  that contributed to the crashes   We know we can break this chain link   he said   And it s our responsibility to eliminate this risk  A spokesman for Boeing said   The F A A  considered the final configuration and operating parameters of MCAS during Max certification  and concluded that it met all certification and regulatory requirements   737 Max won t fly until the F A A  is satisfied  transportation secretary tells Congress  Some of the details of the evolving design of MCAS were earlier reported by The Seattle Times MCAS was created to help make the 737 Max handle like its predecessors  part of Boeing s strategy to get the plane done more quickly and cheaply Boeing 737 Max  What s Happened After the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air CrashesBoeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months The system was initially designed to engage only in rare circumstances  namely high speed maneuvers  in order to make the plane handle more smoothly and predictably for pilots used to flying older 737s  according to two former Boeing employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the open investigations For those situations  MCAS was limited to moving the stabilizer   the part of the plane that changes the vertical direction of the jet   about 0 6 degrees in about 10 seconds It was around that design stage that the F A A  reviewed the initial MCAS design  The planes hadn t yet gone through their first test flights After the test flights began in early 2016  Boeing pilots found that just before a stall at various speeds  the Max handled less predictably than they wanted  So they suggested using MCAS in those instances  too  according to one former employee with direct knowledge of the conversations But the system needed more power to work in a broader range of situations At higher speeds  flight controls are more sensitive and less movement is needed to steer the plane  Consider the effect of turning a car s steering wheel at 70 miles an hour versus 30 miles an hour To prevent stalls at lower speeds  Boeing engineers decided that MCAS needed to move the stabilizer faster and by a larger amount  So Boeing engineers quadrupled the amount it could move the stabilizer in one cycle  to 2 5 degrees in less than 10 seconds  That s a huge difference   said Dennis Tajer  a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots  union  who has flown 737s for a decade   That s the difference between controlled flight or not  Speed was a defining characteristic for the F A A  The agency s rules require an additional review only if the changes affect how the plane operates in riskier phases of flight  at high speeds and altitudes  Because the changes to the anti stall system affected how it operated at lower speeds and altitudes  F A A  employees didn t need to take a closer look at them VideoBoeing introduced the 737 Max as a reliable fuel  and cost efficient solution to air travel in the 21st century  After two fatal Max crashes  all of the Max aircraft in the world are believed to have been grounded CreditCreditChang W  Lee The New York TimesThe overall system represented a major departure from Boeing s design philosophy  Boeing has traditionally favored giving pilots control over their planes  rather than automated flight systems  In creating MCAS  they violated a longstanding principle at Boeing to always have pilots ultimately in control of the aircraft   said Chesley B  Sullenberger III  the retired pilot who landed a jet in the Hudson River   In mitigating one risk  they created another  greater risk  The missed risks  by the F A A  and Boeing  flowed to other decisions  A deep explanation of the system wasn t included in the plane manual  The F A A  didn t require training on it  Even Boeing test pilots weren t fully briefed on MCAS  Therein lies the issue with the design change  Those pitch rates were never articulated to us   said one test pilot  Matthew Menza Mr  Menza said he looked at documentation he still had and did not see mention of the rate of movement on MCAS   So they certainly didn t mention anything about pitch rates to us   he said   and I certainly would ve loved to have known  The system s increased power was also compounded by its design  The software engaged repeatedly if the sensor suggested it was necessary to avoid a stall  In the Lion Air crash  data showed that the pilots  who weren t aware of MCAS  fought for control of the plane  as it pushed the nose back down each time they pulled it up Few truly understood just how powerful the system would prove  It wasn t fully disclosed until after the Lion Air disaster  killing all 189 people on board  On the Ethiopian Airlines flight  the pilots struggled to regain control after MCAS engaged at least three times Last month  during flight simulations recreating the problems with the Lion Air flight  American pilots were surprised at how strong MCAS was  They essentially had less than 40 seconds to manually override a system malfunction before a crash Updates to the software by Boeing  which will require F A A  approval  will address some of the concerns with the anti stall system  The changes will limit the system to engaging just once in most cases  And they will prevent MCAS from pushing the plane s nose down more than a pilot could counteract by pulling up on the controls Boeing had hoped to deliver the software fix to the F A A  by now  but it was delayed by several weeks  As a result  the grounding of the jet is expected to drag on  Southwest Airlines has changed its schedule through early August and American Airlines cancellations stretch into June  

WASHINGTON   The United States will not clear Boeing 737 Max jets for flight again until federal officials are satisfied that Boeing has fixed its flawed flight control system  Transportation Secretary Elaine L  Chao said in testimony on Wednesday Ms  Chao  appearing before House subcommittee hearings concerning her department s budget  offered no timeline for the plane to return to service after the Federal Aviation Administration s decision to ground the jets on March 13 But she said Boeing appeared close to completing a software upgrade on a crucial sensor believed to have played a role in the crashes of two Max jets  An Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa on March 10  killing 157  and a Lion Air 737 Max crashed last October  killing all 189 people on board  The F A A  will not approve Boeing s proposed changes until the F A A  is satisfied it is safe   said Ms  Chao  who has come under fire for her department s actions after the Lion Air disaster Ms  Chao  reading from prepared answers at times  defended the F A A  s decision not to follow the lead of 40 other countries by immediately grounding the fleet  despite the possibility that the Ethiopia crash might have resulted from a flaw in a plane whose basic design dates to the 1960s The F A A   which Ms  Chao oversees  waited three days to ground the fleet and was one of the last major regulators worldwide to do so  She flew back to Washington from a festival in Texas on March 12 on a 737 Max  in what seemed to be an endorsement of the plane s safety  Less than a day later the F A A  uncovered evidence that suggested the planes were not fit to fly  The F A A  saw no basis upon which to ground these planes   she said   It is a very technical organization  It is very data driven  They saw no data until the morning of Wednesday the 13th  It was at that time  she added  that F A A  investigators discovered  new information on the first three minutes of the Ethiopian  flight that revealed  parallel conditions  involving the two accidents But in an interview after the hearing  Ms  Chao made it clear that the decision to ground the jets was the F A A  s   not her own   and said that she had no legal say  then or now  in deciding when the planes fly F A A  officials  are very careful about jumping to conclusions  having gone through other tragedies   she said   They are very careful about rushing to action  Ms  Chao s critics have argued that she could have exerted greater pressure on F A A  officials and avoided the appearance that she was endorsing the aircraft s airworthiness When asked  after the hearing  about her 737 flight from Texas  Mr  Chao said   I flew down on the 737 and I flew back on the 737  Those are the flights that were chosen  so I went on it  I didn t really have any concern about the safety  but that is irrelevant now  At the hearing  Representative David Price  Democrat of North Carolina and the chairman of the House Appropriations transportation subcommittee  asked a pointed question   Were there any lessons learned   He added   Should or could the F A A  have taken a different approach  Mr  Price also pressed Ms  Chao on whether the review process for new aircraft designs gives Boeing and other manufacturers too much latitude in overseeing their own designs and upgrades  a process critics have likened to self certification Ms  Chao said she did not yet  have answers  but said she had taken two steps   prompting an inquiry into the crashes by the department s inspector general and convening a special panel to look into the issue  We always need to improve   she said  

Leigh syndrome is a terrible disease  In the worst cases  it emerges shortly after birth and claims one major organ after another  Movement becomes difficult  and then impossible  A tracheotomy and feeding tube are often necessary by toddlerhood  and as the disease progresses  lungs frequently have to be suctioned manually  Most children with the condition die by the age of 5 or 6 Leigh syndrome is one of hundreds of so called mitochondrial diseases  which are caused by defects in the specialized cellular compartments   called mitochondria   that produce 90 percent of the body s energy  These disorders are rare  about 1 000 to 4 000 babies in the United States are born with one every year  But they are devastating  They can result in grave impairment of nearly any bodily system  They are largely untreatable  uniformly incurable and very difficult to screen for Some might also be preventable  Scientists have devised a procedure called mitochondrial replacement therapy  M R T   that involves transplanting the nucleus of an affected egg   mitochondrial diseases are passed down from the mother s side   into an unaffected one whose nucleus has been removed   The procedure is sometimes called  three parent I V F     in vitro fertilization   because mitochondria contain a minuscule amount of DNA  any resulting embryo would have mitochondrial DNA from the donor egg and nuclear DNA from each of its parents  After decades of careful study in petri dishes  flies  rodents and primates  M R T  is finally being tested in human clinical trials by doctors in Britain   Officials there have yet to confirm any births   In the United States  however  the procedure is effectively illegal  In 2015  members of Congress quietly attached a two sentence rider to an enormous appropriations bill  prohibiting the clinical use of any technology that would produce a genetically modified baby  Just two months later  a report from the National Academies of Science  Engineering and Medicine concluded that human trials of M R T  would be ethically permissible as long as several key safeguards were in place On Wednesday  the Petrie Flom Center at Harvard Law School will host a round table discussion  during which the scientists  ethicists and families at the center of this issue will make the first significant attempt to reconcile the federal ban with the federally commissioned report The participants will have much to discuss  For starters  proponents of M R T  have long held that the procedure should be exempted from the current prohibition  in part because it does not involve altering any genetic code  Defective mitochondria are swapped out for healthy ones  but mitochondrial DNA governs only a handful of basic cellular functions  It is separate from nuclear DNA  which helps determine individual traits like physical appearance  intelligence and personality  That means M R T  cannot be used to produce the genetically enhanced  designer babies  that so many people are concerned about  That s not to say that the procedure is risk free  There s no way to know how safe or effective M R T  is until doctors test it in humans  Clinical trials and the American regulatory apparatus were designed for exactly this purpose  to minimize risk without forgoing medical progress  But opponents of mitochondrial replacement therapy say that in this case  to proceed with such trials would be to subject future humans to an experiment that they are powerless to oppose   What will making babies be like in the future  Huge pools of health data may allow you to pick many of your child s genetic traits  Is that a good thing  Though that s true  the same might be said of any birth  whether it s assisted by technology or not  New life is always a risky proposition in which the life itself has no say  And parents have always tried to tip the odds toward success with deliberate actions   from prenatal nutrition to choice of school district   that can echo down through generations Some members of Congress have indicated that the 2015 clinical ban could be lifted   or amended to exclude M R T    once such ethical questions are resolved  But they ve already reauthorized it three times without any further public discussion They might look to their British counterparts for a template on moving forward  Before officials in the United Kingdom approved mitochondrial replacement therapy  they held multiple parliamentary debates on the issue  They also hosted public workshops and conducted in person interviews and surveys that thousands of citizens participated in  When it became clear that there was broad support for moving forward  the British government established protocols for licensing clinics that wanted to try the procedure  and for monitoring the health of any resulting children There s no telling how things will play out in the United States  When the Food and Drug Administration held a forum on M R T  in 2014  the agency received hundreds of letters opposing the idea  but a good portion of those letters were form emails  and many of them indicated a poor understanding of mitochondrial DNA and of the replacement therapies in question  Surveys have consistently shown that most Americans support the use of technology that modifies the human genome  as long as it s to eliminate diseases The coming round table offers a good start to a long overdue public dialogue  The group s conclusions about if  when and how to proceed with human trials of M R T  are not foregone  But one hopes that as they talk  the nation s leaders will listen Related More on mitochondrial replacement therapyGenetically Modified People Are Walking Among UsDec  1  2018Birth of Baby With Three Parents  DNA Marks Success for Banned

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved an osteoporosis drug that represents the first new treatment approach in nearly two decades   a strategy based on a rare gene mutation in people with bones so dense that they never break About 10 million people in the United States have osteoporosis  Worldwide  about 200 million people have brittle bones  one in three women  and one in five men  will suffer a fracture because of osteoporosis  often of the hip or spine  For many  the break leads to a downward spiral of disability  Standard treatments  drugs called bisphosphonates  stop the loss of bone but do not build it  The alternatives  parathyroid hormone and a derivative  build bone but also break it down  limiting the therapeutic effect  The new drug  romosozumab  brand name Evenity   developed by Amgen in collaboration with the Belgian drug company UCB  restores bone without breaking it down  according to the findings of two large clinical trials   Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  It was approved only for postmenopausal women with a high risk of fracture  and will carry a warning on its label that it may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke  the F D A  said   This is an extraordinarily important drug   said Dr  Richard Bockman  chief of the endocrine service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York   It s a true bone building drug that takes advantage of the underlying biology of bone   In large clinical trials  patients taking the drug saw increases in bone density in their spines on the order of 15 percent   a huge figure  similar to the amount of bone made in early adolescence  said Dr  Clifford J  Rosen  an osteoporosis expert at Maine Medical Center Research Institute and member of an F D A  panel that evaluated the data  Merely a 6 percent increase in bone density can translate into a doubling of bone strength  Dr  Bockman said  In the trials  patients taking the drugs saw a reduction in breaks  both in the spine and  clinical  fractures   broken bones that a patient notices  rather than  say  a collapsed vertebra discovered only in X rays In one study  spinal fractures occurred in 127 of 2 046 patients taking the new drug  compared with 243 of 2 047 taking alendronate  an older drug   It s a tremendous advance   said Dr  Dolores Shoback  a professor of medicine and an osteoporosis expert at the University of California  San Francisco But there also was a small  unexpected increase in heart attacks  strokes and sudden deaths in that study   50 of 2 040 patients  or 2 5 percent  taking Evenity  compared with 38 of 2 014  or 1 9 percent  taking alendronate  The effect was seen in one of the two large clinical trials  but not the other  The F D A  said it was requiring the boxed warning on the drug s label saying the drug should not be used by people who had a heart attack or stroke in the past year  Doctors should also consider whether to prescribe the drug to patients at high risk for heart attacks and strokes  Patients who have a heart attack or stroke while taking Evenity should stop taking the drug Side effects can include joint pain and headaches and irritation at the injection site The agency is requiring the company to conduct a post marketing study of cardiovascular risks  It is hard to know what to make of the possible risk  said Dr  Bart Clarke  a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic and president of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research   Maybe there is something unique about those patients   he said Amgen would not disclose the price at the time of approval  saying it would be disclosed next week  Evenity will be given as a monthly injection  Parathyroid hormone is given as a daily injection  while the drugs in the other major treatment class  the bisphosphonates  are taken as pills The new drug has a striking back story In 1964  researchers began studying an unusual group of Afrikaner patients in South Africa  They were tall and heavy  but not fat  Instead  their bones were large and dense  Their bones grew so profusely that their heads became distorted  Their jaws were large  and an overgrowth of bone in their skulls impinged upon nerves  often causing deafness or facial palsy  Many had terrible headaches  In some  the index and middle fingers fused together  In 2001  scientists reported that all these effects resulted from a single gene mutation  The finding led researchers to understand how the body controls the building of bone  Bones are in a state of constant flux  built up and broken down by the body  In osteoporosis  the balance is disrupted   more bone is broken down than is made  Bone cells make a protein called sclerostin that halts the production of bone and increases its breakdown  The gene mutation in the Afrikaner patients stops the production of sclerostin  so their bodies keep building bone without brakes  Scientists reasoned that if they could mimic the mutation by blocking sclerostin with an antibody  people with osteoporosis should build more bone  Once bone density increased  patients could stop taking the sclerostin blocking drug and switch to an older drug to maintain the new bone  Animal studies were successful  as were clinical trials  culminating in two large studies involving more than 10 000 postmenopausal women  In one trial  Evenity was compared to a placebo  in the other  it was compared to a bisphosphonate  In both studies  women taking Evenity ended up with more bone and fewer fractures In January  Evenity was reviewed by an advisory committee to the F D A   which voted 18 to 1 for approval   but called for Amgen to do more research to understand the possible cardiovascular side effects  There is a tremendous need for this medication  and there is an amazing amount of morbidity and mortality with this disease   said Dr  Frederick G  Kushner  a cardiologist at the Heart Clinic of Louisiana and a panel member  who voted to approve the drug The next step  Dr  Bockman said  is for companies to develop pills to block sclerostin so patients do not have to have monthly injections It may not be easy to convince patients to take the new drug  Experts anticipate that it will be offered to patients at highest risk  those who have had a serious fracture  or who have taken bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone  and did not respond or experienced serious side effects All too often  however  high risk patients are afraid to take drugs to prevent fractures  They remember stories of the rare patients who took bisphosphonates and had an unusual fractures or deterioration of the bones in their jaws  They don t remember the good   that fractures are being prevented   Dr  Shoback said   They remember some pivotal terrible thing that someone told them   Dr  Bockman has seen these patients  too  but hopes they can be convinced at least to try Evenity  This is a very important  great new drug   he said   And it is something we really need   

Boeing dismissed concerns about a powerful new anti stall system on the 737 Max for months  insisting that pilots could deal with any problems by following a checklist of emergency procedures Now  the preliminary findings from the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 have cast doubt on whether those instructions were sufficient  adding to the scrutiny over Boeing s and federal regulators  response to two deadly crashes involving the same jet model The findings  released Thursday in Ethiopia  suggest that the pilots on the Ethiopian Airlines flight initially followed the prescribed procedures after the anti stall system malfunctioned  They shut off the electricity that allows the automated software to push the plane s nose down and took manual control of the jet  They then tried to right the plane  with the captain telling his co pilot three times to  pull up  But they could not regain control  About four minutes after the system initially activated  the plane hit the ground at colossal speed  killing all 157 people on board  The captain was not able to recover the aircraft with the procedures he was trained on and told by Boeing   said Dennis Tajer  a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots union and a 737 pilot  who read the report The findings laid out a timeline of the March 10 flight based on analysis from 18 Ethiopian and international investigators and information from the jet s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder  While the findings are not yet final  the initial evidence has raised new concerns about whether Boeing and federal regulators provided sufficient guidance for pilots  The report and other evidence suggest that Boeing s procedures may not have worked well when a plane was flying at a high speed The pilots had a short window to react before going into an irrecoverable nose dive  Tests of the 737 Max have shown that once faulty data triggered the system  pilots had little time to save the aircraft  The system  according to the investigators  findings  appears to have forced the nose of the plane down several times in less than three minutes A Faulty SensorMoments after takeoff  one of two crucial sensors that measure the plane s angle of attack diverged wildly  eventually triggering an automated system that pushed down the nose of the plane        g ethiopia aoa box  g artboard     margin 0 auto

underestimated the power of the new software  known as the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system  or MCAS  It was too aggressive   he said   They left the pilot with no ability to gain control of the aircraft if it went to the full limit  The preliminary findings add to Boeing s woes  which have mounted after the Ethiopian Airlines disaster and the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max less than five months earlier in Indonesia  The company said this week that it needed more time to finish a software update and training  which will be necessary before the planes can fly again Lawmakers and regulators are scrutinizing Boeing and the process for certifying the 737 Max  The families of passengers and crew killed in the two crashes have hired lawyers to pursue claims against Boeing

said Chesley B  Sullenberger III  the aviation expert and retired pilot who landed a jet in the Hudson River   This never should have happened  Dennis A  Muilenburg  Boeing s chief executive  acknowledged the role of the software in the accident   As pilots have told us  erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment   he said in a statement on Thursday   It s our responsibility to eliminate this risk  We own it  and we know how to do it  The Federal Aviation Administration said   We continue to work toward a full understanding of all aspects of this accident  As we learn more about the accident and findings become available  we will take appropriate action  Boeing 737 Max  What s Happened After the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air CrashesBoeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months VideoDennis A  Muilenburg  Boeing s chief executive  said on Thursday that Boeing s software did play a role in the crashes of both Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 CreditCreditBen Stansall Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesAt a news conference on Thursday  Dagmawit Moges  Ethiopia s minister of transportation  said the flight crew had  performed all the procedures  repeatedly  provided by the manufacturer  but were not able to control the aircraft  The report  which could change in the coming months when it s completed  doesn t rule out the potential for pilot error in the Ethiopian crash  And some pilots in the United States raised doubts about whether the problems on board had been properly handled  They did not follow the Boeing procedures   said Hart Langer  a former Pan Am pilot and United Airlines executive  If the pilots had used the electric controls to pull the nose up more  he said  they would have been able to recover the plane  Had they done that  it would have cut out the MCAS input   he said  Here s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes  and what Boeing has been doing since  When Boeing outlined the emergency process in November after the Lion Air disaster  many pilots were confident that the new instructions were enough to avoid a crash  However  pilots didn t test the updated procedures in flight simulators  because few airlines had them for the 737 Max The problems with the Ethiopian Airlines flight started almost immediately after takeoff  according to the report  amplifying the pressure for pilots to act  About two minutes after takeoff  a safety system warned   Don t sink   multiple times A sensor that measures the angle at which the plane is flying began producing erroneous readings  suggesting that the plane was about to stall  There are two so called angle of attack sensors on the plane  and the one on the left began giving readings nearly 60 degrees different from the one on the right  The faulty data activated the software that automatically pushed down the nose of the plane The Dangerous Flaws in Boeing s Automated SystemHere s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months Once the system kicked in  the report said  the pilots appear to have followed the steps in the checklist that Boeing issued after the crash of Lion Air Flight 302 in October  First  they used electrical switches on their control wheels to bring the nose back up About five seconds later  the anti stall software activated again  pushing the plane toward the ground  according to the report  The pilots again used the switches to pull up the plane  And then  as prescribed by the emergency checklist  they disabled the electrical system that powered the software that pushed the plane down That move forced the crew to manually control the stabilizers  which help right the plane  by turning a wheel next to their seats that helps manually pull the plane s nose up  Soon after that  the first officer said the manual method was  not working   the report detailed The plane s speed appears to have complicated pilot s efforts to regain control  At high speeds  the force on the plane may make it nearly impossible for pilots to turn the wheel that controls the tail There is no indication that the Ethiopian pilots tried to slow the jet down  according to data from the flight recorder  What needs to be understood and explained is why the airspeed basically increased throughout the flight and the throttles did not move   said Jon Weaks  the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association When the manual process didn t work for the Ethiopian Airlines pilots  they appear to have turned back on the electricity to the flight control system in a last ditch effort at recovery  But the software activated one last time  sending the plane into a deadly nose dive  

Mother s little helpers  Wine o clock  Sleeping pills  Parents have long relied on a variety of chemicals to help them get through the day  But modern day expectations   along with the pressures of balancing work and home   are breeding guilt and anxiety  leading some moms and dads to look for new ways to relax without the woolly headed side effects of alcohol or medication  Enter cannabidiol  or CBD  a chemical found in hemp and marijuana  Although the science is far from conclusive  it has been marketed as a cure all for problems as varied as anxiety  chronic pain  inflammation and sleep disturbances  But unlike THC  another chemical found in cannabis  it doesn t make users high and  according to the World Health Organization  it does not appear to be addictive   It definitely helps when your kid punches you in the face   said Fritz Hubig  45  a real estate broker in Washington  D C   and the father of a 2 year old   If I did not embrace meditation and CBD  I m not sure where I d be  About nine months ago  Mr  Hubig started experimenting with CBD oil at the encouragement of his brother  who has been in the cannabis industry for more than two decades  After a month or so  Mr  Hubig figured out which dosage felt right  and now estimates that his stress level has been reduced by at least half  Being high strung and nervous and then having a kid  it s like   holy smokes   said Mr  Hubig  who works up to 80 hours a week   I was just so worried about everything   Enjoying this article  Sign up for the NYT Parenting newsletter here to get real stories like this  evidence based guidance and more in your inbox every Wednesday  CBD use is growing among all adults in the United States  not just parents  The Brightfield Group  a cannabis market research firm  says CBD sales are expected to reach  22 billion by 2022  But is it safe to use  So far  the Food and Drug Administration has approved only one drug containing CBD  Epidiolex  which is used to reduce seizures associated with two rare forms of epilepsy  The agency recently announced that it is holding a public hearing at the end of May to gather information about the safety  manufacturing  product quality and marketing of cannabis or cannabis derived compounds  including CBD The chemical is making headlines in part because of a new law  The 2018 farm bill legalized the production of hemp  which it defined as cannabis containing less than 0 3 percent THC  a move that is expected to help CBD vendors  But the F D A  said on its website that it does not permit CBD to be sold as dietary supplements or in food that crosses state lines  and has sent warning letters to several companies marketing products containing CBD Despite the need for more scientific information about CBD and its long term effects on the body  CBD products are everywhere  including coffee  cocktails and ice cream  It also appears in oils  salves  powder  bath bombs  gummies   even sexual lubricants   It s important for people to know that there s been no research at all on the CBD products that are sold online or in stores   said Dr  Esther Blessing  an assistant professor of psychiatry at N Y U  Langone Health who has been studying CBD for about five years   There s no safety net here  While some companies selling CBD products perform third party lab testing and tout rigorous protocols to ensure purity  there isn t central regulatory oversight to ensure high standards  which means there s plenty of snake oil  A 2017 study analyzing 84 CBD products from 31 different companies found that the amount of CBD on the label was often inaccurate  Perhaps most concerning  THC was detected in 18 of the 84 samples  Some of the products had levels of THC roughly equivalent to  a few deep puffs  on a joint  according to Dr  Brian F  Thomas  one of the authors of the study and a senior research scientist at RTI International  a nonprofit research institute But the inadequate oversight of these products hasn t stopped people from buying them  In fact  some users swear by their CBD products  and say it has become a balm for the pressures of parenting  Jen Bernstein  38  the mother of a 3 year old  uses CBD to help her sleep and decompress  I m less likely to scream and freak out that there s  you know  hot pink Play Doh smushed into the carpet   she said   It kind of washes away the day s stress  So instead of having a glass of wine  at the end of the day Ms  Bernstein prefers to eat CBD gummies   Eating a gummy it s just kind of like  you know what  She s 3  I don t have to take it personally that she s not eating my food  She s just picky right now   she said of her daughter  adding   I don t have to sweat the small stuff  Last year Ms  Bernstein co founded Women s Cannabis Club in New York City  which holds events for women interested in cannabis  art  culture and science  A recent workshop  headlined by a urologist  explored how CBD can enhance one s sex life  So far the club has more than 500 followers on Instagram and an active membership of about 50 women  many of them mothers  Ms  Bernstein said  She and her co founders are planning to create a similar club in Boston this year  Ellie Zitsman  the mother of a 3 year old  joined the New York club last year  She takes CBD oil a few times a week to help her sleep better  and as an antidote to  having to be on all the time as a parent    I have a pretty high stress job   said Ms  Zitsman  33  who is the head of research and development at Van Leeuwen Ice Cream in Brooklyn   a company that debuted a CBD ice cream flavor before New York City cracked down on CBD edibles   I have a hard time with my mind kind of settling at the end of the day  Families in the United States face anxiety provoking challenges  especially when juggling home life and work  researchers say  There is no federally mandated paid parental leave  no universal child care  no universal health care   the list goes on  That makes parenting hard in  a new  novel and increasingly frightening way   said Caitlyn Collins  an assistant professor of sociology at Washington University in St  Louis and author of the book  Making Motherhood Work  How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving   Exhaustion  chronic stress  little exercise and free time   these have public health consequences   Parents today also tend to spend more time working  said Dr  Elizabeth M  Fitelson  a perinatal psychiatrist and director of the Women s Program at the Columbia University Medical Center s department of psychiatry In addition  she said  it can sometimes seem as though  there are a million and one ways to do parenting wrong and there are plenty of people willing to tell you so  Over the last year  she added  some of her patients have asked about CBD oil and its effectiveness for anxiety or insomnia   If someone tells me they re using it and it s helpful for them and it doesn t appear to be causing side effects  I m not judgmental about it   she said   But because we just don t know enough about it  it certainly wouldn t be anything I would recommend   Tara Lynn Bailey  25  a student and the mother of two young children in Proctor  Okla   has been taking CBD oil to help calm her anxiety for about a year   I feel like it s just made my life easier   she said   I don t want to call it magical   she added  but she feels  1 000 times better  when she uses it  Dr  Blessing  who is studying the effects of CBD on PTSD  said the results of her clinical trials won t be available for years  Until more clinical trials are performed  there is only preliminary evidence to show that purified CBD can reduce anxiety  she added  When it comes to CBD   there are worse things  for sure   said Dr  Lucy Hutner  a reproductive psychiatrist in New York City  But  she added  if parents are feeling anxious  that can also be an opportunity to model mindful and effective ways to cope with stress for their children as an alternative to using a substance  In any case  parents need to be kind to themselves   We re all doing parenting in the way we do best   she said   Nobody does it perfectly  CBD Is Everywhere  but Scientists Still Don t Know Much

What Mr  Trump Said President Obama had child separation  Take a look  The press knows it  You know it  We all know it  I didn t have   I m the one that stopped it    But President Obama had the law  We changed the law  and I think the press should accurately report it  But of course they won t  False Mr  Trump has escalated a misleading defense of his administration s practice of breaking up families to outright revisionist history  There is no law that mandates family separation  let alone a law enacted under Mr  Obama  The practice is the result of a policy enacted by the Trump administration  and ended by Mr  Trump last June Last year  as the Trump administration faced backlash over its policy  top officials countered that Mr  Trump s predecessors had also separated families at the border  That was misleading  While previous administrations did break up families  it was rare   for example  in cases where there was doubt about the familial relationship between a child and an accompanying adult  according to former officials and immigration experts Neither former Presidents George W  Bush nor Barack Obama had a policy that had the effect of widespread family separation  Sarah Pierce of the Migration Policy Institute told The Times last June   Nothing like what the Trump administration is doing has occurred before   she said The Bush administration introduced a program in 2005 that also referred for prosecution immigrants illegally crossing the border  but it made an exception for parents with children  The Obama administration in 2014 detained families together  drawing its own criticisms and lawsuits Under Mr  Trump  the Justice Department announced its  zero tolerance policy  for illegally entering the United States in April 2018  describing it as  new  and in response to an increase in unauthorized border crossings that spring  The policy called for the criminal prosecution of everyone who enters the country illegally  As a result  nearly 3 000 children were forcibly separated from adult family members who were detained under the new policy that multiple top Trump officials have characterized as a deterrent After widespread condemnation from lawmakers in both parties  immigration activists and the United Nations  Mr  Trump signed an executive order in June that attempted to end the practice of family separation  It did not rescind the  zero tolerance  approach toward prosecuting migrants  but said it is now the policy of the Trump administration to keep families together At the White House on Tuesday  Mr  Trump said that his administration would not revive family separation as a practice  but he added   When you don t do it  it brings a lot more people to the border   Curious about the accuracy of a claim  Email factcheck nytimes com  

In the slaughterhouses where pigs are reduced to their constituent parts  the disassembly lines carry about 1 100 pigs per hour   a new carcass every three seconds  For decades  the federal government has sought to prevent food borne illnesses by stationing inspectors along the slaughter lines to eyeball the passing pigs for signs of disease and decay The Trump administration plans to overhaul this system  slashing the number of inspectors who work the lines and shifting some responsibility for food safety to the slaughterhouses The shift toward self regulation of slaughterhouses is part of a broader trend  The Trump administration also has proposed letting oil companies assume greater responsibility for the safety of offshore drilling platforms  and it is considering letting employees of nuclear power plants conduct some safety inspections in the place of federal regulators The system of slaughterhouse regulation is out of date  The industry has succeeded over time in sharply reducing the kinds of problems visible from the slaughterhouse floor   the government says its health inspectors increasingly are policing aesthetic issues   but the incidence of some illnesses caused by pork consumption has stopped falling  According to  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates   pork consumption causes more than 80 deaths a year and sickens more than half a million Americans  Unfortunately  there is no evidence that the Trump administration has a better plan The Clinton administration agreed in 1997 to let five hog plants adopt the inspection system that the Trump administration wants to embrace for the whole industry  In 2013  the Agriculture Department s inspector general reported that the pilot program had not demonstrably improved food safety  In response  the government defended the new system as no worse than the old one But there is some evidence of increased risk  Last year  the nonprofit Food   Water Watch used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain more recent inspection records for the plants in the pilot program  It found 22 instances between 2012 and 2016 in which companies were cited by the remaining federal inspectors for failing to identify and remove from the slaughter line a hog carcass that could cause food poisoning Using a pilot program is an excellent way to test a proposed change in regulation  But the point is to reach a clear conclusion  In this case  the government   rather astonishingly   has maintained the pilot program for two decades without proving that it works The Trump administration now says that expanding the pilot program to include a vast majority of the industry would significantly reduce episodes of salmonella poisoning  But outside experts point out that the administration simply assumes the testing methods that haven t worked in the pilot program will begin to yield better results The Trump administration also foresees considerable financial benefits   The government would save  6 4 million a year  while the industry s profits would rise by  47 3 million a year because slaughterhouses would be allowed to move hogs down the line at even higher speeds  But that would make life more difficult for the people who work the slaughter lines  The Agriculture Department insists it is not responsible for the safety of workers  and this is narrowly true  That job belongs to a different agency  But the White House is responsible for taking a broader view of proposed regulations  The government s tabulation of the costs and benefits needs to weigh the consequences for the people who work in the plants against the benefits for the people who own the plants In other cases  too  the administration is allowing self regulation contrary to evidence and experience  It is seeking to roll back some of the stringencies imposed on offshore oil drilling after the Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010  Before the blowout  which caused the largest maritime oil spill in American history  the government allowed oil companies to inspect and certify the safety of their own equipment  In the aftermath  the Obama administration required the use of third party inspectors approved by the government  The proposed rule would let companies choose their inspectors Similarly  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted this year to reverse some safeguards imposed on nuclear power plants following the March 2011 tsunami that caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan  And Annie Caputo  a member of the commission  told industry executives last month that she was open to letting plants  assume responsibility for some safety inspections The administration says it is reducing the cost of regulation without compromising public safety  But an administration that has acquired a reputation for indifference to scientific evidence needs to prove its changes are for the better RelatedWashington Rolls Back Safety Rules Inspired by Deepwater

WASHINGTON   The Latest on the Trump administration s stance on Iran  all times local  10 15 a m President Donald Trump says the U S  has designated Iran s Revolutionary Guard a  foreign terrorist organization  as part of an effort to increase international pressure on the country It s an unprecedented move because the U S  has never before used the designation for an entire foreign government entity Trump said in a statement Monday that the move  recognizes the reality  that Iran is a state sponsored supporter of terrorism and that the Guard is an active participant Administration officials have said the step will further isolate Iran and make clear that the U S  won t tolerate Iran s continued support for rebel groups and others that destabilize the Middle East But the designation may also have widespread implications for American personnel and policy in the region and elsewhere as Iran has threatened to retaliate    1 20 a m The Trump administration is planning to designate Iran s Revolutionary Guard a  foreign terrorist organization  in an unprecedented step to ramp up pressure on Tehran U S  officials say an announcement could come as early as Monday and the move could have widespread implications for U S  personnel and policy in the Middle East and elsewhere The Trump administration has escalated rhetoric against Iran for months  but this will mark the first such designation by any American administration of an entire foreign government entity Two U S  officials and a congressional aide confirmed the planned move and spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly The designation comes with sanctions  including freezes on some assets and a ban on Americans doing business with the group  

WASHINGTON   The White House moved to exert greater control over the federal regulatory process on Thursday by imposing additional scrutiny over independent government agencies when they establish new policies  guidelines or rules that affect large swaths of the economy The new policy was laid out in a memorandum written by Russell T  Vought  the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget  It broadens the scope of rules that would be subject to White House review and scrutiny by Congress through the Congressional Review Act The additional oversight would apply to agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission  the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Reserve  The White House review would not apply to the Fed s authority to set monetary policy but would affect its regulatory arm  including rules on the banking system  The move comes as President Trump  frustrated by the Fed s interest rate increases last year  has moved to install loyal allies on the Fed s seven member board Heightened scrutiny of federal rule making has been a longtime cause of Republicans  who view it as a way to limit government  The Trump administration has also been wary in some cases of independent agencies  which are often managed by both Republicans and Democrats Mr  Trump has made deregulation a pillar of his economic agenda and has instructed his officials to scale back rule making   and in some cases enforcement of existing rules   that he maintains will unleash business  The president has also signed numerous executive orders directing agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency to speed up projects and relax certain rules that businesses said were a hindrance Senator Patrick J  Toomey  Republican of Pennsylvania  applauded the move in a statement  saying  it appears that for those who want a government more accountable to the people  this announcement is a very positive development  But some consumer watchdog groups met the action with skepticism  This is a naked power grab on the part of the Trump administration   said Lisa Gilbert  the vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen   It puts agencies that are necessarily independent and intentionally kept firewalled from the administration right in the cross hairs and newly subject to undue influence  She added   The administration s thumb should not be on the scale for regulations that must be kept free from conflict  like financial regulations  campaign finance regulations and more  A senior administration official played down the scope of the memorandum  saying that it simply provided clarification that guidance documents were covered by Congressional Review Act statutes and needed to be reviewed to determine their economic effects According to the memorandum  proposals that have an effect of  100 million or more annually on the economy would be considered  major  and would require a review by Congress The administration official said Obama era guidance on joint employment and independent contractors that the Trump administration reversed in 2017 was an example of the type of policy that would be submitted for such a review That guidance had increased the likelihood that companies could be held responsible for labor violations committed by contractors and franchisees  

As baseless public health scares go  the one about police officers and nurses purportedly overdosing from passive fentanyl exposure should have been easy to dispel  Emergency workers across the country have reported dozens of such incidents in recent years  but their symptoms are often inconsistent with opioid poisoning  In some cases  officers have administered the overdose reversal drug Narcan to themselves   a feat that would be impossible in the midst of an actual overdose  In 2017  the nation s two leading toxicological societies published a joint statement explaining that for emergency medical workers  the risk of accidental opioid ingestion is  extremely low   Gloves almost always provide enough protection  masks are necessary only in exceptional cases Fentanyl is indeed one of the most powerful opioids ever created  It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  And it s true that even very small doses can be fatal  But merely touching the substance is not dangerous  Opioids have to enter the bloodstream to exert an effect  and not even the strongest ones can penetrate the skin quickly enough or in sufficient quantity for that to happen   if they could  people who are addicted to opioids would have no use for needles  As several journalists have pointed out  it took many years and many millions of dollars for scientists to develop patches capable of delivering pain medications through the skin  and those patches are still very slow and inefficient  The risk of accidental inhalation is only slightly more plausible  Fentanyl can enter the bloodstream through the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth  but it is not easily aerosolized  According to the toxicologists  joint statement  at the highest airborne concentrations found in industrial production facilities  an unprotected worker would need more than two hours to passively ingest even a medical dose of fentanyl  let alone a toxic one But so far  those facts have not stemmed the growing panic  Several states are planning to spend tens of millions of dollars on protective gear and screening equipment that most toxicologists say are unnecessary  As The Times has reported  prosecutors are pursuing charges ranging from reckless conduct to assault against people who expose police officers or emergency medical technicians to opioid powder  And addiction specialists are worried that health care providers will hesitate or outright refuse to treat people who are overdosing  just as doctors and dentists denied care to H I V  positive patients during the early days of the AIDS epidemic  That concern seems valid  given the stigma and vitriol that health care providers  law enforcement and the general public tend to heap on people who struggle with addiction It has not helped that federal agencies seem divided over   or perhaps confused by   the issue  The Drug Enforcement Administration has repeatedly warned that any contact with fentanyl can put an officer s life in danger  But safety recommendations published by an interagency committee  of which the D E A  was a part  echo toxicologists  assurances that such incidental exposure poses only a minimal risk  And videos produced by several federal entities contain conflicting accounts of what can and cannot happen to police officers who respond to opioid related calls As these mixed messages persist  so do reports of passive fentanyl toxicity  In the past six months alone  police officers in California  Iowa  Missouri  Massachusetts and Vermont have been hospitalized or reported feeling gravely ill after encountering opioids in the course of their work  many of them were given Narcan in response  even when their symptoms were more consistent with a panic attack than with an opioid overdose  Doctors and toxicologists who have studied the issue say that most of the cases reported so far are best explained by the so called nocebo effect  a phenomenon whereby people who believe they have encountered a toxic substance experience the expected symptoms of that exposure Misinformation is itself a hazardous substance  If care is delayed as a result of irrational fear  or stigma exacerbated  or resources diverted from needed treatments to unnecessary hazmat responses  more lives will be lost  Some 130 Americans already die every day from opioid overdoses  No part of this crisis needs to be exaggerated  It s already dire enough Related coverageMore on fentanyl China Bans All Types of Fentanyl  Cutting Supply of Deadly

WASHINGTON   The state of California filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to force two federal agencies to provide data they used to justify rolling back landmark Obama era vehicle emission standards  accusing the Trump administration of  willfully withholding  information In a lawsuit filed in U S  District Court in Washington  D C   California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Environmental Protection Agency failed to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request seeking data and analysis backing their proposal to freeze federal vehicle emission standards at 2020 levels through 2026 In addition to weaker fuel efficiency standards  the Trump administration proposal would strip California of the ability to impose stricter rules  which a dozen other states have adopted In 2011  California had agreed to harmonize its emissions with the Obama administration s vehicle emissions requirements through 2025  This lawsuit will break down their silence and secrecy   said Mary Nichols  chair of the California Air Resources Board   The public has a right to see all the facts and analysis used to support a rollback that increases oil consumption  hurts consumers  and pumps more air pollution and hundreds of million tons of climate changing gases into the atmosphere  The two federal agencies did not immediately comment The Obama era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46 7 miles per gallon by 2026  compared with 37 mpg under the Trump administration s preferred option  The lawsuit is the latest escalation in the feud between California and the Trump administration over vehicle emission standards In February  the White House ended negotiations with California over the plans to freeze fuel rules and pressured automakers to back their efforts California and 19 other states demanded the Trump administration abandon its proposal  States sued last year over the EPA s decision to revisit its January 2017 determination the 2025 rules were feasible  Automakers like General Motors Co  Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp oppose a freeze but want requirements reduced to account for changes in oil prices and consumer demand The EPA is on track to release final emissions rules by  spring or early summer   Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters on Thursday  Wheeler hopes California will not sue EPA once it releases final requirements  but if it does he suggested California do it quickly  to ensure regulatory certainty  Deputy NHTSA Administrator Heidi King said on Friday that dramatically higher fuel efficiency rules can  hinder safety  by raising the price of new  safer vehicles   Reporting by David Shepardson  Editing by Leslie Adler

There s never been a study like it before  and there probably never will be again Starting in March 2015  astronaut Scott Kelly spent 340 days aboard the International Space Station  A team of scientists tracked his body s responses to long term spaceflight in painstaking detail  They simultaneously tracked his identical twin brother  Mark  on Earth On Thursday  the scientists began publishing the huge trove of results from the so called NASA Twins Study   90 pages  all told  and that s just the first installment  Here s a guide to what they ve found   so far  Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar  Space travel changes the body Scientists tracked a huge range of measurements in the NASA Twins Study  from Mr  Kelly s performance on cognition tests to levels of gene activity in his cells  Many of the molecular tests had never been carried out on astronauts before  The exams required Mr  Kelly to draw his own blood and to send fresh samples back to Earth in a Soyuz supply craft  Within 48 hours  researchers were analyzing the samples at NASA labs In one test  researchers broke open Mr  Kelly s white blood cells and searched for molecular signals from each of his genes to see whether they were active  The scientists identified thousands of genes that ramped up their pace  By looking at what those genes do  the team gleaned some clues as to why they became active in Mr  Kelly  Some are known to be triggered by stress  so it was no surprise to find that Mr  Kelly s immune system also was on high alert In another test  the researchers scrutinized molecular caps on the ends of Mr  Kelly s chromosomes  called telomeres  Telomeres shorten with age  and stress can shorten them further  But Mr  Kelly s telomeres actually grew longer on average during his time in space Scott Kelly Spent a Year Taking Photos in Space  They re Beautiful In orbit aboard the International Space Station  the astronaut wasn t just gathering data for NASA s Twins Study  He also produced some  well  stellar images April 12  2019But it s not clear what the changes mean Human biology is complicated and mysterious  even here on Earth  So documenting changes that Mr  Kelly experienced in space won t automatically help scientists understand the causes For example  why did his telomeres get longer  The Twins Study researchers are still trying to figure it out  It might have something to do with Mr  Kelly s carefully designed  nutrient rich diet   or perhaps the stress of space travel triggered stem cells to wake up and start multiplying Another mystery lies in the very design of the experiment  NASA only examined a single astronaut in space  comparing his responses to his genetically identical brother  It s hard to know if all astronauts would experience the same changes   or if some of those changes are flukes of his own experience and genetic makeup The most worrisome findings  genetic mutations and lower scores on cognition tests Radiation can trigger certain mutations that may increase a person s risk of developing cancer  And there s more radiation in Earth orbit than on the surface of the planet  In his 340 days aboard the space station  Mr  Kelly was exposed to an estimated 48 times more radiation than he would have been subjected to had he spent a year on the planet Scientists were able to observe the appearance of radiation induced mutations in Mr  Kelly s cells  The mutations were still present in Mr  Kelly months after his return  suggesting that he ll carry them forward in his life  possibly causing a modest increase in his risk of cancer   Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  So it s a bit worrying that a long term trip to Mars would expose astronauts to eight times more radiation than Mr  Kelly received In addition  Mr  Kelly did worse on cognition tests even six months after landing  making more mistakes and responding more slowly  It s possible that the physical demands of spaceflight were to blame  or that unconsciously his motivation had decreased  These unexpected declines led some researchers to worry about how ready astronauts would be for a challenging landing on Mars after many months in deep space If we attempt a trip to Mars  we ll need to prepare NASA understands that long duration spaceflight could pose serious challenges to astronauts  By studying those challenges aboard the space station  the agency has been trying to quantify those risks  And on Earth  scientists have been investigating potential countermeasures Take radiation  On the space station  Mr  Kelly s cells switched on genes known to help repair DNA  It s possible that his cells actually undid a lot of mutations right after they arose  Researchers are investigating a variety of compounds that might spur the cells of astronauts to repair even more damage But such drugs might not be enough to handle  say  an unexpected solar flare  which would spray vast amounts of radiation  Some experts have speculated that spaceships would need a shielded room where astronauts could hide until flares were over  Although that might protect astronauts in theory  it would also add a lot of extra weight to a mission to Mars  And that s just one of the biological risks that scientists will have to plan for ImageScott Kelly

earthbound twin  Mark  The results hint at what humans will have to endure on long journeys through space April 11  2019 

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is preparing to designate Iran s Revolutionary Guards Corps as a  foreign terrorist organization    an unprecedented move that could have widespread implications for U S  personnel and policy U S  officials say an announcement could come as early as Monday  after a monthslong escalation in the administration s rhetoric against Iran The move would be the first such designation by any U S  administration of an entire foreign government entity  although portions of the Guard Corps have been targeted before Two U S  officials and a congressional aide are confirming the move  They re not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and are speaking on condition of anonymity The designation comes with sanctions  including freezes on some assets and a ban on Americans doing business with the group  

NEW YORK   A second federal judge has blocked the Department of Homeland Security from forcing tens of thousands of Haitians to return to their native country U S  District Judge William F  Kuntz in New York issued a nationwide injunction Thursday preventing the department from terminating Temporary Protected Status for Haitians Kuntz ruled on a lawsuit filed by Haitians in Florida and New York that challenged the Trump administration s decision to end the status granted to Haiti after its 2010 earthquake The trial in federal court in Brooklyn stemmed from one of seven lawsuits filed by immigrants and advocates over the 2017 move to end the program  The program has allowed about 300 000 people from Haiti  El Salvador  Nicaragua  Sudan and other countries to stay in the U S  for years following natural disasters or violence in their home countries In October  a California judge hearing another of the lawsuits temporarily blocked the changes covering people from those four countries  forcing the administration to maintain their protected status for now But the Brooklyn case  which covered only Haitians  was the first time the administration s move to end the program had been put on trial Kuntz said the plaintiffs offered persuasive evidence that the policy change was motivated by  a discriminatory purpose of removing non white immigrants to the country  His 145 page ruling cited evidence that officials from Homeland Security and other federal agencies  reverse engineered the TPS review process to achieve the desired political outcome  the termination of Haiti s TPS  A spokesperson for Homeland Security said in an email the department is  complying with intervening orders  but additional change is needed  What is often not reported is that the Trump Administration has forcefully advocated for Congressional action to provide legal status for long standing TPS beneficiaries in good standing  a change to the law is needed  not judicial intervention   the spokesperson The government is expected to appeal the ruling In response to the ruling in California  the Justice Department denied the administration had done anything improper and said the ruling  usurps the role of the executive branch  An attorney for the plaintiffs  Per Sejal Zota of the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild  said the ruling  vindicates the brave struggle of Haitian TPS holders who challenged Trump  because the law was on their side   

President Trump  reversing an agreement negotiated by the Obama administration  abruptly ended a deal between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that had eased the path for players to compete in the United States without defecting from their country The Trump administration said that the deal constituted a violation of trade laws because the Cuban federation was part of the government in Havana   a departure from the previous administration s stance In a letter to M L B  s outside counsel  which was obtained by The New York Times  Nikole Thomas  the acting assistant director for licensing at the Office of Foreign Assets Control  outlined the U S  government s opposition to the deal  which stipulated that the Cuban federation would receive 25 percent of a player s signing bonus for a minor league player and between 15 and 25 percent for a major league player The letter said that the O F A C  had  determined that M L B  s payments to the Cuban Baseball Federation are not authorized  because  a payment to the Cuban Baseball Federation is a payment to the Cuban government  News of the administration s rejection of M L B  s plan was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and ESPN Cuban sports entities  including its baseball federation and Olympic committee  have argued they are independent of the central government  but the Trump administration rejected that assessment  The U S  does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society   said Garrett Marquis  a spokesman for the National Security Council   The administration looks forward to working with M L B  to identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents  and not as property of the Cuban state  In a statement  M L B  said   We stand by the goal of the agreement  which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba  One M L B  official  who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter  said the league had requested a face to face meeting with U S  government agencies but were not granted one  M L B  was prepared to base its argument on the fact that the Obama administration had given it a license in 2016 to do business with the Cuban baseball federation  and that a Trump era national security presidential memorandum published on June 16  2017 promised the agreement would be grandfathered in  The memorandum stated that any new regulations  will not affect existing contracts and licenses  Several U S  business entities  including travel and telecommunications companies  do business in Cuba  But M L B  officials worried that  as a high profile organization  its deal would be challenged by hard liners in the government John Bolton  the national security adviser  seemed to foreshadow the move on Sunday when he tweeted   Cuba wants to use baseball players as economic pawns   selling their rights to Major League Baseball  America s national pastime should not enable the Cuban regime s support for Maduro in Venezuela  Cuba has produced some of the best players currently in the major leagues  including Aroldis Chapman of the Yankees  Yoenis Cespedes of the Mets and Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox  They and most other Cuban players in M L B  left their country illegally  in some cases smuggled out by disreputable agents and human traffickers on speedboats and rafts over dangerous waters  It s bad in the sense that they can t come anymore in the formal  legal way that was planned   Chapman said on Monday For some players  the dangers continued after they arrived because they were at the mercy of the smugglers  To this date  I am still harassed   Abreu  who has played for the Chicago White Sox since 2014  said in a statement issued at the time the deal was announced in December M L B  and its players union sought to eliminate that dangerous process by creating a posting system similar to the one used with players from Japan and South Korea  Under the plan  a major league team seeking to sign a Cuban player would pay a posting fee to the Cuban federation  which would in turn allow the player to leave the country and return home at will  Just days ago  the Cuban federation released the names of 34 players it said were eligible to sign with M L B  The objective of the agreement  which is the product of years of negotiations with the F C B   is to end the dangerous trafficking of Cuban baseball players who desire to play professional baseball in the United States   M L B  s lawyers said in their petition to the Treasury Department in January M L B  and the Cuban baseball federation commenced talks after the United States and Cuba began a thaw in relations under the Obama administration in 2014  Soon after that  baseball s commissioner s office secured a license from the Treasury Department to legally begin negotiations with the Cubans After announcing its agreement in December  M L B  quietly sought to convince administration officials   who immediately criticized the plan publicly   that it fit within the guidelines for an exemption to the trade laws  At the same time  M L B  officials were also resigned to the political opposition to the deal and the possibility of returning to the old method of signing Cuban players  

WASHINGTON   National security adviser John Bolton said Friday that he will travel to Miami next week to outline steps the administration is taking to confront what he says are threats from the  troika of tyranny   Cuba  Venezuela and Nicaragua John Bolton said in a tweet that he is delivering a speech on Wednesday  the 58th anniversary of the United States  failed attempt to overthrow the Cuban government in the 1961  Bay of Pigs  invasion  His speech will be at the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association  which endorsed Trump for president Miami is home to thousands of exiles from Cuba  Venezuela and Nicaragua In a speech there last year  Bolton discussed newly released sanctions against Venezuela and Cuba and promised additional penalties against Nicaragua as he laid out the administration s hardline policy toward the three countries  Bolton called them the  troika of tyranny  and said they represented destructive forces of  oppression  socialism and totalitarianism  Also on Wednesday  the administration is expected to announce its decision on whether to allow lawsuits against companies that profit from U S  linked properties confiscated after Cuba s 1959 socialist revolution The Helms Burton Act lets Americans use U S  courts to sue non American companies that use property that was seized after Fidel Castro s revolution  Every president has suspended the law since it was passed in 1996  But in a move against Cuba  the Trump administration announced last month that such suits could be filed It was seen as a largely symbolic move  The announcement limited lawsuits to about 200 Cuban businesses and government agencies that are already subject to U S  sanctions because of their ties to Cuban military and intelligence ministries

WILMINGTON  Del    The U S  government can continue at least temporarily to send asylum seekers back to Mexico after President Donald Trump scored a rare ruling in his favor on Friday from the U S  9th Circuit Court of Appeals The asylum program was set to be shut down at 8 p m  EDT  midnight GMT  by an order issued on Monday by U S  District Court Judge Richard Seeborg  but the Trump administration had asked for the Court of Appeals in San Francisco to intervene The Court of Appeals issued a two paragraph order saying the lower court injunction was temporarily stayed while the parties prepare to submit arguments next week on the government s request for a longer stay that would remain in place for the months long appeals process The government told the Court of Appeals in papers filed late Thursday that the United States faced  a humanitarian and security crisis  at the southern border and needed to the policy to deal with surging number of refugees Seeborg had ruled on Monday the policy was contrary to U S  immigration law and ordered a nationwide injunction to halt the program  but delayed implementation of his order to allow the government to appeal  This is an interim step while the court considers the government s stay request   said a statement from Judy Rabinovitz  a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who represented plaintiffs in the case and who opposed the stay Since January  the administration has sent more than 1 000 asylum seekers  mostly from Central America  back to Mexico to wait the months or years it can take to process claims through an overloaded immigration system  Although it is appealing and the lower court order had yet to take effect  Reuters reporters confirmed that the Trump administration was allowing some asylum seekers from Mexico to return to the United States Trump has bristled at limits on his administration s ability to detain asylum seekers while they fight deportation  and the administration was in the midst of expanding the program when Seeborg blocked it The 9th Circuit Court has been a frequent target for Trump s criticisms of the judicial system  which has blocked his immigration policies on numerous occasions After Seeborg ruled on Monday  Trump tweeted   A 9th Circuit Judge just ruled that Mexico is too dangerous for migrants  So unfair to the U S  OUT OF CONTROL    Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington  Delaware  Editing by Tom Brown  

Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines   and the power brokers who shape them           Aircraft manufacturers like Boeing rarely face a criminal investigation resulting from plane crashes  But last fall a grand jury in Washington  D C   issued a subpoena for records after the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max plane  In the wake of the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash involving similar circumstances  the F B I  has joined that investigation The New York Times described Boeing s push to develop the 737 Max as  frenetic  and reported that prosecutors and regulators are investigating whether that led Boeing  to miss crucial safety risks and to underplay the need for pilot training  But what federal criminal laws are the investigators looking at as they pore over Boeing s records  Both the Justice Department and Boeing have declined to comment on the criminal inquiry One statute they may consider is the federal false statements law  The broad statute is used when a company provides information to a federal agency like the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the safety of a plane and makes it a crime to provide an agency with  any materially false  fictitious  or fraudulent statement or representation  about a matter that comes within its jurisdiction Investigators will examine whether Boeing made any false statements regarding a new software system added to avoid stalls in Boeing s 737 Max series  Investigators suspect that faulty data from sensors on both planes may have caused the system  known as MCAS  to malfunction  Boeing s chief executive has said that the automated flight system played a role in the two crashes Boeing also charged extra for two safety features on its 737 Max jets that might have helped the pilots detect erroneous sensor readings to avoid problems with the software Investigators likely will examine whether Boeing made any misstatements about the upgrades or if the company failed to disclose possible safety problems to the F A A  without those upgrades  The false statement law covers not only outright lies  but also submissions in which a person  falsifies  conceals  or covers up  information submitted to a federal agency  There have been a number of prosecutions involving false statements to the F A A  under the statute  Most of those cases  though  involve pilots who fail to disclose information that might result in the agency revoking or refusing to renew a license The challenge to bringing a false statement charge is that the government must show they were made  knowingly and willfully   That means negligence by Boeing would not be enough to prove a violation The criminal investigation may also examine whether Boeing violated a law adopted in 2000  The statute makes it a crime to  knowingly and with intent to defraud  to falsify or conceal a material fact about an aircraft part  or to make  any materially fraudulent representation  about a part  It can be applied to conduct outside the United States so long as the company is organized under the laws of this country  which  as a Delaware corporation  Boeing is The aircraft fraud parts law carries stiff penalties  including a fine of  10 million for each violation by a company and a sentence of up to life in prison for individuals charged if the part involved was the  proximate cause  of a malfunction that resulted in death  A conviction also could result in a criminal forfeiture of  any property constituting  or derived from  any proceeds that the person obtained  directly or indirectly  as a result of the offense  If there is evidence of fraud and not just false statements  the Justice Department could also pursue a wire fraud case  Prosecutors used that law against General Motors for the failure of ignition switches in certain models that caused a number of deaths  along with a charge under the false statement law  In addition  the auto parts maker Takata pleaded guilty to a wire fraud charge for installing faulty airbag inflaters Federal prosecutors have a number of options if there is evidence that Boeing intentionally provided false or misleading information to the F A A  The investigation is still in a preliminary stage  and there is no guarantee that a criminal case will emerge  For the company  there is danger in any criminal investigation because even the hint of possible misconduct could have significant consequences as it tries to deal with the fallout from crashes of its best selling aircraft  

A federal appeals court said Friday that the Trump administration could temporarily continue to force migrants seeking asylum in the United States to wait in Mexico while their cases are decided A three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a stay of a lower court ruling four days earlier that blocked the administration s protocol  The appeals court will consider next week whether to extend that stay   and allow the Trump administration policy to remain in effect for longer The administration in December  announced its new policy  called the migration protection protocols  arguing that it would help stop people from using the asylum process to enter the country and remain there illegally  President Trump has long been angered by so called catch and release policies  under which asylum seekers are temporarily allowed in the United States while they wait for their court hearings On Monday  Judge Richard Seeborg of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued an injunction against Mr  Trump s new protocols  saying that the president did not have the power to enforce them and that they violated immigration laws Judge Seeborg said in his ruling that the protocols did not include  sufficient safeguards  to comply with the Department of Homeland Security s obligation against returning migrants to places where their  life or freedom would be threatened  On Friday  as Judge Seeborg s injunction was set to go into effect  a three judge panel for the Ninth Circuit issued the temporary stay In a tweet late Friday night  President Trump wrote   Finally  great news at the Border   He has previously criticized the Ninth Circuit  which is based in San Francisco  saying that the court always ruled against him  While that is not always true  the administration s track record in the circuit has been poor The Justice Department  which appealed Judge Seeborg s decision  argued that the injunction would  impose immediate  substantial harm on the United States  including by diminishing the executive branch s ability to work effectively with Mexico to manage the crisis on our shared border  The Ninth Circuit will consider next week whether to keep the stay   and Mr  Trump s protocols   in place during the appeal Judy Rabinovitz  the deputy director of the Immigrants  Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union  who argued the case  said she expected that decision to come next week  The question will be  can the government continue to implement the policy while it appeals it to the Ninth Circuit   she said   Obviously  we don t think it should be able to  She called the policy unlawful and cruel  We think it should be stopped   she said Lawyers for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment The appeals court s decision comes as the nation s immigration system may have reached a breaking point as migrants increasingly arrive at the country s southwestern border with Mexico The flow of migrant families has reached record levels  with February totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year  Many are seeking asylum  in which they have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or testimony that establishes the  well founded  fear that they would face danger if they return home The Trump administration s migration protection protocols were an attempt to deter migrants  Mexico s government reluctantly agreed to house the migrants in December  

SAN DIEGO   The Latest on a court ruling that would have prevented the Trump administration from returning asylum seekers to Mexico to await court hearings  all times local  4 45 p m A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a judge s order that would have stopped the Trump administration from returning asylum seekers to Mexico The 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals issued a temporary stay Friday A three judge panel set a Tuesday deadline for civil liberties groups to submit arguments why the order blocking the Trump administration should take effect  It set a Wednesday deadline for the government to argue why the policy should remain in place Judge Richard Seeborg ruled Monday in favor of civil liberties groups who want to halt the practice while their lawsuit moves forward challenging the policy  His order had been set to take effect Friday afternoon Seeborg said the policy violates U S  law by failing to evaluate dangers migrants face in Mexico The government says Seeborg s order is erroneous and endangers the public during a humanitarian crisis at the border    10 54 a m The Trump administration is asking an appeals court to let it continue returning asylum seekers to Mexico to await court hearings while it challenges a San Francisco judge s order that would block the policy The government requested a stay with the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals to prevent the lower court order from taking effect Friday afternoon Judge Richard Seeborg ruled Monday in favor of civil liberties groups to halt the practice while their lawsuit moves forward challenging the policy  His order will take effect at 5 p m  Friday unless a stay is issued Seeborg said the policy violates U S  law by failing to adequately evaluate dangers migrants face in Mexico The government says Seeborg s order is erroneous and endangers the public during a humanitarian crisis at the border  

As President Trump continues his mad purge of the Department of Homeland Security  a sinister figure is emerging as the driving force behind all the chaos  Stephen Miller  the president s top immigration adviser A fierce restrictionist  Mr  Miller seems to have rarely met an immigrant he didn t want to deport  He is among the hardest of hard liners  known for spurring his boss to pursue ever more draconian measures Not that Mr  Trump needs much encouragement  He did  after all  ascend to the White House on an immigrant bashing  ethnonationalist platform as dishonest as it was divisive  Many of the administration s uglier policy ideas have been a result of Mr  Trump s failure to deliver on his signature campaign promise of a  big  beautiful  border wall  Small wonder Mr  Miller has emerged as his favorite consigliere on such matters  Mr  Miller s preferred approach to immigration and border security is straight out of Ann Coulter s fever dreams  He was a chief architect of the travel ban on citizens from Muslim majority countries  He favors the building of tent cities at the border for warehousing asylum seekers  He s agitating to end the 20 day limit on detaining migrant children  And he wants to reinstate the practice of snatching migrant children from their families   though this time he d like to give parents a  binary choice  of having their kids taken from them or held with them in detention indefinitely Mr  Miller is being credited with the blood bath at the Department of Homeland Security  Since Friday  a handful of top leaders have been  or are soon to be  shown the door  including the head of the Secret Service  the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  who was never quite ruthless enough for the president s or Mr  Miller s taste  More firings are expected as Mr  Miller moves to remake the department in his image Bottom line  Stephen Miller is a man whose anti immigration zeal remains unfettered by concern for the law  international norms or basic humanity And yet  The portrait of the 33 year old policy adviser as a figure of singular evil is both overly simplistic and counterproductive  Sure  the guy is a force for darkness  easing the president ever further into nativism  But no matter how much of the administration s immigration agenda Mr  Miller has been responsible for  it s taken a village to make that vision a reality  Giving too much credit to any one person builds up Mr  Miller  undeservedly  as a Machiavellian genius and lets many other folks off the hook A society does not fall because of a small coterie of bad actors  Widespread rot requires legions of enablers  many of whom are driven by varying blends of personal ambition  ideological expedience and the self aggrandizing delusion that  through their invaluable counsel  they can save the state from total destruction Expect increasingly to hear this last rationalization from former administration officials starting redemption tours as they resume life outside the Trump bubble Advisers like Kellyanne Conway  lawmakers like Senator Lindsey Graham and the former House Speaker Paul Ryan  party apparatchiks like the Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel and a whole host of Trump friendly media personalities may not personally share the president s views or policy aims  But their willingness to swallow some of the administration s cruelest acts renders them complicit  Neither their reputations nor their consciences should be wiped clean Take Ms  Nielsen  Since her departure was announced  she s enjoyed some sympathy for having behaved less viciously than some in the White House desired  Throughout her tenure  stories bubbled up about how she incurred Mr  Trump s wrath by dragging her feet on policies that would have run afoul of the law or thrown the nation into chaos  But she still carried out and aggressively enforced her share of atrocities Now  defenders are portraying the woman who was in charge of caging migrant children as a hapless victim of the administration s more unhinged forces  The so called immigration hard liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration  giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems   Thad Bingel  a homeland security official under President George W  Bush and former aide to Ms  Nielsen  told The Times   They apparently don t want anyone like a Secretary Nielsen or Secretary Kelly  who deals in reality  to tell them or the president any of this  No doubt  Ms  Nielsen had a difficult  perhaps impossible  job  But it was no profile in courage for her to cling to her morally untenable position until Mr

WASHINGTON   President Trump s purge of the nation s top homeland security officials is a sign that he is preparing to unleash an even fiercer assault on immigration  including a possible return of his controversial decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents  current and former administration officials said Monday Mr  Trump shook up the ranks of his top immigration officials after spending months demanding that they take tougher action to stop the surge in migrant families at the border and seething about what he considers their overly legalistic refusals to do what he has said was necessary That anger was underscored on Monday when a judge blocked Mr  Trump s efforts to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases proceed   a practice that immigration advocates called inhumane and illegal  Judge Richard Seeborg of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that existing law did not give Mr  Trump the power to enforce the policy  known as  migrant protection protocols  The immediate targets of the president s growing fury about the situation at the border were the officials who he saw as insufficiently steely minded  Kirstjen Nielsen  who resigned  Sunday as the secretary of homeland security  and Ron Vitiello  whose nomination to permanently lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement was pulled after Mr  Trump remarked that  we want to go in a tougher direction  But the longer term effect of the eruption of Oval Office frustration is likely to be a burst of hard line policies that stand out even in an administration that has pursued an unprecedented series of executive actions and rules changes aimed at reducing legal and illegal immigration into the United States In addition to urging Mr  Trump to revisit the idea of family separation  several of the president s closest immigration confidants have been pushing him to consider even harsher measures Those include further limits on who can seek asylum  stronger action to close ports of entry along the Mexican border  an executive order to end birthright citizenship  more aggressive construction of a border wall  and a more robust embrace of active duty troops to secure the border against illegal immigration In an administration that is famous for chaos and last minute decision making  it is unclear on which of those policies the president might choose to move forward  But by removing Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Vitiello and perhaps others  Mr  Trump is getting rid of voices who sometimes cautioned him against taking actions they believed to be illegal or unwise  There was a perception that Secretary Nielsen was not as committed to the sort of full throated approach that others in the administration  including the White House  were seeking   said Seth Grossman  who served as deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2015 He said Ms  Nielsen s exit and Mr  Vitiello s step back  signals there is an intention to pursue more aggressive policies  Three senior administration officials with knowledge of the president s conversations over the past several months confirmed that Mr  Trump has repeatedly told aides that he wants to restart the family separation policy  One of the officials said the president had made it clear to aides that he liked Ms  Nielsen personally  but was critical of her job performance  All three officials spoke about the internal discussions on the condition of anonymity Stephen Miller  the architect of Mr  Trump s immigration agenda and one of the president s closest advisers in the White House  has been an advocate for a modified version of the family separation policy known as  binary choice  Others  including Kris Kobach  the former Kansas secretary of state and an informal immigration adviser  and Stephen K  Bannon  the president s former chief strategist  have also been urging tougher actions Under a binary choice policy  which is highly controversial  migrant parents would be given a choice of whether to voluntarily allow their children to be separated from them  or to waive their child s humanitarian protections so the family can be detained together  indefinitely  in jail like conditions  Immigration advocates have said the idea is inhumane and would be found illegal by courts The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other Ms  Nielsen was the head of the department during the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy last year that led to the separation of thousands of families  More than 2 700 children were separated from their parents at the border under that policy to prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally  even those with families seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds Mr  Trump eventually relented on the family separations  and a federal judge in California halted them in June  But in January  the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services reported that thousands more families might have been separated than previously reported While Mr  Trump has been hampered by the law in his efforts to impose some new enforcement policies  there are certain things he can do without congressional approval Those include shutting down ports of entries along the southwestern border and slowing down the process for both illegal and legal immigration Last month  he closed American field offices abroad that had helped facilitate immigration applications  Mr  Trump has also limited the number of people who can request asylum each day through a process known as  metering   and he has threatened to shut down traffic lanes and tariff trucks at the ports of entry Jonathan Meyer  a former deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security  said the Trump administration will continue to pursue hard line immigration policies because they are important to the president s political supporters  who helped fuel Mr  Trump s success in the 2016 presidential campaign  It appears that at times it s less important in this administration  whether they lose or win in court  than to just say they ve been able to have done it and have it as a talking point   Mr  Meyer said   And have an opportunity to criticize the courts if they lose  Mr  Meyer said installing a new secretary at the department will further embolden Mr  Trump  He s willing to move forward and do things even when he knows he s going to be sued for it and when the legality is in question   Mr  Meyer said   If that s the position you take and if you have people willing to implement that strategy  there s a lot of things you can do  But eventually you re going to be hit with a temporary restraining order  Mr  Grossman said Mr  Trump s personnel moves were indeed a signal that the administration would embrace aggressive policies  But he added that Mr  Trump has threatened to enact such policies before  only to back off The president could also be stymied by further court rulings blocking his efforts to crack down on immigrants On Monday in California  the judge said in his ruling that in addition to violating immigration laws  the protocols did not include  sufficient safeguards  to comply with the Department of Homeland Security s obligation against returning migrants to places where their  life or freedom would be threatened  Immigration advocates hailed the decision  calling it the latest victory in the legal battles with the Trump administration that began when the president imposed a travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries just days after taking office in 2017  Try as it may  the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States   said Judy Rabinovitz  the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants  Rights Project  who argued the case The Trump administration had negotiated the protocols with the Mexican government because of the president s longstanding anger with so called catch and release policies in which asylum seekers are temporarily released into the United States while they wait for their court hearings The policy of forcing some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico was an effort to stop that from happening  But the court ruling means that the president will have to abandon it  at least for the time being  

SAN DIEGO   The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year  a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47 000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1  2017 and June 25  2018   the day before U S  District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families  The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation   for example  children under 5 The administration would provide information on separated families on a rolling basis to the American Civil Liberties Union  which sued to reunite families and criticized the proposed timeline on Saturday  We strongly oppose a plan that could take up to two years to locate these families   said Lee Gelernt  the ACLU s lead attorney   The government needs to make this a priority  Sabraw ordered last year that more than 2 700 children in government care on June 26  2018 be reunited with their families  which has largely been accomplished  Then  in January  the U S  Health and Human Services Department s internal watchdog reported that thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017  The department s inspector general said the precise number was unknown The judge ruled last month that he could hold the government accountable for families that were separated before his June order and asked the government submit a proposal for the next steps  A hearing is scheduled April 16 Sheer volume makes the job different than identifying children who were in custody at the time of the judge s June order  Jonathan White  a commander of the U S  Public Health Service and Health and Human Services  point person on family reunification  said in an affidavit White  whose work has drawn strong praise from the judge  would lead the effort to identify additional families on behalf of Health and Health and Human Services with counterparts at Customs and Border Protection and U S  Immigration and Customs and Enforcement  Dr  Barry Graubard  a statistics expert at the National Cancer Institute  developed a system to flag for early attention those most likely to have been separated The vast majority of separated children are released to relatives  but many are not parents  Of children released in the 2017 fiscal year  49 percent went to parents  41 percent to close relatives such as an aunt  uncle  grandparent or adult sibling and 10 percent to distant relatives  family friends and others The government s proposed model to flag still separated children puts a higher priority on the roughly half who were not released to a parent  Other signs of likely separation include children under 5  younger children traveling without a sibling and those who were detained in the Border Patrol s El Paso  Texas  sector  where the administration ran a trial program that involved separating nearly 300 family members from July to November 2017 Saturday marks the anniversary of the administration s  zero tolerance  policy to criminally prosecute every adult who enters the country illegally from Mexico  The administration retreated in June amid an international uproar by generally exempting adults who come with their children  The policy now applies only to single adults

A prominent Texas medical school will stop considering race or ethnicity in deciding whether to admit applicants  as part of an agreement with the Education Department s civil rights office The president of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center signed the agreement in February  14 years after the department began investigating a complaint filed by an anti affirmative action group  The agreement is the first of its kind for the Education Department under Secretary Betsy DeVos  and comes as the Trump administration continues its hard turn against the use of race in admissions Roger Clegg  general counsel for the Center for Equal Opportunity  which filed the original complaint  said on Tuesday that the agreement could pave the way for similar actions at other schools  It shows that the Trump administration is serious about enforcing the civil rights laws in a way that protects the rights of all Americans to be free from discrimination   Mr  Clegg said   The more schools that stop using racial preferences  the harder it will be for other schools to continue using racial preferences  Affirmative action programs are under renewed scrutiny in courts and by federal authorities  Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are both facing court challenges to their admissions procedures that could reach the Supreme Court  The Trump administration is investigating allegations of discrimination against Asian American applicants at Harvard and Yale The administration has made clear its position on the use of race in admissions  abandoning Obama era policies that argued for the  compelling interests  of diversity to college campuses and encouraging race neutral admissions methods Jin Hee Lee  senior deputy director of litigation at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc   said the Texas Tech agreement was part of a broader pattern of chipping away at affirmative action  In the larger context of this administration s civil rights record  it s clear that this is yet another attack on education equity   Ms  Lee said   We will continue to take steps to protect efforts aimed at improving education equity throughout the country  The complaint by the Center for Equal Opportunity  which describes itself as a conservative civil rights organization  came after a 2003 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Grutter v  Bollinger  In that decision  the court upheld the use of race as a factor in admission to the University of Michigan Law School  saying that the school had a compelling interest in achieving diversity Soon after  the Health Sciences Center School of Medicine and Texas Tech University  the undergraduate campus in the Texas Tech system  announced that they would begin considering race in admissions  Mr  Clegg challenged the decision on the ground that race should be used only as a last resort But for the fall 2014 class  the undergraduate campus removed any consideration of race in admissions  As a result  the Education Department dismissed the case The department continued to investigate the Health Sciences Center  and found that the medical school was continuing to use race conscious admissions  according to documents in the case The policies had a significant effect on the makeup of the medical school  Enrollment went from 9 percent Hispanic in the class that entered in 2004 to 16 percent in the class that entered in 2018  The university said that it was trying to recruit more Hispanic students in part to send more people to practice medicine in underserved communities in West Texas  according to documents in the case Mr  Clegg said the investigation  which had begun during the George W  Bush administration  had lasted through the Obama years   which suggests that even under a liberal Democratic administration  there were problems  with admissions practices The medical school defended race conscious admissions by saying it needed to recruit students who showed the  cultural sensitivity  that would allow them to serve racially diverse patients  according to a letter from the Education Department s civil rights office  Federal officials were concerned that the medical school s admissions process violated civil rights law Eric D  Bentley  vice chancellor and general counsel of the Texas Tech University System  said in a letter to the civil rights office that while the medical school believed it was in compliance with the law  it was agreeing to stop using race in admissions  in an effort to resolve this matter and focus on educating future health care providers  The decision was effective March 1  according to the agreement  and set a deadline of Sept  1 to revise all admissions and recruitment materials to reflect the changes  It did not  the agreement said  constitute an admission that the university had run afoul of civil rights law

There s a lot we don t know about the legacy Donald Trump will leave behind  And it is  of course  hugely important what happens in the 2020 election  But one thing seems sure  Even if he s a one term president  Trump will have caused  directly or indirectly  the premature deaths of a large number of Americans Some of those deaths will come at the hands of right wing  white nationalist extremists  who are a rapidly growing threat  partly because they feel empowered by a president who calls them  very fine people  Some will come from failures of governance  like the inadequate response to Hurricane Maria  which surely contributed to the high death toll in Puerto Rico   Reminder  Puerto Ricans are U S  citizens  Some will come from the administration s continuing efforts to sabotage Obamacare  which have failed to kill health reform but have stalled the decline in the number of uninsured  meaning that many people still aren t getting the health care they need  Of course  if Trump gets his way and eliminates Obamacare altogether  things on this front will get much  much worse But the biggest death toll is likely to come from Trump s agenda of deregulation   or maybe we should call it  deregulation   because his administration is curiously selective about which industries it wants to leave alone Consider two recent events that help capture the deadly strangeness of what s going on One is the administration s plan for hog plants to take over much of the federal responsibility for food safety inspections  And why not  It s not as if we ve seen safety problems arise from self regulation in  say  the aircraft industry  have we  Or as if we ever experience major outbreaks of food borne illness  Or as if there was a reason the U S  government stepped in to regulate meatpacking in the first place Now  you could see the Trump administration s willingness to trust the meat industry to keep our meat safe as part of an overall attack on government regulation  a willingness to trust profit making businesses to do the right thing and let the market rule  And there s something to that  but it s not the whole story  as illustrated by another event  Trump s declaration the other day that wind turbines cause cancer Now  you could put this down to personal derangement  Trump has had an irrational hatred for wind power ever since he failed to prevent construction of a wind farm near his Scottish golf course  And Trump seems deranged and irrational on so many issues that one more bizarre claim hardly seems to matter But there s more to this than just another Trumpism  After all  we normally think of Republicans in general  and Trump in particular  as people who minimize or deny the  negative externalities  imposed by some business activities   the uncompensated costs they impose on other people or businesses For example  the Trump administration wants to roll back rules that limit emissions of mercury from power plants  And in pursuit of that goal  it wants to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from taking account of many of the benefits from reduced mercury emissions  such as an associated reduction in nitrogen oxide But when it comes to renewable energy  Trump and company are suddenly very worried about supposed negative side effects  which generally exist only in their imagination  Last year the administration floated a proposal that would have forced the operators of electricity grids to subsidize coal and nuclear energy  The supposed rationale was that new sources were threatening to destabilize those grids   but the grid operators themselves denied that this was the case So it s deregulation for some  but dire warnings about imaginary threats for others  What s going on Part of the answer is  follow the money  Political contributions from the meat processing industry overwhelmingly favor Republicans  Coal mining supports the G O P  almost exclusively  Alternative energy  on the other hand  generally favors Democrats There are probably other things  too  If you re a party that wishes we could go back to the 1950s  but without the 91 percent top tax rate   you re going to have a hard time accepting the reality that hippie dippy  unmanly things like wind and solar power are becoming ever more cost competitive Whatever the drivers of Trump policy  the fact  as I said  is that it will kill people  Wind turbines don t cause cancer  but coal burning power plants do   along with many other ailments  The Trump administration s own estimates indicate that its relaxation of coal pollution rules will kill more than 1 000 Americans every year  If the administration gets to implement its full agenda   not just deregulation of many industries  but discrimination against industries it doesn t like  such as renewable energy   the toll will be much higher So if you eat meat   or  for that matter  drink water or breathe air   there s a real sense in which Donald Trump is trying to kill you  And even if he s turned out of office next year  for many Americans it will be too late The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear

WASHINGTON   As she heads out the door  departing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will confront the odd dynamics of the post Trump job market Sure  opportunities await   but also perhaps some closed doors Outgoing top administration officials typically have a wide array of options in both the public and private sector   including speaking engagements  TV contracts  book deals  academic posts and corporate gigs  But some former Trump aides have found their options more limited than did their predecessors  in part due to controversy surrounding President Donald Trump s policies on issues such as the environment and immigration  as well as his record of racially charged language Nielsen  who resigned Sunday  has a resume offering expertise in managing a massive cabinet agency  But she also may face scrutiny as the public face of the administration s family separation policy  It s a totally different environment than a normal cabinet secretary leaving a normal administration  especially with her overseeing a lot of very controversial policies that have upset a lot of people   said Matt Lattimer  who served under President George W  Bush and is co founder of the Javelin literary agency   She s going to have to answer questions about those policies  Already  some critics are pushing to prevent Nielsen from cashing in on her tenure in the Trump administration  A collection of advocacy groups has written an open letter to executives  calling on corporate America to block any administration officials associated with family separations  including Nielsen  The letter was signed by the National Immigration Law Center  Southern Poverty Law Center  NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice and others  This is about making sure these administration officials  as they enter the revolving door of our government to private life  that they are not allowed to profit from the misery they inflicted on thousands of families   said Karl Frisch  a spokesman for Restore Public Justice  which is organizing the effort Frisch said the group was also readying a digital ad buy targeting Nielsen Some speculated that Nielsen would be a strong candidate for consulting jobs with companies that get government contracts  particularly as long as Trump is in office  when her knowledge and insight will be marketable Plenty of former Trump aides have found reasonably soft landings  though there have been some bumps along the way A number of formers have signed up with speaking agencies  among them Trump s most recent chief of staff John Kelly  former Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Trump s original chief  Reince Priebus  Priebus also returned to his former law firm  while Spicer wrote a book and serves as a consultant to a Trump supporting PAC  Still  Spicer did not score a TV contributor deal after he left the West Wing in 2017  though he recently signed on as a contributor to the syndicated entertainment show  Extra  Also writing a book was Omarosa Manigault Newman  Top communications official Hope Hicks took on a similar role at the new Fox company and Dina Powell  deputy national security adviser  returned to Goldman Sachs But corporate America has proven more elusive  compared with aides to President Barack Obama  Press Secretary Jay Carney is at Amazon  senior adviser David Plouffe is at Uber and Press Secretary Josh Earnest is at United Airlines  Tom Ridge  the first Homeland Security secretary under President George W  Bush  has served on a slew of private and public boards  While Trump officials have found lucrative options  those corner offices have not come their way To be sure  many Trump aides do not have the years of experience typically associated with top White House officials  which may also affect their prospects  And given the rapid turnover in the administration  they often are not able to conduct a methodical job hunt before making an exit Nielsen s carefully worded resignation letter suggests she is unlikely to break with the White House as she returns to private life  A former official in the George W  Bush White House who previously ran her own consulting firm  she had little public profile before taking the job For now  she is working to wind down her role with the department before a Wednesday exit  and evaluating options for the future    Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report  

On Sunday evening  news broke that Kirstjen Nielsen was leaving her job as head of the Department of Homeland Security  The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted that according to people close to Nielsen  one reason she hung on as long as she did was because  she was aware how awful life would will be for her on the outside   given her role in defending Donald Trump s policies Let s make it so Nielsen did not create Trump s monstrous policy of separating migrant families  but she should be known forever as the person who carried it out  She put babies in cages  traumatized children for life  and then appears to have lied to Congress about what she had done  She did this evil work with either blithe incompetence or malicious sloppiness  failing to create a system to properly track kids who were ripped from their families  On Friday  the Trump administration said it could take up to two years to identify thousands of separated migrant children  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt   Now Trump is gearing up to do it again  According to NBC News  for months the president has  urged his administration to reinstate large scale separation of migrant families crossing the border   Nielsen reportedly resisted  citing court rulings and Trump s own 2018 executive order ending his administration s family separation policy  Trump s choice for acting homeland security secretary  Kevin McAleenan  apparently is more open to the idea Should this happen  Congress and some judges will try to intervene  But Trump is growing ever more lawless and autocratic   There is a near systematic purge happening at the nation s second largest national security agency   a senior administration official told CNN on Monday  speaking of D H S  The president is filling positions with acting officials  circumventing Senate confirmation  Some senior members of the administration  like Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  are flatly refusing to cooperate with congressional oversight  CNN reported that Trump told border agents to ignore judges when taking steps to keep migrants out  We should not assume that government institutions will restrain the president before he visits anguish and terror on thousands more of the world s most vulnerable children What happens to Nielsen now can serve as an example to other people in the administration as they decide whether to just follow orders  By this  I don t mean that people should scream at Nielsen in restaurants  Rather  those horrified by family separation should do whatever they can to deny Nielsen the sort of cushy corporate landing or prestigious academic appointment once customary for ex administration officials  The fact that she evidently didn t go as far as an erratic and out of control Trump wanted is immaterial  she should be a pariah for going as far as she did Coincidentally  the day before Nielsen resigned  a coalition of progressive groups signed on to a petition asking corporate America to blacklist senior people in the Trump administration  including Nielsen  who took part in crafting  enacting or defending family separation   Allowing her to seek refuge in a corporate corner office or a boardroom  university  speaking agency or elsewhere poses a significant reputational risk for those involved   said Karl Frisch  a spokesman for Restore Public Trust  the group organizing the campaign How much of a risk will depend on decent Trump hating Americans  The Resistance has been flagging recently  even if abhorrence of Trump s degenerate administration has not  Many people  having worked frantically to deliver the House to Democrats in the midterms  are exhausted  The crackup of the Women s March  and the resulting tensions between some black and Jewish activists  has been deeply dispiriting  The beginning of the Democratic presidential primary has reanimated old intra left animosities  And relentless outrage is hard to sustain  no matter how justified But with the possible return of family separation  the Resistance needs to regroup  and demanding a boycott of Trump officials tainted by baby snatching is a good place to begin  Such a boycott would take advantage of one of the central asymmetries in American life  Rural voters  who tend to be conservative  have disproportionate political power  it s why Trump  who lost the popular vote  is president in the first place  But cosmopolitan progressives have disproportionate economic and cultural power  which is why we have the faintly absurd phenomenon of woke capitalism  That power should be deployed to force the sort of accountability Nielsen reportedly fears  and to serve as a warning to others that the Trump stink never washes off On Monday   Henry Farrell  a professor at George Washington University  wrote that he will boycott any university or think tank that employs Nielsen  and refuse to be on panels with anyone from such an institution  He invited others to join him  It s a small start  but a start  Nielsen should not be permitted to launder her reputation through a fellowship at Harvard  like Corey Lewandowski or Sean Spicer did  She should not get to follow H R  McMaster to Stanford There are plenty of places that will hire a disgraced child torturer   private prisons  which often hold undocumented immigrants  are a big business  And Henry Kissinger s storied social life shows that America s elite is far from inhospitable to ghouls  But as the country hurtles into a dangerous new phase of unbound Trumpism  those who want to say no need to muster whatever leverage they can  including public shame and economic sanctions  Either the leaders of corporate America and academia want to be associated with terrorizing toddlers  or not More from Opinion on Kirstjen Nielsen s departure Opinion   Jamelle Bouie  Who Is Left to Say No to Trump April 8  2019Opinion  U S  Policies Toward

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks with China were going well and he would only accept a  great  deal as negotiators hammered out differences ahead of a meeting between Trump and China s vice premier later in the day China and the United States are in the middle of intense negotiations to end a months long trade war that has rattled global markets  Washington wants sweeping changes to China s economic and trade policies  while Beijing wants Trump to lift expensive sanctions on Chinese goods The White House has no plans to announce a date on Thursday for a trade summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping  senior administration officials said  though they would not rule out the possibility Talks are scheduled to go through Friday and possibly longer  If it s not a great deal  we re not doing it  But it s going very well  Top officials are here  And we re very well along on the deal  It s a very complex deal  It s a very big deal   Trump told reporters  It ll be a great deal for our farmers  Technology  intellectual property theft    everything is covered  There s not a thing that s not covered   he said Trump is slated to meet with China s top trade negotiator  Vice Premier Liu He  at 4 30 p m   2030 GMT  in the Oval Office The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported that Trump was expected to announce a date for a summit at that time  but a senior administration official told Reuters that was incorrect  The White House is not expected to announce a date for a meeting   the official said A second administration official was a bit more cautious about prospects for an announcement  saying   It s possible  but I think it s unlikely  Hopes that the talks were moving in a positive direction have cheered financial markets in recent weeks  But U S  stocks were mixed on Thursday as investors waited for more developments in the trade negotiations  with the Dow Jones industrial Average slightly higher  and the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slightly lower    N Trump has proven unpredictable in past White House meetings with Liu  openly challenging U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in late February over the use of the term  memorandum of understanding  in the talks After meetings in Beijing last week  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are holding talks in Washington with Liu and a Chinese delegation this week Liu  Lighthizer and Mnuchin declined to speak to reporters as the three entered USTR offices near the White House on Thursday morning The second Trump administration official said that progress was being made on some issues in the talks  but others remained sticking points  such as the removal of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods and issues related to enforcement of any agreements The United States is seeking reforms to Chinese practices that it says results in the theft of U S  intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology from U S  companies to Chinese firms Administration officials initially envisioned a summit between Trump and Xi potentially taking place in March  but some U S  lawmakers and lobbying groups have said recently they were told that the administration was now aiming for a deal in late April  DEADLINES SLIPWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has declined to give a deadline for a deal  saying last week that the talks are  not time dependent  and could be extended for weeks or even months longer While some reform pledges by Beijing are largely agreed  including an agreement to avoid currency manipulation  the two sides have not yet settled on an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China keeps its pledges  Another key unresolved issue is whether and when punitive U S  tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods would be removed As the talks reach their final stages  resolving these two issues will be critical in determining whether a deal can be reached  U S  Chamber of Commerce international affairs chief Myron Brilliant told reporters on Tuesday  China has been very clear  publicly and privately  that they would like to see all the tariffs removed   Brilliant said   The  Trump  administration has been equally clear that they want to keep some of the tariffs in place as a way to have leverage over China fulfilling its obligations under whatever final package is reached     Editing by Susan Thomas  

WASHINGTON   The decision to seek the extradition of Julian Assange marked a dramatic new approach to the founder of WikiLeaks by the U S  government  a shift that was signaled in the early days of the Trump administration President Barack Obama s Justice Department had extensive internal debates about whether to charge Assange amid concerns the case might not hold up in court and would be viewed as an attack on journalism by an administration already taking heat for leak prosecutions But senior Trump administration officials seemed to make clear early on that they held a different view  dialing up the rhetoric on the anti secrecy organization shortly after it made damaging disclosures about the CIA s cyberespionage tools  WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service   former CIA Director Mike Pompeo said in April 2017 in his first public speech as head of the agency  Assange and his ilk   Pompeo said  seek  personal self aggrandizement through the destruction of Western values  A week after the CIA director s speech  then Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the arrest of Assange was a priority  part of a broader Justice Department crackdown on leakers  We ve already begun to step up our efforts  and whenever a case can be made  we will seek to put some people in jail   he said Pompeo  now secretary of state  declined Friday to discuss the issue  citing the now active legal pursuit of Assange following his removal a day earlier by British authorities from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London The administration won t say why they decided now to charge Assange with a single count of computer intrusion conspiracy that dates to 2010  Back then  WikiLeaks is alleged to have helped Chelsea Manning  then a U S  Army intelligence analyst  crack a password that gave her higher level access to classified computer networks Nor will they say whether the Obama administration had the same evidence that forms the basis of the indictment  or whether Assange will face additional counts if he is extradited to the United States But a U S  official  speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal and legal matters  traced the genesis of the indictment to what s known as the  Vault 7 leak  in 2017  when WikiLeaks released thousands of pages of documents revealing details about CIA tools for breaking into targeted computers  cellphones and consumer electronics A former CIA software engineer was charged with violating the Espionage Act by providing the information to WikiLeaks and is to go on trial later this year in New York  And the leak was a tipping point in deciding to pursue Assange  the official said  Vault 7 was the nail in the coffin  so to speak   the official said It ended years of ambivalence about what to do about Assange  who was hailed by many when WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of State Department cables and U S  military documents  including many that revealed previously unknown facts about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the detainees held at the U S  base at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba Even today  Assange and WikiLeaks have supporters around the world  amid a debate over whether the dissemination of raw  unfiltered documents and data counts as journalism Daniel Ellsberg  the former military analyst behind the famed leak of the secret history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers  called the charging of Assange an  ominous  effort to criminalize a necessary component of journalism  The charges are based on facts that were known throughout the Obama administration  which chose not to indict because of the obvious challenge to the First Amendment that would involve   Ellsberg said in an Associated Press interview A former Justice Department official  who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions  said there was an extensive debate within the government over the feasibility of charging Assange with the publication of stolen  classified materials But prosecutors grew concerned that such a case would not hold up in court  Even though officials did not agree with Assange s self characterization as a journalist  the former official said  there was concern that it would be hard to justify charging him with actions that more conventional journalists take The former official said the department at the time was more amenable to bringing a case like the one ultimately brought   a narrower prosecution centered on a hacking conspiracy  It focuses on an entirely different violation that may obviate any First Amendment or press freedom concern  This is just charging a journalist with conspiracy to hack into computer systems  which is no different than breaking into a building or breaking into a classified safe   said Mary McCord  a senior Justice Department national security official in the Obama administration   And that s not First Amendment protected activity  That is a widely held view in government  even among people generally sympathetic to the mission of the media  This was deliberate and malicious effort to cause harm to us  to U S  national security interests  and I think it would be good if there is some accountability at last   said David Pearce  who was U S  ambassador to Algeria in 2010 when WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables   So far there hasn t been any accountability for Mr  Assange       Associated Press writers Susannah George  Matthew Lee and Ned Barker contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   A bipartisan group of U S  senators introduced legislation on Wednesday mandating that the executive branch disclose details about authorizations it gives companies on sharing sensitive nuclear energy information with countries looking to build reactors  Lawmakers have criticized the Trump administration for issuing seven so called Part 810 authorizations to companies on sharing nuclear power information with Saudi Arabia and withholding information about them  They want to ensure the kingdom eventually agrees to strong nuclear power safeguards on uranium enrichment and reprocessing to avoid the risk of an arms race in the Middle East  Several lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives have asked the administration for details on the authorizations  but were told that even the names of companies that got them are proprietary  Previous 810 authorizations were made available to the public at the Department of Energy headquarters  Congress cannot play its oversight role and ensure U S  civil nuclear cooperation efforts do not encourage the spread of nuclear weapons making capabilities  when presidential administrations withhold information from lawmakers  Senator Marco Rubio said  Rubio and fellow Republican Senator Todd Young introduced the bill with Democratic Senators Tim Kaine and Edward Markey  A similar bill is expected in the House  The Trump administration has had talks with Saudi Arabia  which has been resistant to safeguards in a civilian nuclear cooperation pact known as a 123 agreement  which is subject to congressional approval  Such a deal would have to be signed before the transfer of materials to build reactors  The administration has also been trying to convince Riyadh to agree to safeguards in a so called Additional Protocol from the International Atomic Energy Agency  Markey asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a hearing to commit to sharing the 810 applications and authorizations  Pompeo said he would take the request under consideration but that other agencies have a voice in the authorizations  signed by Energy Secretary Rick Perry  Saudi Arabia says its plans are peaceful  But Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the kingdom would develop nuclear arms if its rival Iran did Riyadh plans to issue a multi billion dollar tender in 2020 to build its first two nuclear power reactors  sources said this month  Originally expected last year  the tender has been delayed several times  The United States  South Korea  Russia  China and France are competing for the business  U S  reactor builder Westinghouse  owned by Brookfield Asset Management Inc  would likely sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in any deal that involved U S  technology The bill  which faces an uncertain future in a tight congressional schedule  would amend the 1954 Atomic Energy Act to require the Department of Energy to turn over to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee reports on all 810 applications it receives and the authorizations it makes and denies  The chairs and ranking members of those committees could also ask the Energy Department for records on any 810 applications that are approved or pending  and the department would have 10 days to do so    Reporting by Timothy Gardner  Editing by Bill Berkrot and Leslie Adler  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration announced on Friday its latest round of economic sanctions against the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela  this time aimed at oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba  a country that the administration has accused of propping up Mr  Maduro s authoritarian government In a speech to the Venezuelan exile community in Houston  Vice President Mike Pence announced that the United States is levying sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Petróleos de Venezuela  S A   Venezuela s state run oil company  as well as on two international companies that transport Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba  Venezuela s oil belongs to the Venezuelan people   said Mr  Pence  who is expected to address the United Nations Security Council next week on the situation in Venezuela The goal of the sanctions  senior administration officials said  was to force a  recalibration  of the relationship between Venezuela and Cuba  which  alongside China and Russia  has been defending the Maduro government But in the short run  they are meant to end the arrangement by which the Maduro government provides oil to Cuba in exchange for intelligence and counterintelligence services while the Venezuelan people lack food  medicine and clean water  Venezuela has been shipping 20 000 to 50 000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba  according to experts in the oil industry and administration officials Russ Dallen  the managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets  who specializes in the Venezuelan oil industry  said the most likely outcome of the sanctions would be to create an atmosphere in which shipping companies would be even more wary of doing business with either Cuba or Venezuela  for fear of triggering sanctions He said they were also meant to  name and shame  companies that have transported Venezuelan oil to Cuba so that Mr  Maduro can help an ideological ally rather than use profits from the oil to feed a starving population  It makes Cuba and Venezuela even more radioactive   he said Mr  Dallen  who tracks oil shipments leaving Venezuela  said that some of the ships had begun turning off their transponders when in Venezuelan ports  something regulations prohibit but is a technique used in countries like Iran to conceal their presence in the country  One ship  Mr  Dallen said  had recently left its transponder off until it reached Europe The sanctions come as Venezuela has faced a month of blackouts that have resulted in an estimated loss of a week s oil production President Trump has thrown his support behind Juan Guaidó  the Venezuelan opposition leader  who in January declared himself the country s interim president and who has demanded Mr  Maduro s departure  Venezuela s economy and population have slipped further into crisis   with blackouts  as well as food and water shortages   while Mr  Maduro and Mr  Guaidó appear to be trying to wait each other out A senior administration official said on Friday that the latest round of sanctions would  tighten the noose of the financial strangulation of Maduro and his cronies   Those sanctions come weeks after the Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on a Russia based bank that it accused of helping Mr  Maduro s government sidestep American financial penalties But it has been more than two months since the Trump administration began imposing sanctions in Venezuela in hopes of pushing Mr  Maduro s government out of power  But to people living in Caracas  the capital  it is not clear that his grip on power is loosening  despite the American effort to target governors  generals and the state run oil company and to cancel visas for Mr  Maduro s friends and family members The American official said that there would be more actions by the United States in the coming weeks and that a military response continued to be a  very serious option   The official hinted that a red line for American intervention would be any threat to arrest Mr  Guaidó  

ADDIS ABABA  Ethiopia   Just two minutes after takeoff  the captain of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 said the plane was having problems  Pilots then began having trouble controlling the aircraft In the plane s short and fatal flight  pilots initially followed safety procedures recommended by Boeing  performing actions on the emergency checklist  including cutting off electricity to an automatic system that was pushing the nose down  But they were still unable to prevent the jet from crashing  according to an initial report by Ethiopian investigators About six minutes after takeoff  the plane went into a fatal dive that killed all 157 people on board The report  released Thursday  laid out a timeline of the flight based on analysis from 18 Ethiopian and international investigators and information from the jet s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder  The investigators  initial report was released several hours after a news conference held by Ethiopia s minister of transportation The data showed that shortly after liftoff  a crucial sensor that measures the angle that the plane is moving through the air  began fluctuating wildly on the pilot s side  falsely indicating that the plane was close to stalling  The sensor  one of two sensors on the plane s nose  began giving readings nearly 60 degrees different from that of its counterpart About a minute and a half after takeoff  after the pilots had performed routine tasks like retracting flaps on the wings  the false reading appears to have set off an automated system known as MCAS  the black box data shows  MCAS is intended to prevent a stall and began rapidly pushing the nose of the craft down A Faulty SensorMoments after takeoff  one of two crucial sensors that measure the plane s angle of attack diverged wildly  eventually triggering an automated system that pushed down the nose of the plane        g ethiopia aoa box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g ethiopia aoa box  g artboard

angle of stabilizers on the tail of the plane  which had been moved by MCAS  About five seconds after the pilots tried the right the plane  MCAS again engaged  moving the stabilizers to a dangerous angle in another nose down action The pilots pushed the electrical switches again  Then  the report says  they followed the emergency checklist and disabled the entire stabilizer electrical system using the so called stabilizer trim cutout  The first officer called out  stab trim cutout  two times   the report says   Captain agreed and first officer confirmed stab trim cutout  Although that move disabled MCAS  it also forced the crew to control the stabilizers manually with wheels at their feet   a physically difficult task on a plane moving at high speed  A little under four minutes after takeoff  the first officer said the manual method  is not working  Soon after  the black box data indicates  the crew turned electricity back on and tried two more times to move the stabilizers by hitting the switches  But once they turned the electricity back on  MCAS engaged again  putting the plane into a dive from which it would not recover The crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10 followed the unrecoverable nose dive almost five months earlier of another jet of the same model  a Boeing 737 Max 8  in Indonesia  Indonesian investigators have implicated MCAS in that disaster  in which the plane s computer system appeared to override pilot directions based on faulty data  Here s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes  and what Boeing has been doing since   These guys are executing the checklist   Dennis Tajer  a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union  said of the Ethiopian pilots after reviewing the report   They were identifying the problem and taking swift action  The initial findings are likely to heighten scrutiny of the Max  Boeing s newest and top selling generation of jets  Since the Ethiopian Airlines crash  airlines worldwide have grounded their Max fleets  amid concerns over the apparent propensity of MCAS to malfunction when fed erroneous data The preliminary report was the first official investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines flight  and it echoed some initial suspicions about the crash Boeing 737 Max  What s Happened After the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air CrashesBoeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months Ethiopian authorities portrayed the pilots of the plane in a positive light  Dagmawit Moges  Ethiopia s minister of transportation  said that the flight crew repeatedly followed procedures recommended by the plane s manufacturer  but was not able to control the aircraft  The Dangerous Flaws in Boeing s Automated SystemHere s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months Both 737 Max 8 jets crashed at high speed minutes after takeoff in clear weather  following roller coaster trajectories that hinted at desperate struggles by pilots to control planes seemingly immune to their interventions In a statement on Thursday  Boeing s chief executive  Dennis A  Muilenburg  said that the company was  confident in the fundamental safety of the 737 Max   Boeing has said it plans to release a software update to MCAS soon  along with increased pilot training for the 737 Max planes  This update  along with the associated training and additional educational materials that pilots want in the wake of these accidents  will eliminate the possibility of unintended MCAS activation and prevent an MCAS related accident from ever happening again   Mr  Muilenburg said After the report from Ethiopia was released  Boeing said it was working  to ensure unintended MCAS activation will not occur again   Boeing has developed and is planning to release a software update to MCAS and an associated comprehensive pilot training and supplementary education program for the 737 Max   the company said in a statement Investigations into both crashes are continuing  A final report on the Lion Air accident is expected in August  at the earliest  Ethiopian officials said on Thursday that their final findings could take a year to be released Indonesian investigators have focused on whether the anti stall system was activated by incorrect data on the plane s angle of attack  essentially a measure of an aircraft s likelihood of stalling After the Lion Air crash last October  pilots and airlines complained that they had not been adequately briefed on MCAS by Boeing  The Max manual had no specific mention of how to correct a malfunctioning MCAS  Some pilots reported that they had not even known of the software s existence In 12 Minutes  Everything Went WrongHow the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control In creating the Max jet  Boeing added bigger engines to the 737  which gave the airplane the fuel efficiency it needed to compete with a new model from its rival  Airbus  But the change also altered the jet s aerodynamics and the larger engines had a tendency to push the airplane s nose up in certain flight conditions To compensate  Boeing engineers created MCAS  which was meant to make the Max behave more like older versions of the 737  To receive certification to fly the Max  some pilots with prior 737 experience had to complete only a couple hours of online training Boeing has said that existing procedures were sufficient to address a MCAS malfunction  but early data suggests that pilots on the doomed flights may not have known how to disengage the system  or may have done so too late to save their flights Most airplane systems are built with backup redundancies to prevent a single data malfunction from altering a plane s course  but MCAS is activated by data from just one angle of attack sensor  not two The Federal Aviation Administration released a statement saying it was still working with Ethiopian officials to investigate the crash   As we learn more about the accident and findings become available  we will take appropriate action   the F A A  said In the news conference  Ms  Moges  the transport minister  cautioned against holding any party responsible for the plane s fatal plunge  The major objective of this investigation is to make sure that there is safety in the aviation sector   she said   It is not to blame someone   

President Trump on Friday announced a new wireless spectrum auction intended to speed the rollout of the next generation of wireless communications networks  a technology the administration views as critical to winning an economic war with China Yet Mr  Trump has so far remained silent on whether the United States would issue an order essentially banning Chinese firms like Huawei from building those networks At the White House on Friday  Ajit Pai  the Federal Communications Commission chairman  announced the third  and largest  auction of spectrum that telecom companies will use to build  fifth generation   or 5G  networks  which promise a major speed increase for downloading data over cellular networks Rolling out those networks  in both cities and rural areas  requires essentially rebuilding the nation s cell networks and switching systems  Over time  the evolution to the new architecture promises to transform how billions of  internet of things  devices   such as autonomous cars and industrial sensors   operate  allowing faster  seamless connectivity The Trump administration sees this next generation of technology as critical to the United States  ability to dominate industries of the future and power its long term economic prospects  It views China s ability to control these networks as a national security threat because it could  at least theoretically  give Beijing access to the information that flows across them  Secure 5G networks will absolutely be a vital link to America s prosperity and national security in the 21st century   Mr  Trump said on Friday But Chinese telecommunications companies  like Huawei  are poised to dominate because they offer the most inexpensive  and what some European and Asian officials consider some of the best  equipment to provide the technical backbone of 5G networks  There are no American suppliers for the main switching networks  meaning that the American systems will largely be built by firms like Nokia and Ericsson  both European The administration has long been contemplating an executive order that would ban American telecom companies from using Huawei or other Chinese equipment when building 5G networks  But that executive order has not materialized  leading many officials and industry executives to believe the administration is holding back until the current trade negotiations with China are completed  Any move to bar Chinese firms from the United States could anger Chinese leadership It is possible that Mr  Trump will allow some Chinese access to the American market   despite national security concerns   in order to strike a trade deal with Xi Jinping  China s president Even without the ban  the Trump administration has taken a hard line with allies  telling them that allowing Huawei to build and maintain 5G systems  even if they are operated by Western companies  could give Beijing an undetectable backdoor into wireless networks The fear is that the Chinese government will be able to suck up and copy data flowing over wireless networks  potentially compromising that information and  theoretically  putting trade secrets and military intelligence at risk  While much of that data is encrypted  giving Chinese firms control over the flow of data is considered a major risk by the Pentagon and intelligence agencies But to Mr  Trump  5G is an election issue as much as a security issue  Speaking at the White House  surrounded by wireless company workers wearing cowboy hats and hard hats  Mr  Trump said the United States could not allow itself to be  outcompeted  in 5G networks  The race to 5G is a race America must win   Mr  Trump said   And it is a race frankly that our great companies are now involved in  We have given them the incentive they need  It is a race we will win  The Trump administration had considered a plan that would have created national 5G networks using federal money  Mr  Trump said on Friday that that approach had been rejected and that private industry would build out the American 5G networks Mr  Trump made no mention of China or any Chinese companies like Huawei  though he did say 5G networks must be  guarded from the enemy   and we do have enemies out there  Mr  Trump also repeatedly said he would extend broadband access to rural America   No matter where you are you will have access very quickly to 5G  and it will be a different life   Mr  Trump said But critics of the administration s approach said the technology the United States had embraced focused too much on the high band spectrum  which will make it more difficult to deliver 5G service in rural America Jessica Rosenworcel  a Democratic appointee to the F C C   criticized the Trump administration s 5G policy  saying it had done  more harm than good   From imposing tariffs on 5G equipment to alienating allies on 5G security to falling behind the rest of the world on critical mid band spectrum  it has yet to offer a workable plan for US leadership   she said on Twitter The United States has auctioned other parts of the high band electromagnetic spectrum to firms that need to communicate to a new generation of cellphones and internet of things devices Some experts think the United States should focus more on developing midband  not high band  spectrum  High band allows more data  but has a much smaller range  meaning providers must build far more 5G towers  It also means a 5G system based on high band spectrum is harder to build in rural areas Other parts of the world  especially in Asia  have focused their 5G development on midband spectrum  which covers a broader area although with less capacity  It s essential that we pivot to midband right now because the rest of the world could leave us behind   Ms  Rosenworcel said in an interview   This is the spectrum that is most likely to bring 5G service to rural parts of this country  and we need to think about investing in this now and not later   

WASHINGTON   The head of the U S  Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday the agency would revise its proposed freeze of vehicle fuel economy standards before unveiling its final regulation in the coming months In August  the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  proposed freezing requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026 but EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview at the agency s headquarters  our final regulation is not going to be the same as our proposal   We ve taken constructive comments  criticisms  concerns from a whole host of different interest groups   Wheeler said   I hope our final regulation is something that everybody can get behind and support  Two U S  officials briefed on the matter said they expected the EPA to wind up requiring a small increase in the yearly fuel efficiency gains  likely around mid June  but said the precise figure had not been finalized  It is also not clear what flexibilities will remain in the final rule Obama era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46 7 miles per gallon by 2026  with average annual increases of nearly 5 percent  compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration s preferred option The administration s proposed changes would also strip California of the ability to impose its own state emissions standards or require a rising number of electric vehicles The proposed fuel efficiency freeze would hike U S  oil consumption by about 500 000 barrels per day by the 2030s  according to administration officials  Wheeler denied the rules were written at the behest of oil industry lobbyists  This has nothing to do with the oil industry  We re not doing this for the oil industry  I m not doing this for the oil industry   Wheeler said The Trump administration said in August that the freeze would save automakers more than  300 billion in regulatory costs and reduce the projected cost of a new vehicle by  1 850  It also said the measure would save lives because Americans would more quickly buy newer safer vehicles  a claim disputed by California and environmental groups Automakers like General Motors Co  Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp oppose a freeze but want requirements reduced to account for changes in oil prices and consumer demand  All have pushed for a compromise deal to head off years of legal uncertainty  The White House in February ended talks with California to try to reach a deal  Reuters reported in March the White House had held meetings with automakers to push them to back it in its fight with California  California last week sued the EPA over its failure to provide data used to justify easing vehicle efficiency standards   California and 16 other states had previously vowed to challenge any emissions rollback Wheeler heaped scorn on California   This is so much more about politics for the state of California than it is protecting the environment   Wheeler said California s top air regulator Mary Nichols said in February the proposal flies  in the face of science  logic and any effort to protect public health    Reporting by David Shepardson  Tim Gardner  mValerie olcovici and Humeyra Pamuk  Editing by Tom Brown

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Friday that his administration was  strongly  considering releasing migrants detained at the border into mostly Democratic  sanctuary cities   suggesting that the idea should make liberals  very happy  because of their immigration policies Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws  we are indeed  as reported  giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only      Donald J  Trump   realDonaldTrump  April 12  2019     The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders  Open Arms policy   so this should make them very happy   Donald J  Trump   realDonaldTrump  April 12  2019  We are looking at the possibility  strongly looking at it to be honest with you   he said on Friday in response to a question about the proposal  We might as well do what they always say they want   Mr  Trump said if Democrats do not agree to new immigration policies   We ll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it   he said  adding that California welcomed the idea of more people coming to the state  We can give them a lot  We can give them an unlimited supply   he said VideoPresident Trump said that his administration was  strongly  considering sending migrants to so called sanctuary cities   Let s see if they have open arms   he said CreditCreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThe comments came a day after the administration said the policy proposal was never seriously considered  But after the president s Twitter posts on Friday  a White House spokesman said Democrats should work with the administration to welcome migrants into their districts  Democrats say we must have open borders and that illegal immigrants have a right to be in this country at all costs   the spokesman  Hogan Gidley  said  adding   so they should be working with the administration to find the best ways to transport those illegal aliens that are already set for release  into communities in their districts and states  Democratic lawmakers do not want  open borders   as the president has suggested  They favor improving border security  but they do not support many of Mr  Trump s hard line immigration policy proposals  such as building a wall along the southwestern border Last year  Trump administration officials had floated the idea of transporting migrants to sanctuary cities  which do not strictly adhere to federal immigration laws  as a way to address the influx of migrants crossing the border with Mexico One of the highest profile sanctuary cities is San Francisco  home to Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who is one of the president s top political rivals and a thorn in his efforts to change American immigration laws  The White House raised the proposal again in February  suggesting it could punish Democrats for rejecting budget requests for border security Ms  Pelosi s office condemned the Trump administration for the idea  which the Department of Homeland Security said on Thursday was ultimately rejected But Mr  Trump s tweets on Friday indicated it was not off the table  and the president appeared to revel in the Democratic outrage  saying   The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders  Open Arms policy   so this should make them very happy  Senator Edward J  Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  a state with several sanctuary cities  criticized the president s proposal  Trump s plan to release migrants into  enemy  cities as if they are some kind of contagion is reprehensible   Mr  Markey tweeted   Trump is obsessed with the border and sanctuary cities because he only wins by dividing people  There has been an influx of migrant families crossing the southern border into the United States  exceeding the staffing and resources available for immigration enforcement  And with a shortage of space in shelters and detention centers  immigration officials have been releasing migrants into the country as they wait to appear before an immigration court  Those courts are so backlogged with cases that it can be months or years before the migrants are called to appear before a judge A top immigration official at the Department of Homeland Security pushed back last year against the proposal to release migrants into sanctuary cities  and said it would create  an unnecessary operational burden  on Immigration and Customs Enforcement Currently  these migrants are released into border towns  Transporting them to sanctuary cities  which are scattered across the country   with some as far away as Massachusetts and Vermont   would come at a great expense Typically  reallocating homeland security funds intended for a specific purpose would require approval from House and Senate appropriators Some immigration advocates saw Mr  Trump s proposal as an attempt to stoke racial tensions across the country George Gascón  the district attorney for San Francisco  said the proposal was  the clearest sign yet that the president fully intends to chart a path to re election on the back of racist rhetoric and policies intended to divide us  Janet Murguía  the president of UnidosUS  formerly the National Council of La Raza  called the proposal  reprehensible   It seems that not only is President Trump attempting to utilize human beings  who have already experienced a traumatic situation  as tools to get back at political foes  but as a vehicle to further divide communities by stoking racial tensions   she said in a statement  

SAN FRANCISCO   A U S  judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration s policy of returning asylum seekers to Mexico as they wait for a court to hear their cases  but the order won t immediately go into effect Judge Richard Seeborg on Monday granted a request by civil liberties groups to halt the practice while their lawsuit moves forward  The decision is on hold until Friday to give U S  officials the chance to appeal The groups say the policy violates U S  law by failing to adequately evaluate the dangers that migrants face in Mexico President Donald Trump s administration says the policy responds to a crisis at the southern border that has overwhelmed the ability of immigration officials to detain migrants The launch of the practice in January marked an unprecedented change to the U S  asylum system  

WASHINGTON   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo left open the possibility on Wednesday of entering a conflict with Iran without first seeking explicit congressional approval  telling senators  there is no doubt there is a connection  between Al Qaeda and Iran His comments came two days after the Trump administration designated Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist group  and were likely to fuel concerns of American military action against the country Senator Rand Paul  Republican of Kentucky  pushed Mr  Pompeo to commit that the Trump administration would not attack Iran under a war authorization allowing the use of military force against Al Qaeda and other extremist groups responsible for the terrorist attacks of Sept  11  2001 Mr  Pompeo demurred  saying he would  prefer to just leave that to lawyers  Mr  Paul  a libertarian who promotes isolationist policies  said he was troubled by Mr  Pompeo s response   I can tell you explicitly  you have not been given power or authority by Congress to have war with Iran   he said in the exchange at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Mr  Pompeo pivoted  noting ties between Iran and Al Qaeda   There is no doubt there is a connection  Period  Full stop  After the Sept  11 attacks  and as American forces prepared to bomb Afghanistan  more than a dozen senior Qaeda members fled to Iran  The circumstances of their living conditions were murky  but at least some were detained and later traded  in a prisoner swap with a Qaeda branch in Yemen  Hamza bin Laden  a son of Osama bin Laden  was believed to be among those living in Iran after the 2001 attacks  he is now considered a rising Qaeda leader Over several administrations  American officials have interpreted and stretched the 2001 authorization for use of force against the perpetrators of the Sept  11 terrorist attacks as granting legal permission to wage an armed conflict against not just Al Qaeda and the Taliban  but also other Sunni Islamist groups with links to Al Qaeda in the Middle East and North Africa It is not clear how the Trump administration could plausibly say Iran is an ally of Al Qaeda and participated in the Sept  11 attacks  Among other things  Al Qaeda and its affiliates are Sunni extremists who consider adherents of the Shiite branch of Islam  like Iran s government  to be heretics Mr  Pompeo has been a ringleader in the Trump administration s pressure campaign against Iran  The terrorist designation that he announced on Monday was the first by the United States against an official entity in another country s government It also appeared to pique Mr  Paul s questioning about whether the United States was outlining a foundation for war  Mr  Pompeo called the designation against the Iranian military unit a  recognition of reality  Additionally  Mr  Pompeo was asked to affirm support for a two state solution in the Israeli Palestinian conflict  as have previous Republican and Democratic administrations  He declined to answer when asked to describe what the United States would do if the Israeli government tried to annex the West Bank  widely seen as the foundation for a Palestinian state  The old set of ideas aren t worth retreading   he said in a reiteration of answers he gave at a Senate hearing on Tuesday   They have simply not succeeded  Pressed by Senator Tim Kaine  Democrat of Virginia  on whether a two state solution was an  old idea   Mr  Pompeo replied   I would argue that millions of man hours have been spent to try to build out a two state solution  It hasn t worked to date  it may work this afternoon  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  who appeared to win a fifth term Tuesday  said last weekend that he would apply sovereignty to some or all of the West Bank if re elected  A framework for peace negotiations is likely to be unveiled soon by Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law and Middle East adviser  although it is not expected to insist on a two state solution or on ceding sovereignty to the Palestinians Mr  Pompeo said the peace framework would contain  things that neither of them like   referring to Israeli and Palestinian leaders   but things that the Gulf States think make sense  Mr  Kushner has sought approval for his plan from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia  but the kingdom has been critical of Mr  Trump s decision in 2017 to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem  

A federal court settlement announced on Friday would allow almost 2 700 children living in Central America to safely reunite with their parents  who are living in the United States under protected status The settlement between the families and the Trump administration affects children who had been conditionally approved by the government to join their parents before the White House canceled the Central American Minors program in August 2017 The program began under the Obama administration in 2014  It allowed the children of parents who are lawfully in the United States to apply for permanent residency as refugees  Many of those parents hold temporary protected status  which allows migrants from countries that have experienced natural disasters  longstanding unrest or conflict to remain in the United States Without the program  children from El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras would have had to travel through dangerous conditions to reach the United States border and apply for refugee status  When you re a refugee  you typically have to come to the U S  border to request protection via our asylum system   said Justin Cox  a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project  which helped represent the families  The Central American Minors program was designed as a workaround to reunite children with their parents  by allowing the kids to apply from their home countries Four families whose children had applied to the program and been conditionally approved filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after it was canceled  They were joined by CASA  a Maryland based immigration advocacy group The nearly 2 700 children covered by the settlement had been conditionally approved to join at least one of their parents in the United States  according to Mr  Cox Many were waiting for a medical check  a final step in the process  he said  when the Trump administration quietly stopped all processing shortly after coming into office  Seven months later  in August 2017  the White House officially announced the end of the program In December 2018  a judge for the United States District Court in San Francisco ruled that the government s revocation of the conditional approvals for the child applicants was against the law  Last month  the same judge ordered the government to resume processing the children The government will now reverify the children s eligibility and start medical checks   It could take months   Mr  Cox said   but the expectation is that most  if not all  the kids should be able to come  In fact  the settlement with the government stipulates that most of the children are expected to be approved and allowed to travel to the United States Many parents whose children are covered by the settlement have had temporary protected status for several years  during which they have not seen their children Linda Evarts  who is also a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project  said   We are so pleased that after many years apart  our clients will finally have the opportunity to reunite with each other in safety   

 Reuters    The United States approved nearly 40 percent more oil and gas drilling permits on public lands in 2018 than it did the previous year thanks to an automated online system introduced in the waning days of the Obama administration  helping reduce a big backlog of applications President Donald Trump has made it a priority to speed permitting and reduce regulation as a way to boost production of oil  gas and coal from public lands   an agenda that has pleased the energy and mining industries but outraged environmentalists concerned about pollution and climate change The Department of Interior s Bureau of Land Management approved 3 991 drilling permits in fiscal 2018  up from 2 887 in 2017  the agency said  an increase of 38 percent  The average time to process an application to drill with BLM was cut nearly in half to 63 days from 120 days in 2017 A BLM spokesman  Derrick Henry  attributed the permit approval increase in 2018 to  using increased automation and flexible staffing to make decisions more quickly  The numbers were first revealed by Brian Steed  deputy director for policy and programs at BLM  in Congressional testimony earlier this month  BLM said the figures were not yet finalized and could still change BLM in 2017 set a goal of eliminating its backlog of permit applications that have been pending for three or more years by October of this year  and in the first nine months of 2018 slashed it by 47 percent from 551 to 288  according to a BLM document reviewed by Reuters  Under the Obama administration  BLM undertook a major effort to improve its system for processing permits to address long delays and inefficiency  In 2016 it shifted to all electronic filing  Permit approval times were around 200 days prior to the introduction of the new system  according to BLM data The Western Energy Alliance  an oil and gas industry trade group  said speedier permit approvals were due to both increased automation and a more supportive administration  The improvements in automation were started under President Obama  but having an administration which wants to move forward is even more important   said Kathleen Sgamma  WEA s president  Environmentalists say the increased speed has come at the expense of allowing the public to provide input on the drilling applications  which are posted publicly on the permitting web site for 30 days and then removed  BLM is cutting corners on environmental reviews of drilling permits by shutting out the public from commenting on those reviews   said Kelly Fuller  energy and mining campaigns director for Western Watersheds Project  The group argues that the 30 day posting falls short of the BLM s obligation to seek public input under federal environmental law   Reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles  Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington  Editing by Phil Berlowitz  

WASHINGTON   U S  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  who oversaw President Donald Trump s bitterly contested immigration policies during her tumultuous 16 month tenure  resigned on Sunday amid a surge in the number of migrants at the border with Mexico A senior administration official said Trump asked for Nielsen s resignation and she gave it  Trump  who has recently expressed growing anger about the situation at the border  said on Twitter   Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position  and I would like to thank her for her service  In another tweet  Trump said Kevin McAleenan  the current U S  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  would become acting DHS secretary In a tweet late Sunday  Nielsen said that she would stay on until Wednesday  I have agreed to stay on as Secretary through Wednesday  April 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are not impacted   she said Nielsen s departure was first reported by CBS News  Nielsen  46  had been DHS secretary since December 2017  Her departure had been repeatedly rumored over the past year  particularly after a wave of anger over the administration s 2018 family separation policy at the border with Mexico and most recently as U S  border officials estimated that 100 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in March  the highest level in a decade Another senior administration official said Trump s national security adviser  John Bolton  after a blowup with Nielsen late last year  also recommended to Trump that she should go Trump has made a clampdown on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his two year old presidency  leading chants of  Build that wall  at his rallies as he has sought to cut back on the number of newcomers entering the United States without proper documentation Many of the migrants picked up last month were Central Americans seeking U S  asylum Trump was so frustrated about the increase that he announced he would cut off U S  aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  He also threatened to close the border with Mexico  although he later backed off that proposal with a threat to impose tariffs on auto imports In her resignation letter  Nielsen asked for more from Congress and the courts  which have opposed such Trump administration initiatives as his effort to limit immigration from Muslim nations and the border wall  I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse   she wrote to Trump Trump also took aim at Congress in another tweet later on Sunday  saying   Country is FULL   and saying Democrats in Congress must  fix loopholes  and repeating his threats to close the border or impose tariffs if Mexico does not do more  Nielsen s resignation was the latest high profile departure from the Trump administration  and leaves just four women in his Cabinet  Among others  Trump currently lacks a permanent secretary of defense or chief of staff LIGHTNING RODNielsen s departure was announced two days after the Republican president abruptly said on Friday he was dumping his nominee to be the top official at U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE   Ronald Vitiello  saying he wanted someone  tougher  ICE is under the jurisdiction of DHS  which was formed following the Sept  11  2001  attacks on New York and Washington Repeatedly subjected to tough questioning by Democrats at congressional hearings  Nielsen became a lightning rod for criticism of Trump s policies  She was confronted by protesters last year at a Mexican restaurant in Washington Last year  Nielsen came under increasing pressure by critics to step aside after the Trump administration adopted the policy of separating migrant children from their parents as part of its  zero tolerance  approach intended to deter families from leaving home in the hope of entering the United States After criticism as pictures of children in cages were spread across the world  Trump signed an executive order in June ending family separations and requiring that families be held together in federal custody while the adults awaited prosecution for illegally crossing the border But the government reported that at least 245 children were taken from their families between that time and the first months of 2019 Trump insists that the arrival of immigrants across the southern U S  border constitutes a national emergency so important that he sidestepped Congress  refusal to provide him with billions of dollars he requested to build the border wall Representative Bennie Thompson  the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee  said Nielsen s tenure at DHS  was a disaster from the start  He said in a statement  however  that she should not serve as a scapegoat  blasting Trump for  terrible and cruel policies   Noting that the department now has neither a permanent secretary nor deputy secretary  Thompson called on the administration to work with Congress  in good faith  Before she was nominated as secretary  Nielsen worked as a deputy to former Marine General John Kelly  who headed DHS before becoming White House chief of staff  Kelly resigned as chief of staff on Jan  2

 Reuters    The Trump administration has agreed to allow approximately 2 700 children living in Central America to be reunited with their parents in the United States under a court settlement announced on Friday  according to court documents The settlement follows a lawsuit that challenged a decision in 2017 by President Donald Trump s administration to shut down a programme that allowed children living in Central America to be reunited with parents residing legally in the United States The Central American Minors programme  which began in 2014  allowed parents living legally in the United States to request refugee status for their children residing in Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras Many of the parents are in the United States under the so called temporary protected status  which allows immigrants from countries that have suffered natural disasters  civil conflicts or other problems to stay in the United States  Last month  U S  Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco ordered the government to resume processing children who had been conditionally approved for the programme when it was terminated by the Trump administration The settlement  which must be approved by a judge  requires the government to finish processing children who were in the final stages of their applications when the programme was ended  the International Refugee Assistance Project  IRAP   which represented the plaintiffs  said in a statement It said the government anticipates most applicants will be approved and allowed to travel to the United States  We are so pleased that after many years apart our clients will finally have the opportunity to reunite with each other in safety   IRAP attorney Linda Evarts said in the statement  These families belong together here in the United States  and we are hopeful this settlement will allow for their swift reunification   she said The U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services agency  which signed the settlement  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  nor did the U S  Justice Department   Reporting by Eric Beech and David Alexander in Washington  Editing by Sandra Maler  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration on Monday scrapped a historic agreement between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that would have allowed Cuban players to sign with U S  teams without needing to defect The existing deal will not be allowed to go forward because it was based on an erroneous ruling by the former Obama administration that the Cuban Baseball Federation was not part of Cuba s Communist government  a senior U S  official said The move essentially overturns an agreement reached between MLB and the Cuban federation in December after three years of negotiation under which Cuban players would have had a safe  legal path to playing professionally in the United States  In the past  some Cuban stars have undertaken risky escapes  including being smuggled off the island in speedboats The U S  decision was the latest step by President Donald Trump to roll back the rapprochement with Havana  America s old Cold War foe  that was spearheaded by his predecessor  Barack Obama  Trump has especially stepped up pressure on Cuba recently over its support for Venezuela s socialist president  Nicolas Maduro  The agreement with  MLB seeks to stop the trafficking of human beings  encourage cooperation and raise the level of baseball   the Cuban Baseball Federation said on Twitter   Any contrary idea is false news  Attacks with political motivation against the agreement achieved harm the athletes  their families and the fans  The senior Trump administration official suggested that the agreement would have subjected the players to  human trafficking  by the Cuban government  making them  pawns of the Cuba dictatorship  Carlos Tabares  a member of Cuba s 2004 Olympic gold medal winning squad who until last year played for a Havana team  said the Trump administration was seeking  to destroy us  even through baseball   The MLB deal  he said  would have allowed Cuban players  to enter legally rather than falling into the hands of traffickers and having to risk their lives  The U S  official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the administration would be willing to work with MLB to seek an arrangement consistent with U S  law  We are unsure of the next steps   an MLB source said The announcement came just days after the Cuban federation released its first list of 34 players authorized to sign contracts directly with major league teams  A PAYMENT TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT The U S  Treasury Department on Monday reversed the Obama era ruling that Cuba s league was not part of the Cuban government  which had laid the groundwork for the baseball deal The Trump administration considers the Cuban Baseball Federation to be part of the island s National Sports Institute  which  according to the U S  official  is a government entity that U S  law says makes such business dealings illegal  A payment to the Cuban Baseball Federation is a payment to the Cuban government   Treasury said in a letter to MLB Cuba maintains  however  that its baseball federation is not part of the state  It says the federation falls under the Cuban Olympic Committee  which in turn reports to the International Olympic Committee  not the Cuban government MLB teams would have paid the federation a release fee for each Cuban player signed  providing a windfall for Cuban baseball  which has suffered from dwindling budgets and the defection of its best players In the past  many Cuban players seeking riches in the big leagues have made dangerous journeys via human traffickers to defect  Others abandoned the Cuban national team while playing abroad Cuban MLB players who had defected include Yasiel Puig of the Cincinnati Reds  Yoenis Cespedes of the New York Mets and Jose Dariel Abreu of the Chicago White Sox   all of whom have signed multi year  multimillion dollar contracts Puig defected from Cuba on a speedboat at age 21 and soon found himself entangled with Mexico s notorious Zetas crime organization  which threatened to chop off his arm if it failed to receive the promised  250 000 fee for his passage When Puig finally reached U S  shores in 2012  he was rewarded with a seven year   42 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers Under the deal agreed by MLB and the Cuban federation in December  MLB teams were going to pay the federation a fee ranging from 15 percent to 25 percent of the value of player contracts That money  which was not to be deducted from the player s salary but be paid on top of it  would have been used to help Cuba further develop its baseball program Cuban players older than age 25 and with six years of service in the Cuban league would have been free to sign with MLB teams  Younger players would have needed Cuban baseball s permission to leave   Reporting by Matt Spetalnick  additional reporting by Dan Trotta in New York and Sarah Marsh in Havana  Editing by Bill Berkrot and Tom Brown  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump has ordered a shake up of the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security  the head of the U S  Secret Service said on Monday  after the White House said the official would be soon be leaving his post The Secret Service said Randolph  Tex  Alles would depart his job next month  The announcement came a day after Trump ousted Alles  boss  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  with whom he had clashed over immigration issues  No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my  firing   I assure you that this is not the case  and in fact was told weeks ago by the administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security   Alles said in a message to Secret Service agents Neither Trump nor the White House has explained the overhaul of DHS  but the president s anger over a recent surge in migrants from Central America has been well documented  The DHS oversees immigration and border security The Republican president made stopping illegal immigration a centerpiece in his run for office in 2016  promising to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico  Trump has said he will make border security a key part of his campaign for re election in 2020 Senior senators from both parties said they were concerned about a vacuum in leadership at the agency  which also oversees the Secret Service  the Coast Guard  the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration  among other critical functions Ron Johnson  the Republican chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  said in a statement that he was  concerned with a growing leadership void within the department tasked with addressing some of the most significant problems facing the nation  Dianne Feinstein  the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee  said at least 10 top positions in the department were being filled with acting officials   The purge of senior leadership at the Department of Homeland Security is unprecedented and a threat to our national security   Feinstein said in a statement  The Secret Service  which is responsible for protecting senior U S  officials including the president and vice president  former presidents and visiting heads of state  came under scrutiny last week after a Chinese woman carrying electronic devices was charged with bluffing her way through security checks at Trump s Mar a Lago resort in Florida White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said James Murray  a career Secret Service agent  would take over the agency in May Alles had run the Secret Service for two years and served in the U S  Marine Corps for 35 years before retiring as a major general in 2011 LONG LIST OF DEPARTURESAlles was the latest in a long list of senior officials to leave the Trump administration  including the secretaries of state  defense  homeland security  interior  veterans affairs and health and human services  the attorney general and numerous senior White House aides The first sign of Trump s overhaul of Homeland Security came late on Thursday  when he abruptly pulled his nomination of Ron Vitiello as director of U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  part of DHS Trump addressed the decision perfunctorily to reporters as part of a policy change  going in a tougher direction  It was followed by the resignation of Nielsen on Sunday  A senior administration official said Trump asked Nielsen to step down  On Twitter  Trump said Kevin McAleenan  the U S  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  would become acting DHS secretary CNN reported that L  Francis Cissna  director of the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services agency  and department General Counsel John Mitnick were also expected to leave their positions soon  The White House and DHS did not respond to requests for comment Trump in recent weeks empowered his hard line conservative aide Stephen Miller to lead the administration s border policies  CNN said Nielsen had been a trusted aide to John Kelly  Trump s first DHS secretary and later his chief of staff  with whom he had an often difficult relationship Nielsen and Trump had often clashed over immigration issues during her 16 months in the job  Her departure had been long rumored particularly after criticism of the administration s 2018 family separation policy at the border with Mexico and as U S  border officials estimated that 100 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in March  the highest level in a decade Trump was so frustrated about the surge in migrants that he announced he would cut off U S  aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador   Reporting by Roberta Rampton  Additional reporting by Makini Brice and Doina Chiacu  Editing by Will Dunham and Peter Cooney  

SAN SALVADOR  El Salvador   California Gov  Gavin Newsom says his visit to El Salvador is a counter to President Donald Trump s  demoralizing  and  toxic  rhetoric about Central American migrants The Democratic governor says he wants Salvadorans to know people in the United States want to understand their struggles Newsom s trip began Sunday and lasts through Tuesday  He began with a visit to the tomb of Saint Oscar Romero  the Salvadoran priest who was assassinated in 1980 over his advocacy for the poor Newsom s trip will also include meetings with El Salvador s president and president elect as well as the U S  ambassador It comes as the Trump administration moves to cut aid to El Salvador  Honduras and Guatemala because the administration believes they have failed to stop people from fleeing to the United States California is home to the nation s largest Salvadoran population and its busiest border crossing  

The 2020 United States presidential campaign is already in full swing in Latin America  Four hot button issues that helped propel President Trump to the White House in 2016 are already coming into play in his approach with the region  and they are being driven by two parallel electoral strategies  appeals to his political base nationwide on immigration  drugs and trade  and a hard sell directed at South Florida on Cuba and Venezuela Since he announced his candidacy in 2015  Mr  Trump has treated Mexico as a proxy and scapegoat  particularly on immigration and trade  two issues on which he promised a radical policy shift  Calls to build  the wall  on the United States Mexico border became shorthand for a tough  aggressive stance on these issues that reliably rallies and excites Mr  Trump s hard core supporters But closing down the border  as the president threatened to do recently  would hurt both countries and cause irreparable damage to what is arguably the United States  most crucial relationship  On Thursday  under pressure from Republicans in Congress  he backed off that threat  only to issue another one   We re going to give them a one year warning  and if the drugs don t stop or largely stop  we re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products  particularly cars  Until now  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico has done a great deal to accommodate Mr  Trump  including working out an updated Nafta agreement and allowing Central American refugees to remain in Mexico while their asylum claims are being adjudicated  The move to close the border will test the limits of Mr  López Obrador s forbearance  On March 29  the Mexican foreign minister  Marcelo Ebrard  said on Twitter   Mexico does not act on the basis of threats  We are a great neighbor  Perhaps just as outrageous  Mr  Trump also announced that he would cut aid to the three countries of Central America s so called  Northern Triangle    Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras   citing their failure to curb the continuing mass outflow of migrants headed for the United States  This move has led some to speculate that Mr  Trump is seeking to deepen the crises in these countries  which could result in exploding migration flows and that could pose a  real  national security crisis on the United States Mexico border  thus justifying the president s hard line policies and providing a powerful campaign issue It remains to be seen whether Mr  Trump even has the authority to cut off congressionally appropriated funding  or if he ll follow through on these threats  But the announcement understandably left the governments of Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador bewildered  having done everything to accommodate the United States  The Guatemalan and Honduran governments sought to curry favor with the Trump administration by moving  or considering moving  their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem  Mr  Trump s announcement is particularly insulting to El Salvador s incoming president  Nayib Bukele  On a recent visit to Washington  Mr  Bukele unveiled a much tougher policy on Venezuela and pledged to review the outgoing government s decision to break with Taiwan and recognize China   both diplomatic wins for the Trump administration  Moreover  there is evidence that United States assistance is helping reduce migration from El Salvador On the drug question  too  the president is posturing to shore up his political base for the campaign  The Colombian president  Ivan Duque  recently met with Mr  Trump and vowed to pursue a United States backed strategy to bring down rising levels of coca production  But that wasn t enough  Mr  Duque was reportedly taken aback when Mr  Trump told reporters   he  Duque  said how he was going to stop drugs  More drugs are coming out of Colombia right now than before he was president   so he has done nothing for us   The title of an article that ran in the Colombian weekly magazine  Semana  was telling   With Friends Like These  The Colombian president deserves better treatment  Mr  Duque has been the Trump administration s most steadfast regional partner in pressuring the regime in neighboring Venezuela  His government is struggling to cope with over 1 3 million Venezuelans who have fled to Colombia  As the United States presidential campaign picks up steam  United States Colombia ties are in danger of becoming  re narcotized   which would undermine efforts in recent years to broaden the bilateral agenda The Trump administration s approach toward Venezuela and Cuba should be distinguished from issues of nationwide concern such as immigration  drugs  and trade  Still  there is little question that domestic politics  largely focused on South Florida  is a key element helping to shape policy  More ideological factors  advanced less by Mr  Trump himself and more by his national security adviser  John Bolton  and Marco Rubio  the Florida senator  are also relevant  The Trump administration s sustained pressure on the Venezuelan dictatorship  carried out in concert with hemispheric and European allies  has rightly provided badly needed support for a democratic transition to a beleaguered Venezuela  But the United States  agenda in Venezuela is tightly linked to the administration s pursuit of regime change in Cuba  as Mr  Bolton has repeatedly made clear  Though in Latin America there is no love lost for the Cuban regime  the region is more cautious about Cuba than Venezuela  Most Latin Americans consider the past six decades of United States policy toward Cuba  aside from the two year opening under Obama  to be a failure and strongly oppose any new threats and punishments To be sure  infelicitous phrases by Mr  Trump and other senior administration officials like   All options are on the table   and   I wish Nicolás Maduro and his top advisers a long  quiet retirement  living on a nice beach somewhere   may draw cheers  help deliver votes  and generate money in a critical swing state in 2020  But they also evoke possible military action and  as a result  risk weakening or dividing the broad coalition that has been forged on Venezuela  To preserve this coalition   a major asset for the United States  Venezuela policy   the Trump administration needs to keep its posturing for electoral purposes in check  Invoking the  socialism  boogeyman in Venezuela as a way to attack the Democratic Party for its health care and New Green Deal proposals shows how the hemisphere s worst crisis could be used in the presidential campaign It would be naïve to call for a moratorium on theatrics as November 2020 looms  Playing on domestic politics with Latin American issues may work for President Trump as he pursues a second term  Still  it is crucial not to completely lose sight of the national interest  which means investing wisely in Central America and cooperating closely with Mexico  Mr  Trump needs to stick with the broad coalition on Venezuela  eschew any suggestion of military action there and any reference to regime change in Cuba  These issues should command bipartisan support  If not handled well  they could have consequences for the United States policy in the region for decades to come  RelatedOpinion   Someone Is Always Trying to Kill You April 5  2019Trump Wants to Cut Aid to Central America  Here Are Some of the Dozens of U S  Funded

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Monday that he was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization  the first time that the United States has named part of another nation s government as that type of official threat The designation imposes wide ranging economic and travel sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as well as organizations  companies and individuals with ties to it  Iran s Revolutionary Guards carry out operations across the Middle East  train Arab Shiite militias and oversee businesses in Iran Monday s designation  will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime   Mr  Trump said in a statement The designation was opposed by some top Trump administration national security officials who said it could incite retaliation by Tehran against American troops and intelligence officers  It takes effect April 15  but was announced Monday in what American officials described as a chaotic and rushed process In Baghdad  where some Iraqi officials have close ties to Iran  American officials said they had been given no guidance on how to enforce the policy The timing of Mr  Trump s announcement appeared aimed at giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel a final boost in a tight re election campaign before a vote on Tuesday  Mr  Netanyahu and Trump administration officials have said Iran is the greatest threat to Israel  and Mr  Netanyahu immediately thanked Mr  Trump in a Twitter post Mr  Netanyahu has repeatedly raised the specter of the Iranian threat to Israel and tried to reinforce the notion that his close ties to Mr  Trump strengthen Israeli security In thanking Mr  Trump on Twitter  Mr  Netanyahu took credit for the idea of the terrorism designation   Once again you are keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism   Mr  Netanyahu wrote in English  while writing in a separate tweet in Hebrew   Thank you for accepting another important request of mine  Last month  in an effort to bolster Mr  Netanyahu  Mr  Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  the United Nations considers it occupied territory After Mr  Trump s announcement  Iran s Supreme National Security Council said it was designating as a terrorist organization the United States Central Command  which oversees American military operations in the Middle East Iraqi leaders had no immediate reaction  although Karim al Nuri  a senior figure in the Badr Organization  an influential Iraqi Shiite militia  said there may not be much direct effect  But it will put more pressure on Iraq  from Tehran to grow closer to Iran  he said Some American officials said the broad designation potentially covers 11 million members of the Iranian group and affiliated organizations  including the large Basij volunteer militia In its statement about the new designation  the State Department sharply criticized the Quds Force  an elite unit of the Revolutionary Guards led by Qassim Suleimani  That unit and Mr  Suleimani are already under sanctions from lesser terrorism designations Top American intelligence and military officials  including Gen  Joseph F  Dunford Jr   the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  opposed Mr  Trump s action  which they argued would allow Iranian leaders to justify operations against Americans overseas  especially Special Operations units and paramilitary units working under the C I A But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R  Bolton  the national security adviser  pushed for it  a Trump administration official said  The fighting among the senior administration officials intensified after The New York Times disclosed the pending designation last month VideoSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would designate Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization  This is the first time that the United States has labeled a part of another nation s government a foreign terrorist group CreditCreditSaul Loeb Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe final decision belonged to Mr  Pompeo because the State Department controls the list of designated terrorist organizations At the height of the Iraq war in the mid 2000s  Iranian military officials and partners helped train Iraqi Shiite militias to fight American troops  The Defense Department says at least 603 American personnel were killed in Iraq by Iran backed fighters   17 percent of all Americans killed in hostile action there When the Islamic State  a radical Sunni group  took over large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014  the Quds Force helped train Iraqi Shiite militias to retake the territory  The American military also took part in the campaign  meaning the Americans and Iranians were on the same side Many Iraqi officials are opposed to the new terrorist designation  as it could impose travel limits and economic sanctions on some lawmakers in the Shiite led government and other Iraqis who have ties to Iranian officials The new pressure from the Americans also could fuel a popular proposal among Iraqi lawmakers to limit the movements and actions of some 5 000 American troops based in Iraq In recent days  State Department officials had asked Mr  Pompeo to delay any announcement  arguing that the designation could have unintended consequences for unrelated countries  a government official said  But Mr  Pompeo dismissed their concerns Under a provision of the USA Patriot Act  low level officials are empowered to deny entry to foreigners who are associated with an organization that the officials decide meet broad standards for terrorism   even when the United States government has not formally applied a terrorism label to that group Until now  American officials had never interpreted laws as permitting them to deem a government entity a terrorist organization The Trump administration s decision to breach that constraint with the Iranian group raises the question of whether other government intelligence services that use violence   including those of Israel  Pakistan and Russia   also now meet that standard  If so  should American officials deny visas to people who work with those agencies  State Department officials say the rushed announcement meant such policy details have not been worked out The George W  Bush administration considered a range of tough actions on Iran during the Iraq war  but held back  The potential blowback vastly outweighs the benefits   said Jeffrey Prescott  a senior Middle East director under President Barack Obama Wendy R  Sherman  a former top State Department official  said the Obama administration considered designating the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization  but decided against it because there would be no practical payoff given the risks to Americans and the fact the group was already under other sanctions  By designating a foreign military as a foreign terrorist organization  we were putting our troops at risk  particularly our troops in Iraq  next door to Iran   she said The Revolutionary Guards oversaw the previous Iranian nuclear program  and some of the top officers were placed under United States and United Nations sanctions The Obama administration entered into a nuclear deal with Tehran and world powers in 2015  Mr  Trump withdrew the United States from that agreement last year in the start of a crackdown against Iran There are signs that Trump era sanctions on Iran are undermining its budget for foreign military activities  meaning less money for Hezbollah and other Iranian allies  The new terrorism designation could expand on this by further undermining the Revolutionary Guards  finances  

WASHINGTON   White House officials have tried to pressure U S  immigration authorities to release migrants detained at the border into so called sanctuary cities such as San Francisco to retaliate against President Donald Trump s political adversaries  the Washington Post reported on Thursday The Post  which reviewed emails on the issue and spoke to unnamed officials at the Department of Homeland Security  said the White House proposed the measure at least twice in the past six months  Sanctuary cities are those where local officials decline to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report  A DHS spokesman told Reuters in a statement the plan was  a suggestion that was floated and rejected  which ended any further discussion   The Post quoted a White House official as saying the same thing Trump administration officials proposed the measure in November as a caravan traveled through Mexico with mostly migrants from Central American countries toward the southern U S  border  The proposal emerged again in February during a standoff with Democrats over funding the president sought to build a wall on the border  one of the signature issues of his 2016 election campaign and presidency The Post said a Nov  16 email broached the proposal  asking officials at different agencies whether members of the migrant caravan could be detained at the border  then bused to  small  and mid sized sanctuary cities   where local officials refuse to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s district in San Francisco was one of those the White House considered targeting  the Post cited the DHS officials as saying Ashley Etienne  a spokeswoman for Pelosi  denounced the administration for its  cynicism and cruelty  over the plan  Using human beings   including little children   as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable  and in some cases  criminal   she said  adding that Americans had  resoundingly rejected this administration s toxic anti immigrant policies    Reporting by David Alexander and Eric Beech  editing by Grant McCool  

WASHINGTON   In the staid world of the U S  Supreme Court  where decorum and etiquette are prized and silence is enforced by court police  the F word could create quite a stir  Yet that expletive and others will be the focus on Monday when the nine justices hear arguments in a free speech case brought by Los Angeles based clothing designer Erik Brunetti  His streetwear brand  FUCT    which sounds like  but is spelled differently than  a profanity   was denied a trademark by the U S  Patent and Trademark Office  Brunetti has tried to calm concern about the potential for foul language during arguments in the ornate courtroom  In a written brief  his lawyer told the justices  the discussion will be purely clinical  analogous to when medical terms are discussed  At issue is a provision of U S  trademark law that lets the trademark office deny requests for trademarks on  immoral  and  scandalous  words and symbols  Brunetti  50  is challenging the law as an infringement of his right to freedom of expression  protected by the U S  Constitution s First Amendment In 2017  a Washington based federal appeals court ruled in his favor  President Donald Trump s administration has appealed that ruling to the conservative majority Supreme Court  The provision at issue has been on the books for more than a century Uttering profanities inside the walls of the Supreme Court is one thing  The main concern  the administration said  is all the expletives and sexually graphic imagery that would flow into the marketplace if the law were to be struck down For Brunetti  the government s fears are hypothetical  There are always going to be people who are offended  but you can t control how everybody thinks   Brunetti said in an interview   When it has to do with the First Amendment  it s a slippery slope  The justices struck down a similar law forbidding the registration of  disparaging  trademarks in a 2017 case involving an Asian American dance rock band called The Slants  a name that trademark officials deemed offensive to Asians  Speech may not be banned even if it expresses ideas that offend  the court ruled  Banning vulgar terms and sexually indecent images is different because it does not discriminate against anyone s viewpoint  U S  Solicitor General Noel Francisco  the administration s top Supreme Court lawyer  said in a written brief  Instead  it  advances the government s interest in encouraging the use of marks that are appropriate for all audiences  including children  The federal government  Francisco added  should not be forced through the trademark system to actively promote words and images the public would find shocking or profane  GRAPHIC  Major Supreme Court cases of 2018 2019 term   https   tmsnrt rs 2V2T0Uf FRIENDS U CAN T TRUST Brunetti  who grew up skateboarding  saw a market for edgy streetwear and founded FUCT in 1990  with a focus on questioning authority   That was the cleverness of it  that a majority of people think it s pronounced  fucked    he said  The acronym  he added  also means  Friends U Can t Trust  A trademark would make it easier to protect his brand against counterfeiters  But the FUCT trademark application  filed in 2011  was denied  The trademark office said the brand would be perceived as the phonetic equivalent of the profanity  observing that Brunetti s products contained sexual imagery  misogyny and violence  That sounds to me like every movie that has come out over the last 40 years   Brunetti said  adding that his products are actually quite tame   Should we start regulating the entertainment industry then  The American Civil Liberties Union  backing Brunetti in the case  noted that the Supreme Court in 1971 upheld the free speech rights of a Vietnam War opponent convicted of  offensive conduct  for wearing a  Fuck the Draft  jacket  We don t want the government picking and choosing the messages it approves and disapproves of   ACLU attorney Emerson Sykes said  The court has decided other cases featuring profanities more recently  In 2009  it upheld a federal crackdown on  fleeting expletives  uttered on network television  including actress singer Cher s use of the F word at the 2002 Billboard Music Awards Brunetti used to sell his wares in some retail stores  but has moved exclusively online  where his monthly lines sell out within hours  Among his recent products  A hoodie that reads   We are Fuct  In its 2017 ruling in Brunetti s favor  the U S  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit   a court that specializes in intellectual property   noted the ubiquitous nature of vulgar content  with or without trademarks  and skewered the government s attempts to police it  In this electronic Internet age  to the extent that the government seeks to protect the general population from scandalous material  with all due respect  it has completely failed   the court said  And it said the trademark office applies the law unevenly  Even other words referencing the same foul term as Brunetti s have been approved  such as Fcuk  and Mutha Effin Bingo  the court said  Meanwhile some powerful messages  such as  Fuck Cancer   run the risk of rejection  The Trump administration tried to emphasize the importance of targeting vulgar material  filing with the Federal Circuit a list of rejected registrations including drawings of sex acts  pictures of genitalia  and phrases like  Fuck Off You Fucking Fuck  The administration said even more graphic and vulgar trademarks would be submitted for approval if this law were to be struck down  with a ripple effect that could reach beyond trademarks because all levels of government commonly exclude explicit pictures and profanity from places or programs they create  Even military cemeteries or public transportation advertising authorities could lose control over whether that graphic or profane content would be displayed on their property   the administration said  For a graphic on major

The U S  oil and gas industry is praised by supporters for boosting America to the forefront of global production and attacked by critics who blame it for sowing doubt about the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is changing the Earth s climate The American Petroleum Institute is the energy industry s lobbyist in Washington  These days it is led by Mike Sommers  previously the chief of staff for former Republican House Speaker John Boehner Recently Sommers talked with The Associated Press about the energy industry  climate change  offshore drilling and other issues  His answers here have been edited for brevity Q  The U S  is now the world s biggest oil producer  What does that mean for the industry and investors A  The most important component is what it means to the United States  It s given our lawmakers an incredible amount of flexibility to help lead the world  No longer are we subject to the whims of an oil cartel in the Middle East  We re the world s swing oil and gas producer  and that s exciting for American leadership Q  At a recent big energy conference in Houston  there was talk by Shell and BP about investing in renewables  Are U S  oil companies going to be left behind A  I don t think there s any threat of them being left behind     They are committed to reducing their methane emissions Q  Are you worried about Norway s sovereign wealth fund reducing its oil and gas holdings  Could other investors follow A  This industry of course relies on the availability of capital  and you know we re continuing to focus on making sure that investors in this industry understand everything that this industry has done to reduce the environmental footprint while meeting consumer demands for more affordable energy Q  Is current U S  production sustainable A  The reports that we look at  particularly  the U S  Energy Information Administration   project that this continued production within the United States is going to go on for a long time  The United States as a leader in this space is good of course for the American consumer  but it s good for American industry as well  The  International Energy Agency  report that I recently saw was that even under the rosiest scenarios for renewables  oil and natural gas will still provide over 50 percent of the world s energy needs in 2050  So the future is bright for this industry Q  Will U S  offshore oil drilling increase A  We need access to these offshore resources to continue to supply the American consumer s demand for these products  so we re working with the administration to make sure that these resources are available  for  the opening up of new resources off both the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico Q  You ve given up on the California coast A  Our focus is really on the Atlantic and continued exploration in the Gulf Coast Q  Are you happy with the Trump administration on energy A  This is an administration that has really focused on what they call the energy dominance agenda  and I think that they have been really focused on making sure that consumers have access to safe  reliable and affordable energy that is also produced in an environmentally sustainable way  That s what this industry delivers on every single day Q  In your state of the industry speech  you seemed to dismiss the Green New Deal A  We know that climate change is real  but we also know that the solutions to climate change have to be real as well  This country has undergone a real energy revolution in the last 12 years as a consequence of the fracking boom in the United States  and that has allowed for  a shift  from coal to natural gas  and that has led to the air being cleaner today than it has been in a generation Q  Are environmentalists wrong because they think we should move directly to renewables and not use natural gas as a so called bridge fuel A  Of course wind has a future in the United States  and of course so does solar  but natural gas has to be around when the sun doesn t shine and the wind doesn t blow  Consumers are demanding more sustainable fuels  This industry is responding to that  but they also continue to demand that those fuels be affordable  and that s what natural gas has delivered on and will continue to deliver on I think for many  many generations to come Q  Even in places like the Permian Basin in West Texas there is some local opposition or concern about the impact of fracking on water use  truck traffic and pollution  What s API doing about that A  One of the reasons why those continue to be concerns is because we don t have the infrastructure built up to support the energy boom  So I do think that those issues are going to continue to diminish as we are able particularly to build pipelines to these communities to support the boom that s going on  particularly in the Permian  But you know some of the same people that are complaining about that environmental impact of trucks  etc  are also those that are blocking the infrastructure  There are new technologies that are being advanced in the oil fields today to make sure that we are recycling water  for example Q  What do you dislike about the administration s trade policy A  We are very concerned about some of the     trade policies that have come from Washington over the last couple of years  For example  there s a company in Midland  Texas  that can t complete a pipeline because they can t get the steel that need they need as a consequence of some of the quotas that have been imposed  We need to get those quotas and those tariffs eliminated as quickly as possible  We also have concerns about the ongoing trade fight with China that has led to tariffs on U S  LNG  liquefied natural gas   Once you lose those markets they are hard to get back  so we re hopeful that the administration s efforts to get to end the trade war with China prove fruitful very soon  

Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter WASHINGTON   As the Trump administration prepares to drastically weaken Obama era rules restricting vehicle pollution  nervous automakers are devising a strategy to handle their worst case scenario  a divided American auto market  with some states following President Trump s weakened rules while others stick with the tougher ones The effort is increasingly urgent because the Trump administration has now settled on the key details of its rollback plan  according to two people familiar with the matter  The new rules would all but eliminate the Obama era restrictions  essentially freezing standards at about 37 miles per gallon  compared to 54 5 miles per gallon required by the current rules  The policy makes it a near certainty that California and 13 other states  collectively representing roughly one third of the United States auto market  will keep enforcing the stricter rules  splitting the national auto market in two Although Mr  Trump has billed his rollback as a boon to the auto industry  automakers say the split market outcome would be a logistical and financial nightmare for them  Their current strategy centers on selling completely different kinds of cars in different parts of the country   chiefly hybrids or electric vehicles in states like California  and less efficient SUVs  which American car buyers love  in other states But automakers recognize it would be easy for some buyers to simply cross state lines to buy what they want  We could see a scenario where there are limited choices for consumers in the high fuel economy states  or a stampede at the border to buy cars in the states that follow the federal standards   said Gloria Bergquist  a vice president at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  In that case  Ms  Bergquist said  states with stricter standards might have to create new rules against buying cars from other states   Because this is all such new territory  no one s quite sure how this is going to work   she said   We re trying to figure it out  But it s going to be a headache  Automakers have told White House officials that they dread this split market outcome  but it appears increasingly likely because California and the 13 other states that follow its strict state pollution rules have said they plan to sue the White House in order to keep the current standards in place The industry had initially asked Mr  Trump to loosen the auto pollution rules  which were among Mr  Obama s signature policies aimed at fighting climate change  However  the companies also asked that Mr  Trump strike a deal with California and the other states to maintain a single national standard  But the White House has stopped negotiating with California The administration has settled on the key details of its rollback  according to two people familiar with the terms  The plan  which is being jointly written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department  would require automakers to raise the fuel economy of their fleets by about 1 percent annually between 2021 and 2026  according to these people  That would be a sharp reduction from the 5 percent annual increase now required In addition  the Trump plan would also give automakers credits for using cleaner technologies  like more modern refrigerants in air conditioners  something that most already do  The Trump plan would also revoke the legal right of California and other states to set their own  stronger standards  setting up the legal clash between the federal government and the states The plan is expected to be published in the next few months  at which point it formally goes into effect  The president has made it clear he wants automakers to publicly support the rollback when it is announced   Every administration wants the industry to stand with them in the Rose Garden   Ms  Bergquist said   But regulatory certainty is really important for automakers  If the nation s auto market does get split in two  the challenge for automakers will come specifically in figuring out how to sell a radically different mix of cars in different states  For example  in states like California  automakers would have to demonstrate that the average mileage of all the cars they sell is much higher  about 54 miles per gallon by 2025  than in states like Utah  where the new Trump standard of about 38 miles per gallon would be in effect  But because Americans have shown a growing preference for SUVs over thriftier vehicles like electrics  manufacturers might have to significantly cut prices on electric vehicles in the high mileage states  a potentially money losing proposition for them  while raising the prices of gas guzzlers  Meanwhile  auto lots in low mileage states might hold a completely different mix of cars at different prices  If car buyers simply cross state lines to buy gas guzzlers and bring them into the cleaner standard states  it could create more regulatory headaches for the companies  which could also be subject to fines from high mileage states if they fail to comply Representatives of Ford and General Motors  who spoke on condition of anonymity because the administration s final plans have not been made public  said their companies felt torn between backing the Trump plan  which could hurt their bottom line  or opposing it and siding with California  which could bring retaliation from Mr  Trump In particular  automakers fear that the administration would retaliate against them by imposing trade sanctions like tariffs on auto imports  That could raise the cost of American vehicles  many of which are manufactured overseas A recent a draft report from the Commerce Department concluded that auto imports threaten national security  according to one person who viewed it  A final version of that report has been sent to the White House  and while it has not been made public  the conclusion that auto imports are a national security threat would pave the way for Mr  Trump to impose tariffs on auto imports  They will have to choose between Trump and California   said Margo T  Oge  a former senior E P A  official who works on auto pollution policy issues  If you go with Trump  it solves the short term temper tantrum and the threat of trade wars on the horizon   she said   But that is also taking a big legal risk  Because in the long term  California could win the legal fight to keep its state standards  Trump is right now  but California is forever  Mr  Trump has frequently turned to tariffs on foreign products as a wide ranging source of leverage to try to exact concessions from both foreign governments and multinational companies A senior White House official  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record  said the White House still hoped to have the auto industry s backing and was unaware of plans to use trade sanctions as leverage or punishment   The auto industry is important to the White House   the official said   The agencies are still working through the rule making process and no final decisions have been made  In interviews  California officials who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record  noted that California already has in place border laws requiring vehicles brought into the state to meet certain pollution standards  California is prepared to strike at any blow dealt our way and regardless of what comes next  we have laws in place to keep our state moving forward   the state s attorney general  Xavier Becerra  said  Although officials at the E P A  and the Transportation Department have largely settled on the top line numbers of the plan  they are months from completing the accompanying legal and technical documents required to justify such a major rule change  according to three people familiar with the plan  Those people noted that the process of creating the documents was stalled by the 35 day government shutdown earlier this year ImageAndrew R  Wheeler  administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThose document delays mean the final plan is unlikely to be made public until at least late spring or early summer  these people said  The release date is significant because it would prompt the expected legal battle  which is likely to end up before the Supreme Court  But if the plan isn t released until this summer  it means the legal challenges aren t likely to reach the Supreme Court during Mr  Trump s first term in office The risk is that  should a Democrat defeat Mr  Trump in his re election bid  the new administration could simply decline to defend the plan in court  The longer they wait on this  the easier it will be for the next administration to undo it   said Jody Freeman  a professor of environmental law at Harvard University who served as legal counsel in the Obama administration  Ana Swanson contributed reporting from Washington  and Hiroko Tabuchi from New York For more news on climate and the environment  follow

The arrest in London of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange ends one bizarre saga  but opens a legal drama that is likely to stretch over many years and could probe uncharted areas of press freedoms and national security in the United States in the digital era  There is good reason to be watchful as the case unfolds Mr  Assange  a 47 year old Australian  had spent almost seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy  initially to avoid arrest by Swedish authorities in a sexual assault investigation that has since been dropped  then British charges of skipping bail  But extradition to the United States was what Mr  Assange really feared  and what the cat and mouse game was always about It was in the United States that the materials posted on WikiLeaks created the greatest furor  first through the publication of a trove of classified documents supplied by an Army private  Chelsea Manning  and then by releasing material stolen from the computers of Hillary Clinton s campaign The Obama administration was wary of pursuing Mr  Assange because WikiLeaks was essentially involved in investigative work common to a free press  But the Trump administration saw Mr  Assange and WikiLeaks as targets as soon as it took office   Mr  Trump loved WikiLeaks in 2016 when it was embarrassing top officials of the Clinton campaign   Two years ago  as director of the C I A   Mike Pompeo labeled WikiLeaks  a nonstate hostile intelligence service  after it released a cache of C I A  hacking tools  Efforts got underway then to build a case against Mr  Assange  This was confirmed through an inadvertent mention in a federal court filing last November Mr  Assange  meanwhile  managed to exhaust his welcome at the Ecuadorean Embassy  and on Thursday British police officers unceremoniously bundled the scraggly bearded refugee off in a van  Soon after  Scotland Yard acknowledged that it was also acting on an American extradition warrant  after which a federal indictment was unsealed in the United States charging Mr  Assange with conspiring to hack a government computer The single charge is straightforward  It alleges that Mr  Assange helped the Army private break into a government computer in 2010 to steal classified and sensitive documents  According to the indictment  when Ms  Manning told Mr  Assange that she had no more material to send him  he replied   Curious eyes never run dry in my experience   Ms  Manning served almost seven years of a 35 year sentence for the leak  and is now back in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks The still unproven charge is far less contentious than had it been  as widely anticipated  for espionage related crimes  That would have been a direct challenge to the distinction between a journalist exposing abuse of power through leaked materials   something traditional newspapers like The Times do all the time   and a foreign agent seeking to undermine the security of the United States through theft or subterfuge These questions will arise in any event   starting with the extradition hearings  at which Mr  Assange s lawyers are likely to argue that the American charges are politically motivated  And if Britain does extradite him  there is no certainty that the Trump administration  with its combative stance toward the press and its documented recent antipathy for Mr  Assange  will not throw more charges at him The issues WikiLeaks raises are vitally important  The responsibilities  ethics and rules of journalism are fast changing in an era when terabytes of secret data can be dumped in a flash  and when hostile governments like Russia s can burrow into foreign computers for compromising information and then launder it through other channels The case of Mr  Assange  who got his start as a computer hacker  illuminates the conflict of freedom and harm in the new technologies  and could help draw a sharp line between legitimate journalism and dangerous cybercrime  Once in the United States  moreover  he could become a useful source on how Russia orchestrated its attacks on the Clinton campaign The administration has begun well by charging Mr  Assange with an indisputable crime  But there is always a risk with this administration   one that labels the free press as  the enemy of the people    that the prosecution of Mr  Assange could become an assault on the First Amendment and whistle blowers More coverage of Julian Assange and WikiLeaksJulian Assange Arrested in London as U S  Unseals Hacking Conspiracy IndictmentApril 11

WASHINGTON   U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined on Wednesday to publicly say the Trump administration still backs a two state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians  We are now working with many parties to share what our vision  is  as to how to solve this problem   Pompeo told a U S  Senate hearing where he was pressed for a response on the issue He said the administration  has been working on a set of ideas  for Middle East peace  that we hope to present before too long   adding that he hoped they would provide a basis for discussions on resolving the Israeli Palestinian conflict Democratic Senator Tim Kaine asked Pompeo  a former Republican member of the House of Representatives  if he thought a peace agreement including one state for Israel and one state for the Palestinians was an outdated idea  It s certainly an idea that s been around a long time  senator   Pompeo responded  Ultimately the individuals in the region will sort this out   the secretary of state said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re election on Wednesday  and a record fifth term in office  with religious rightist parties set to hand him a parliamentary majority  despite a close contest against his main centrist challenger  a vote tally showed In a rare turn during the campaign toward the Israeli Palestinian conflict  Netanyahu alarmed Palestinians by pledging to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re elected  Palestinians seek a state there and in the Gaza Strip  with East Jerusalem as its capital That came after Trump signed a proclamation during Netanyahu s visit to Washington on March 25  officially granting U S  recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli territory  a dramatic departure from decades of American policy The move  which Trump announced in a tweet days prior  was widely seen as an attempt to boost Netanyahu as he ran for re election on April 9 Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally  The Trump administration has been promising for many months that it would roll out a Middle East peace plan after Israel s election   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Lesley Wroughton  editing by Jonathan Oatis  

WASHINGTON   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on President Donald Trump Tuesday to sign into law a resolution ending American involvement in the war in Yemen  The situation in Yemen     has left an indelible scar and stain on the conscience of the world   Pelosi told reporters  She said the resolution passed by Congress last week sets  a standard for what kinds of military engagements we take part in  Trump has already pledged to veto the measure Under the War Powers Resolution enacted in 1973  the president is required to  consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities  The White House statement threatening a veto argued U S  support for the Saudi led coalition in Yemen does not constitute engaging in  hostilities   meaning the War Powers Act doesn t apply  It also said the bill raises  serious constitutional concerns  The conflict in Yemen has ground on for more than four years  killing thousands and leaving millions on the brink of famine Opposition to U S  involvement in the Saudi led war in Yemen grew in the aftermath of the killing of U S  based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabian agents last year  Lawmakers from both parties are frustrated Trump hasn t done more to condemn the kingdom s leaders after the incident Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was questioned Tuesday by lawmakers about the Trump administration s response to the Khashoggi killing  Pompeo told a Senate subcommittee the administration was  continuing to pursue facts  and  when we find the facts we will apply the law appropriately  The State Department announced Monday it would deny entry to 16 Saudis over their roles in Khashoggi s killing  The action was taken under the 2019 State Department appropriations bill  which requires Pompeo to deny entry to individuals  involved in significant corruption or gross violations of human rights  Saudi Arabia has been a key U S  security and economic partner for decades  The U S  has supported the kingdom s involvement in Yemen since 2015 with intelligence sharing  logistical support and inflight refueling Trump administration officials argue withdrawing American involvement could diminish chances for a negotiated peace and lead to even higher numbers of civilian casualties  

WASHINGTON   The Education Department failed to approve a single application for federal student loan relief in the second half of last year  according to new department data that signals that students who claim they were cheated by their colleges cannot count on help from Washington anytime soon The department neither approved nor denied any relief claims filed by students under the so called borrower defense program from June to December 2018  even after a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration s foot dragging was illegal  In October  the judge ordered the Education Department to enforce a long delayed Obama era rule that expanded and expedited loan relief for defrauded students  many of whom attended for profit colleges Amid that inaction  the number of pending claims has swelled to more than 150 000   over double the number of applications the department inherited from the previous administration  And with no firm timeline to process them  advocates say the department has referred borrowers to the Treasury Department to have their tax refunds garnished to offset debts that have piled up while their claim is pending Liz Hill  a spokeswoman for the Education Department  blamed the delay on the swirl of lawsuits filed by advocates pressing for a more generous response to loan relief applicants  Pending litigation has slowed down the department s processing to provide relief to additional borrowers   Ms  Hill said   We will fully implement the 2016 borrower defense regulations and ensure those who qualify for discharge receive it  About 22 000 approved applications that are waiting to be discharged are delayed because of lawsuits  the department said  as it  continues to assess alternatives to provide a fair  balanced and consistent approach for legitimate borrower defense applications  Ms  Hill added that the department was taking steps to increase its capacity to manage applications  which in recent months have been coming in at nearly 2 000 a week Last month  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos offered no such assurances when pressed by senators about the backlog  Don t you have a heart   Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the No  2 Democrat  asked Ms  DeVos at a hearing on the department s budget  where he cited 140 000  victim students waiting on your department to give them relief so they can get on with their lives  He noted that many of the students were defrauded by predatory for profit schools  which Ms  DeVos has been accused of favoring with her policies  Nine percent of high school graduates go to for profit colleges and universities  but 34 percent of loan defaults belong to those students  No student should be defrauded  and if fraud is involved  there are consequences  and there will be consequences   Ms  DeVos replied   But we should not be judging institutions by their tax status  Let s be very honest here  there are bad actors on both sides of the equation  She added  with some indignance   Let s talk about the nonprofits that are doing a bad job  that are subject to bribes  that are lying in order to improve their U S  News and World Report statistics   referring to the recent college admissions scandal rocking Ivy League and other elite institutions  Since taking office  Ms  DeVos has tried to overhaul the 2016 process started by the Obama administration that was supposed to pave an easier road for students to secure loan relief after their colleges are found to have misled them with inflated claims of false promises of jobs  The Obama administration approved nearly 30 000 such claims  estimated at  450 million  in its last year in office  The Education Department approved 16 155 from Jan  1  2017 to December 31  2018 The Obama administration rewrote the borrower defense rule  which was virtually unknown until 2015  when two large for profit chains  ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges  began to crumble  The new rule was supposed to take effect in 2017 But Ms  DeVos delayed issuing what she said amounted to  free money  and has moved to narrow its scope to only forgive debts of students who  regardless of their schools  actions  fail to secure gainful employment and can prove they were otherwise harmed A 2017 report from the department s inspector general found that the Obama process had some flaws  Ms  DeVos  instituted a tiered system to grant some borrowers partial relief  but those measures were struck down by the courts  The department then blew a deadline to rewrite the rules  which were supposed to go into force this year Ms  Hill  the department spokeswoman  said that under Ms  DeVos  the department has discharged nearly 50 000 borrower defense claims  the bulk of which were queued up by the Obama administration  totaling more than  534 million She said it has also enforced part of the 2016 Obama regulation that automatically relieves students of debt when a school closes  As of February  the department discharged approximately 51 000 loans for 15 000 borrowers  totaling more than  158 million But applications have continued to pile up as the department charts its next move Education Department officials released data in response to a request from Senator Patty Murray  Democrat of Washington  showing that it still had 158 000 pending claims  The data covered the period from September to December  but officials wrote that those had not changed since the previous quarter The department did not say whether it has approved or denied any borrower defense claims in 2019  There s nothing stopping Secretary DeVos from providing relief to struggling borrowers today  and she needs to begin approving claims immediately so students who were cheated out of their education and savings get the relief they are entitled to   Ms  Murray said in a statement Eileen Connor  the director of litigation at Harvard Law School s Project on Predatory Student Lending  said that she had borrowers who had claims pending from as far back as four years The project  which represents thousands of students from ITT Tech and Corinthian  said that it had over 14 000 applications from ITT Tech pending at the department  Only 33 have been approved  and those were by the Obama administration  Zero have been approved under Ms  DeVos Debt on the loans has continued to grow  Ms  Connor said  In lawsuits  the group has described how borrowers have experienced anxiety  fear and psychological and financial distress caused by delays The project has won several lawsuits against Ms  DeVos  But it said that the department continued to ignore crucial court rulings  including one that found the department could not take tax refunds of former Corinthian College students to pay their student loans while they have borrower defense applications pending  The department s delay is not neutral   Ms  Connor said   It s harming students   

WASHINGTON   In a major test case  Medicare is poised to cover a promising but expensive new type of cancer treatment  with significant restrictions meant to hold down the cost Cancer patients  doctors and drug companies are urging the Trump administration to remove the restrictions and broaden coverage so more patients can benefit from the treatment  known as CAR T cell therapy  or CAR T  But insurance companies are pushing for the restrictions The treatment is manufactured specifically for each patient  and many more such  personalized medicines  are in the pipeline  Medicare s final decision  expected in the next few weeks  will influence commercial insurers and state Medicaid programs  which often follow its lead Medicare and other insurers typically pay for drugs as they are used  from month to month and year to year  By contrast  the CAR T treatments generate high costs up front  but the benefits could last for years The Food and Drug Administration has approved two CAR T products to treat certain blood cancers  Kymriah  made by Novartis  with a list price of  373 000 or  475 000  depending on the type of cancer  and Yescarta  made by Gilead Sciences  with a list price of  373 000 The treatments have been remarkably effective in some patients who had a dismal prognosis after exhausting other options  Researchers around the country are conducting more than 450 clinical trials to explore other uses of CAR T medicines that work in similar ways The Trump administration has proposed covering CAR T therapy when it is prescribed by a cancer specialist and given in a hospital to Medicare patients whose cancer has not responded to other treatments like chemotherapy and radiation  Medicare would also cover the treatment for patients whose cancer returns  causing a relapse after a period of improvement Seema Verma  the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  has described CAR T as  an entirely new approach to treating serious and even life threatening diseases  Dr  Francis S  Collins  the director of the National Institutes of Health  said that harnessing the power of a patient s immune system in this way was a  marvel of modern medicine   But  because of the need to personalize the preparation of cells for every patient   he said   costs are quite high  and it could be truly challenging to scale up use of the technology  Officials will increasingly confront such challenges as they try to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to the latest treatments at an affordable cost CAR T therapy sounds like science fiction  Immune cells   T cells   are removed from a patient s blood  sent to a laboratory where they are genetically engineered to recognize and attack cancer cells  and then sent back to the hospital for infusion into the patient The total cost of treatment  including the CAR T infusion  doctors  services and hospital stays  can easily exceed  750 000  This looks like a big price tag   said Dr  Caron A  Jacobson  director of a cell therapy program at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston   But when you actually consider what you are paying for over the course of someone s lifetime  and you think about the cost of other therapies that this is replacing  it actually is not astronomical  There is no national Medicare policy for covering CAR T cell therapy  The request for a Medicare coverage decision came from one of the nation s largest insurers  UnitedHealth Group  which expressed concern that  CAR T therapies could create significant financial risks  for the government and for private Medicare Advantage plans UnitedHealth is the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans  with about five million people enrolled in its plans  The private plans receive a fixed monthly payment from the government to provide the full range of services covered by Medicare America s Health Insurance Plans  a trade group for insurers  also urged caution  saying   There is currently limited evidence for CAR T therapies  But Bonnie Falbo of Charlottesville  Va   a caregiver for her 70 year old husband  who has multiple myeloma  said   This treatment is one that could save his life one day  Immunotherapy is the future of cancer care  Approving payment for this therapy right now will save the lives of patients who have run out of other options  Advocates for patients and physician groups said the coverage policy proposed by the Trump administration was too limited and could delay lifesaving treatment for cancer patients who were very ill  We have a new therapy  a result of years of research  and it has been approved by the F D A    said Kirsten A  Sloan  a vice president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network   Let s make sure people have access to it  Let the doctor decide which patients should be eligible  A patient s health care provider is in the best position to determine when and whether a patient will benefit from CAR T cell therapy and should not be limited by a narrow coverage policy  Ted Okon  the executive director of the Community Oncology Alliance  an advocacy group for cancer doctors and patients  said the coverage criteria proposed by the Trump administration were  much more restrictive  than the uses of CAR T therapy permitted in the F D A  approved label Moreover  Mr  Okon said  coverage should not be limited to patients treated at a hospital  as the government proposed   CAR T treatment has been slowly moving to the outpatient setting   he said   Many community oncology practices have the experience and capabilities to administer CAR T treatment  saving money for patients and Medicare  Hospitals providing CAR T therapy said they were trying to figure out how to pay for it Charles N  Kahn III  the president and chief executive of the Federation of American Hospitals  which represents investor owned hospitals  said they faced large financial losses in providing the treatment to Medicare patients  This is a brave new world   Mr  Kahn said   No one anticipated such an extraordinary expense when Medicare s hospital payment formulas were adopted  Under the Trump administration proposal  Medicare would pay for CAR T therapy in patients who have  relapsed or refractory cancer  that has resisted other treatments  CAR T cell therapy shows promise   the administration said in a 39 000 word decision memo  but  the evidence is inadequate to confidently conclude  that it will improve health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries To date  it said   few clinical trials on CAR T cell therapy have been performed  and those data available have limited participation by Medicare beneficiaries   More study is needed  it said So Medicare would cover the procedure only if hospitals agreed to monitor patients  enroll them in a study or  registry  and report detailed data on their medical condition and quality of life for at least two years after treatment Doctors and scientific researchers raised several concerns The eligibility requirements  may exclude some patients who could benefit from treatment   said Cynthia A  Bens  a senior vice president of the Personalized Medicine Coalition  an education and advocacy group Dr  Roy L  Silverstein  the president of the American Society of Hematology  said it was  shortsighted to limit coverage to those patients who have

LEESBURG  Va    U S  House of Representatives Democrats are accusing Republican President Donald Trump of aggravating a crisis situation at the southern U S  border  saying he has not used funds available to help deal with a surge of migrants and exacerbated the problem with his attempts to crack down House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that bipartisan immigration reform  which has eluded Congress and the White House for years  is still the solution  It is in fact  inevitable   Pelosi said on the sidelines of a Democratic party meeting in Leesburg  Virginia  In Washington  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  a Republican  also called for bipartisan discussions on immigration  But he focused on toughening U S  asylum law  a move that Democrats likely would oppose Democrats have not proposed a comprehensive immigration bill since taking the majority in the House this year  Republicans still hold the Senate Instead  Democrats last month proposed legislation offering a pathway to citizenship for more than 2 million undocumented immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children  Known as Dreamers  they face possible deportation The House Democratic bill would also help immigrants from countries hit by civil conflicts or natural disasters who have temporary protected status  known as TPS U S  officers arrested or denied entry to over 103 000 people along the border with Mexico in March  a 35 percent increase over the prior month and more than twice as many as the same period last year  according to data released by U S  Customs and Border Protection this week The steady increase in migrant arrivals  which has been building over the past several months  is driven by a growing number of children and families  especially from Central America  Trump has threatened to close the border  saying the United States is  full   He has urged the building of a wall on the southern border since before he became president in 2016  Recently his ire has been directed at his own officials  Congress  and Latin American countries  who he says have not done enough to stop their citizens from traveling to the United States Pelosi  asked Thursday what should be done at the border  said the bipartisan legislation Trump signed to end a government shutdown in February included money for judges and humanitarian aid  to bring order to the border   but Trump has not used the funds Although a bipartisan effort at comprehensive immigration reform by Democrats and Trump last year failed  Pelosi said such an overhaul still had a chance  I m not giving up on the president on this   Pelosi said   I still say to him   We ve got to have comprehensive immigration reform    Representative Pramila Jayapal  speaking to reporters later  said the Trump administration had manufactured a crisis at the border in part by  stripping away  legal routes to immigration  such as by stopping asylum seekers at legal ports of entry Trying to curb the flow of Central American asylum seekers  the administration has been sending more people back to Mexico to wait for their asylum claims to be heard by U S  courts  Representative David Cicilline said the Trump administration had exacerbated a challenging border situation by not spending money that was appropriated for border facilities and personnel  as well as by cutting off aid to Central American countries for sending migrants to the United States Cicilline  who runs the House Democrats  policy and communications committee  denied Democrats were simply  looking on helplessly  at the problems  But the administration has responsibility in all these areas  And we can appropriate funding and we can pass legislation but ultimately they are responsible for executing the immigration laws in this country   he said   Reporting by Susan Cornwell  Editing by James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   In a White House where no secret is safe for long  one development has remained stubbornly confidential   the contents of a Middle East peace plan authored by President Donald Trump s advisers Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt With Trump having delighted Israelis and angered Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital in 2017 and moving the American Embassy to the holy city last May  a U S  brokered peace deal may seem farther away now than when talks collapsed five years ago Then on Wednesday  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re election  only days after proposing to annex Jewish West Bank settlements  traditionally viewed as illegal by much of the world  The Trump administration has yet to comment on the election eve remarks Aides expect Trump to release the plan once Netanyahu forms a government coalition  and officials say that despite criticism of the administration s moves to date  the plan will demand compromises from both sides That the peace plan has remained a secret is remarkable in a White House where drafts of executive orders  confidential conversations and internal deliberations all find their way to the front pages  Kushner and Greenblatt have limited the plan s distribution over the two years they have been crafting it  It has been kept secret  to ensure people approach it with an open mind  when it is released  a senior administration official said Only four people have regular access   Kushner  Greenblatt  U S  Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Kushner aide Avi Berkowitz  the official said Trump is briefed regularly on the contents but is not believed to have read the entire document of dozens of pages  He is briefed if something interesting is happening or there is an idea they want to run by him   the official said Kushner  a New York real estate developer and husband of Trump s daughter Ivanka  and Greenblatt  a former lawyer for Trump  joined the process knowing little about the tortured  decades long path in search of Arab Israeli peace  Their proposal addresses such core political issues as the status of Jerusalem  and separately aims at helping the Palestinians strengthen their economy Cloaked in secrecy is whether the plan will propose outright the creation of a Palestinian state  the Palestinians  core demand  On Wednesday  Trump s secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the plan would be presented before too long but  when asked  declined to say whether the administration favored a two state solution  long the basis of Middle East peacemaking Not even Trump  who is known to blurt out news whenever he feels like it  has dribbled out details of the peace plan because of the sensitivity He tells his Middle East envoys   If you guys can get this done you re going to be the greatest negotiators in history   said a senior White House official   YOUR CHILDREN S FUTURE When Kushner and Greenblatt began developing their plan in 2017  they asked the parties to look to the future and describe an outcome on each issue that they could accept rather than get locked into historical stances  two officials said  You can t let your grandfather s conflict hold back your children s future  was their message to both sides  one official said Palestinians reject Trump s pro Israel policies  The extremist and militaristic agenda  led by Benjamin Netanyahu  has been emboldened by the Trump administration s reckless policies and blind support   said PLO Executive Committee Member Hanan Ashrawi U S  Vice President Mike Pence  Pompeo and White House national security adviser John Bolton are all kept up to date on the peace plan  but have kept a hands off approach to it  deferring to Kushner  two other officials said The secrecy maintained by Kushner and Greenblatt  even as they refine and polish the plan  has posed something of a challenge for Gulf governments  who want to know the details before committing resources to a Palestinian fund Kushner and Greenblatt toured Gulf states in February to promote the economic part of the plan and get opinions about it  without providing a detailed view of the contents of the more crucial political section One of their stops was in Qatar Qatari Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Lolwah Al Khater  speaking to a small group of reporters in Washington recently  gave no indication that Kushner and Greenblatt provided much in the way of details on the political plan when they visited  I don t think it s still set in stone   she said Dennis Ross  a longtime Middle East envoy and now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  said the U S  team still has  a lot of work to do to make sure that Arab leaders aren t surprised by what s going to be presented  and they need to see it in writing  not verbally  But he said secrecy at this point is understandable  Holding something very close makes sense and it s not taken as a negative by the parties  because in the end  if the content isn t leaking out  it also makes sure that what would be controversial doesn t create an immediate firestorm  There s a logic to that   Ross said   Additional

WASHINGTON   The House will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump s declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border  Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday  the latest in a series of efforts to stop Mr  Trump from securing money that Congress refused to give him for his promised wall  The president s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds  an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority   Ms  Pelosi said in a statement  The House will once again defend our democracy and our Constitution  this time in the courts   she added   No one is above the law or the Constitution  not even the president  The Trump administration has argued that Mr  Trump s moves to spend more taxpayer dollars on border barriers than Congress had agreed to give him are lawful because he is invoking statutes that granted the president the power to move money around under urgent circumstances  Those statutes placed few limits on a president s authority to determine that such situations exist Mr  Trump and his defenders have also noted that presidents have declared national emergencies nearly 60 times since Congress passed the National Emergencies Act in 1976  although critics point out that in no previous such instance did a president invoke extraordinary powers as an end run around lawmakers after failing to win legislative approval for a proposal The lawsuit was authorized by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group  which consists of the top leaders of both parties in the House  Ms  Pelosi  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the majority leader  Representative James E  Clyburn of South Carolina  the majority whip  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader  and Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana  the minority whip The group met briefly on Thursday and voted along party lines to authorize the lawsuit  It is unclear when it will be filed Legal action has been an option for House lawmakers since Mr  Trump declared a national emergency at the southwestern border in February to activate the power to redirect military construction funds  effectively trying to go around Congress s refusal to fund a border wall at the level he had demanded  Both chambers passed legislation that would have ended the national emergency  but Mr  Trump vetoed the bill   the first veto of his presidency   and the House could not muster enough votes to override it On Thursday  a Pentagon spokesman said that final decisions about what military construction projects would have their funds repurposed for his declaration have not yet been made The House will be joining several other lawsuits already filed  Plaintiffs in another suit challenging Mr  Trump s border barrier plans sought on Thursday to expedite obtaining a judicial order to block the government from taking further steps toward building new border barriers   even as administration officials raced to spend what money they had as quickly as they could The plaintiffs   the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition  which are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union   filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would bar the administration from building new barriers near Yuma  Ariz   and El Paso until the litigation can be resolved on the merits  Last month  the Trump administration had identified those sectors as locations for new or replacement barrier projects  while redirecting  1 billion in excess military pay and pension funds for that purpose That part of Mr  Trump s plans relies not on his high profile invocation of emergency powers  but on another component that has received less attention  using the Pentagon s separate authority to redirect some of its annual budget in order to beef up its counternarcotics programs  which in turn can be tapped for blocking smuggling along the border  Because that money must be spent before the fiscal year ends on Sept  30  the administration is trying to move quickly to issue contracts But the A C L U  says that its clients are likely to prevail in their argument that it is unlawful for Mr  Trump to use such tactics to spend more on border barriers than Congress appropriated  Its motion maintains that freezing any further steps toward construction before a final ruling   even as the clock continues to tick toward the end of September   would be justified because any such construction would  among other things   disrupt these ecosystems and cause irreversible damage  That case is pending before a Federal District Court judge in Oakland  Calif   Haywood S  Gilliam Jr   who was appointed in 2014 by President Barack Obama  The plaintiffs have asked him to hold a hearing on the request on May 9  

To the Editor Re  Migrants Pour Into a System That s  on Fire    front page  April 11  The challenges at our border are manageable and are caused neither by court rulings nor by  loopholes   as your article suggests  The Trump administration chose cruel and illegal responses to a regional refugee and displacement crisis  stoking chaos rather than pursuing effective solutions Instead  it could have led a regional initiative to resolve the crisis and expand refugee hosting capacity across the region  something a future administration must do  To sharply reduce numbers fleeing to its border  the United States must counter the problems involved in pushing people to leave and work with other countries so more refugees can be received and protected in the region To manage our border  the Department of Homeland Security should restore orderly asylum processing at points of entry rather than encouraging crossings between points  And it must start a case management program to facilitate hearing appearances rather than pushing more detention for families with children  To ensure fair  timely and effective decision making  the immigration courts should be made independent  protected from political influence and fully staffed Eleanor AcerNew YorkThe writer is senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First To the Editor Re  A  Full  Nation in Dire Need of New Faces   news analysis  front page  April 10  I had the privilege of driving across the United States several times when my younger daughter was attending college in Colorado  What struck me  along with the beauty of this vast and diverse country  was the amount of empty space  I often remarked that we have so much room  and so much latent capacity  to absorb refugees and immigrants at a level that far outpaces our current rate  It saddens me that the Trump administration is so miserly in its thinking and actions  We have more than enough  We can welcome so many more people and families who are yearning to make a new life for themselves and contribute to our society  Given that we ve all come from someplace else  except for Native Americans   we have a moral obligation to share the bounty we have all been offered  America is blessed with ample space and resources  It would be a great shame if we turned our backs on would be fellow citizens  and we would all be poorer as a result Joanne HeymanHastings on Hudson  N Y  

WASHINGTON   The Treasury Department on Friday targeted four companies and nine ships  including some that transported oil from Venezuela to Cuba  as part of the Trump administration s ongoing efforts to isolate President Nicolas Maduro So far  the U S  has revoked the visas of 718 of Maduro s associates and has issued sanctions on more than 150 people and entities  We continue to target companies that transport Venezuelan oil to Cuba  as they are profiting while the Maduro regime pillages natural resources   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement   Venezuela s oil belongs to the Venezuelan people  and should not be used as a bargaining tool to prop up dictators and prolong oppression  Despite the sanctions  Maduro clings to power with help from Russia  China and Cuba  The international coalition that supports the opposition stands at 54 nations  although some longtime U S  allies have refused to join the Trump administration in recognizing the head of the National Assembly  Juan Guaido  as interim president The companies sanctioned were Jennifer Navigation Limited  Lima Shipping Corp  and Large Range Limited  all based in Monrovia  Liberia  and three of their vessels suspected of delivering oil products from Venezuela to Cuba this year  In addition  Treasury sanctioned PB Tankers S P A   based in Italy  and six of its oil and storage tankers  including one that also delivered Venezuelan petroleum products to Cuba  

It may take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the southern United States border  the government said in court documents filed on Friday A federal judge had asked for a plan to identify these children and their families after a report from government inspectors in January revealed that the Trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents than was previously believed These families were separated before the administration unveiled its  zero tolerance  immigration policy in the spring of 2018  when nearly all adults entering the country illegally were prosecuted and any children accompanying them were put into shelters or foster care To identify these families  the government said it would apply a statistical analysis to about 47 000 children who were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and subsequently discharged  according to the court filing  From there  the government said it would manually review the case records of the children who appeared to have the highest probability of being part of the separated families Officials estimated that the process would take at least one year and potentially two  In explaining the reason for such an arduous process  the government said United States Customs and Border Protection did not collect specific data on migrant family separations before April 2018 Lawyers representing the Office of Refugee Resettlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday In a court filing for the government  Jonathan White  a commander with the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps  wrote that identifying this group of children presented new challenges because they were already discharged from the Office of Refugee Resettlement  meaning the government  lacks access  to them The statistical analysis was required because manually reviewing the cases of nearly 50 000 children would  overwhelm  the office s resources  he wrote The government s proposed plan arose from a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California  In June  Judge Dana M  Sabraw ordered the reunification of children and parents who had been separated under the Trump administration policy  President Trump rescinded the policy that same month ImageRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee  Democrat of Texas  speaking on Capitol Hill in February about the Trump administration s separation policy involving migrant families CreditJose Luis Magana Associated PressAbout 2 800 children have been reunified with their families or situated according to their parents  wishes  said Lee Gelernt  who challenged the policy in court on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union The January report  by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services  revealed that a group of separated families was unaccounted for because the government lacked an effective tracking system  In March  Judge Sabraw ruled that those families should be included in the litigation Mr  Gelernt said this identification process should take months  not years   If the government believed finding these children was a priority  they could do it quicker than two years   Mr  Gelernt said The families the government may now be tasked with locating are those who entered the United States on or after July 1  2017  the earliest known date that families were separated  were detained by immigration officials  and have a child who was detained and then released to a sponsor  such as a relative  before the judge s reunification order on June 26  2018 When the government previously identified children for reunification  it included only the children who were detained at the time of the reunification order Judge Sabraw wrote in his March 8 order that because all of these families had been subjected to the same policies and had been separated under  questionable circumstances   they should have the same opportunity for relief  Although identifying the families may be burdensome  as the government argued   it clearly can be done   the judge wrote According to the government s proposed plan  officials would update the A C L U  about the families  information after completing the analysis and reviewing the children s cases  The organization would then use that information to help reunify parents and children Mr  Gelernt said a two year wait to reunite families would be devastating  The longer these children remained separated from their families  he said  the more psychological trauma they would endure  He said the A C L U  planned to argue against the proposed plan in court The family separations were a central part of the Trump administration s effort to deter migrant families from trying to enter the United States through its southern border with Mexico Data released last month suggested that the administration s immigration measures   including the separation policy and attempts to beef up border security and limit who qualified for asylum   failed to deter tens of thousands of migrants traveling to the United States  most of whom were escaping violence and poverty in Central America  

WASHINGTON   Republican U S  Senator Lindsey Graham flatly rejected on Tuesday President Donald Trump s request to slash the budget for the U S  State Department by more than 23 percent That proposal  ain t happening   Graham  chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the State Department  declared at the opening of the hearing with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Senator Patrick Leahy  the top subcommittee Democrat  said the administration has proposed  damaging funding cuts  with little to no logical explanation  The Trump administration requested about  40 billion to fund the State Department and its aid arm  the United States Agency for International Development  for the fiscal year starting in October Pompeo noted the hearing comes days before his first anniversary as Trump s second secretary of state  Graham joked that Pompeo was the longest serving member of Trump s cabinet  referring to the high turnover of senior level staff at the White House Pompeo smiled but did not reply  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stepped down this week in the latest high profile resignation  and Trump said on Monday he would replace the head of the U S  Secret Service Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives have also said they will reject the proposed cuts to the budget  setting the stage for a budget battle with the White House   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Lesley Wroughton in Washington  Editing by James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump knew WikiLeaks until he didn t With his government seeking to prosecute WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  Trump is drawing a blank on a hacking organization he praised to the rafters during the 2016 campaign because of the discomfort it caused his Democratic opponent  Hillary Clinton It was among a number of factual faux pas and flips in his rhetoric over the past week A few months after asserting a need for legal immigrants  Trump declared the country  full  and he also seemed to change the grounds upon which he is refusing to release his taxes  It s not because he can t  but because he doesn t want to And with the release of more of the special counsel s report imminent  Trump kept up his refrain that Robert Mueller exonerated him despite Mueller s explicit statement that he did not A review WIKILEAKSTRUMP  asked if he still  loves  WikiLeaks   I know nothing about WikiLeaks  It s not my thing     remarks Thursday with South Korea s president THE FACTS  WikiLeaks was very much Trump s thing in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign  when candidate Trump showered praise on the anti secrecy organization night after night On the same October day that the  Access Hollywood  tape emerged  revealing that Trump had bragged in 2005 about groping women  WikiLeaks began releasing damaging emails from Clinton s campaign manager  John Podesta  Trump and his allies seized on the dumps and weaponized them  WikiLeaks  I love WikiLeaks   Trump said in Pennsylvania  This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove   Trump said in Michigan  Boy  I love reading WikiLeaks   Trump said in Ohio All told  Trump extolled WikiLeaks more than 100 times  and a poster of Assange hung backstage at the Republican s debate war room  At no point from a rally stage did Trump express any misgivings about how WikiLeaks obtained the emails from the Clinton campaign or about the accusations of stealing sensitive U S  government information  which led to the charges against Assange on Thursday  The U S  is seeking Assange s extradition from Britain    TAX RETURNSTRUMP   As you know  I got elected last time with this same issue      I would love to give them  but I m not going to do it while I m under audit     remarks Wednesday to reporters at the White House THE FACTS  Nothing s preventing Trump from releasing his tax returns Being under audit is no legal bar to anyone releasing his or her returns Asked repeatedly at a House hearing Tuesday whether any regulation prohibited a taxpayer from disclosing returns when under audit  IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig responded  no  Trump declined to provide his tax information as a candidate in 2016 and as president  something party nominees have traditionally done in the name of the transparency  By withholding his tax returns  Trump has not followed the standard followed by presidents since Richard Nixon started the practice in 1969  During the campaign  Trump said he wanted to release his returns but because he was under a routine audit   I can t  After the November midterm elections  Trump claimed at a news conference that the filings are too complex for people to understand    JOB APPROVALTRUMP  tweeting a Fox Business Network graphic showing his  soaring approval  at 55  overall   Great news   MAGA    tweet Thursday THE FACTS  The graphic on the Georgetown University poll was incorrect  The poll found 55  disapproval of Trump s performance  not approval  Fox Business issued an on air correction but Trump s tweet remains    CLIMATE CHANGETRUMP   We withdrew the United States from the one sided Paris climate accord  where you don t do any more drilling for oil and gas  That was going to cost us a lot of money  No more oil and gas with the Paris accord  That s good for Paris  but that s not good for us  Right     remarks Wednesday at a ceremony for the signing of executive orders meant to accelerate pipeline construction THE FACTS  Wrong  The Paris accord does not ban any form of energy development  It does not impose emission caps on signatory countries  The accord is a set of voluntary targets determined by individual nations    RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONTRUMP   I ve been totally exonerated  No collusion  No obstruction     remarks Wednesday at the White House TRUMP   I m not concerned about anything  because frankly there was no collusion and there was no obstruction     remarks Thursday with South Korea s president THE FACTS  Attorney General William Barr s four page summary of Mueller s nearly 400 page report did not  totally  exonerate Trump  Mueller specifically states in the report  as quoted by Barr   While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  The summary of principal conclusions by Barr notes Mueller did not  draw a conclusion   one way or the other   as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction   but rather set out evidence for both sides  leaving the question unanswered of whether Trump obstructed justice  Barr said ultimately he decided as attorney general that the evidence developed by Mueller was  not sufficient  to establish  for the purposes of prosecution  that Trump committed obstruction In Senate testimony Wednesday  Barr acknowledged that Mueller did not ask him to draw a conclusion on the obstruction question  nor did he know whether Mueller agreed with him  Barr said he would be able to explain more fully after releasing a public version of Mueller s report in coming days    IMMIGRATIONTRUMP   Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States  or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and or institute Tariffs  Our Country is FULL     tweet Sunday THE FACTS  Despite the overwhelmed southern border  there s plenty of room in the United States  Dozens of countries have greater population density  It s only full in terms of the people Trump doesn t want His claim of a U S  with no vacancies for more immigrants is at odds with his own statement two months ago that encouraged  the largest  influx of legal immigrants ever  It also belies a U S  reality of aging baby boomers and falling birth rates  which make immigrants increasingly important to sustain a level of population growth for the U S  economy to keep expanding The nation s population growth is at its lowest since 1937  with the 18 and under population declining both nationally and in 29 states  according to William H  Frey of the Brookings Institution  Economists say that restricting immigration would probably weaken economic growth  A shrinking labor force could also harm the health and stability of safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare Trump himself seemed to acknowledge the realities during his State of the Union address in February  declaring   I want people to come into our country  in the largest numbers ever  but they have to come in legally   He s now describing a U S  bursting at the seams  unable to take any immigrants  including those seeking legal asylum Immigrants as a whole make up a greater percentage of the total U S  population than they did back in 1970  having grown from less than 5 percent of the population to more than 13 percent now  In 2030  it s projected that immigrants will become the primary driver for U S  population growth  overtaking U S  births    TRUMP on separating migrant children from their parents when caught crossing into the U S  illegally   I m the one that stopped it  President Obama had child separation     remarks to reporters Tuesday THE FACTS  No  he s the one who started it on a broad scale  He instituted a  zero tolerance  policy aimed at criminally prosecuting all adults caught crossing into the U S  illegally  That meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody  During the Obama administration and the early Trump administration  such family separations were the exception  They became the rule under his policy  He suspended the practice in June because of a public uproar    TRUMP on the family separations   President Obama had the law  We changed the law  and I think the press should accurately report it but of course they won t     remarks to reporters Tuesday THE FACTS  This is false  Trump did not achieve any change in the law Trump s zero tolerance policy was of his own making  His administration is operating under the same immigration laws as Obama s During the Obama administration and before Trump s zero tolerance policy was introduced  migrant families caught illegally entering the U S  were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings  not requiring separation  unless they were known to have a criminal record  Then and now  immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases  such as serious criminal charges against a parent  concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns    ENERGY and ENVIRONMENTTRUMP   We have the cleanest air and water  they say  in the world  We are the best    remarks Wednesday at the signing of orders on pipelines THE FACTS  Not true about air U S  drinking water is among the best by one leading measure Trump s own Environmental Protection Agency data show that in 2017  among 35 major U S  cities  there were 729 cases of  unhealthy days for ozone and fine particle pollution   That s up 22 percent from 2014 and the worst year since 2012  Findings for 2018 are incomplete The State of Global Air 2019 report by the Health Effects Institute rated the U S  as having the eighth cleanest air for particle pollution   which kills 85 000 Americans each year   behind Canada  Scandinavian countries and others The U S  ranks poorly on smog pollution  which kills 24 000 Americans per year  On a scale from the cleanest to the dirtiest  the U S  is at 123 out of 195 countries measured On water  Yale University s global Environmental Performance Index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water  the U S  among them  On environmental quality overall  the U S  was 27th  behind a variety of European countries  Canada  Japan  Australia and more  Switzerland was No  1    TRUMP   With the help of the incredible workers in this room  the United States is now the No  1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world  anywhere on the planet  Not even close  Made a lot of progress in the last two and a half years  haven t we  Huh  Took down a lot of barriers     signing ceremony THE FACTS  As he s done many times before  Trump is crediting himself with things that happened under Obama Here s what the government s U S  Energy Information Administration says   The United States has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009  when U S  natural gas production surpassed that of Russia  and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013  when U S  production exceeded Saudi Arabia s  As for crude oil specifically  the information agency says the U S  became the world s top crude oil producer last year  That is largely attributed to the shale oil boom that began during the Obama administration  which has sent production from the Permian Basin in the southwest surging    TRUMP   Under this administration  we have ended the war on American energy like never before     signing ceremony THE FACTS  It wasn t much of a war  U S  petroleum and natural gas production has increased by nearly 60  since 2008  according to the Energy Information Administration  achieving pre eminence during the Obama administration  That said  the Trump administration is more closely aligned with fossil fuel interests as it works to restrain environmental obstacles and the power of states to stand in the way of pipelines and other energy development    Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire  Ellen Knickmeyer  Seth Borenstein and Mary Clare Jalonick

WASHINGTON   In recent months  Kirstjen Nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  had become a regular presence eating dinner at the Trump International Hotel  She had been heckled and booed when dining out after becoming the face of some of President Trump s most hard line immigration policies  like family separations  and her affinity for the hotel  a gathering place for the president s supporters  seemed like a sign that she felt safer on the inside But her status inside the White House  where she was subject to dressing downs from Mr  Trump during cabinet meetings and constant criticism by the president  was not much more secure So when Ms  Nielsen went to the White House on Sunday night to meet with the president to discuss some grievances  she was also prepared to avoid a messy end by letting Mr  Trump  who is known for not personally firing people  off the hook  After Mr  Trump made it clear that he was looking for a change  Ms  Nielsen told him she would resign  ridding him of a cabinet secretary who had long disappointed him Ms  Nielsen s departure  announced Sunday night  was abrupt but hardly unforeseen  the latest in a long and growing conga line of senior officials who have left the administration unceremoniously because of their own frustrations with the president  or because of the president s obvious disappointment in them  Usually  it is both Mr  Trump has ripped into Ms  Nielsen  holding her personally responsible for the uptick in crossings at the southwestern border  And Ms  Nielsen wanted to tell Mr  Trump that she was upset not to have been notified beforehand about his sudden withdrawal of Ron Vitiello  the nominee to serve as Immigration and Customs Enforcement director  and that she was frustrated at being pulled from security meetings in Europe last week and ordered to appear by the president s side on a trip to the border  according to someone close to Ms  Nielsen The end for Ms  Nielsen was something that has become familiar in the Trump administration  a high ranking official like Jeff Sessions  the former attorney general  or Rex Tillerson  the former secretary of state  leaving with a reputation in need of rehabilitation  Normally  people just resign   said Ronald A  Klain  who served as chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   The president sends word through an intermediary that he s unhappy  and you resign  The president says something nice about them and then they leave  But here  quitting isn t good enough  Some exits have been more humiliating than others  Since the departure of Mr  Tillerson  Mr  Trump has referred to him as  dumb as a rock  and  lazy as hell   After calling the departure of his defense secretary  Jim Mattis  a  retirement  and praising his service  Mr  Trump turned on him once he understood that the resignation was an affront to him   What s he done for me   Mr  Trump said of Mr  Mattis   How had he done in Afghanistan  Not too good  After years of haranguing Mr  Sessions in public and in private  Mr  Trump sent John F  Kelly  his former chief of staff  to demand his resignation in November  and he has not let up on him since he left office  In a speech in front of the Conservative Political Action Conference last month  Mr  Trump mimicked Mr  Sessions s southern accent while discussing his decision to recuse himself from the special counsel s investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 campaign ImageRex Tillerson  left  the former secretary of state  and Jeff Sessions  the former attorney general  were both forced out of their positions in the Trump administration CreditStephen Crowley The New York TimesMr  Kelly later suffered his own ignoble end  After he and Mr  Trump ironed out a departure plan at the end of last year  Mr  Kelly planned to make his own announcement at a senior staff dinner at the White House  But the president chose to break the news first  telling reporters that Mr  Kelly would be departing at the end of December Although all involved tried to put the best face on the Sunday meeting between Mr  Trump and Ms  Nielsen   someone familiar with it said the president had even asked her if she would want to return in another position   the two competed afterward for how to spin its contents Within minutes of the meeting s end  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter that Ms  Nielsen was  leaving her position   making it sound as if she was the latest cabinet secretary he had ousted online  Ms  Nielsen then posted her resignation letter on Twitter  notably leaving out any mention or praise for Mr  Trump Mr  Trump has yet to criticize her publicly since  But Ms  Nielsen has already absorbed more than her share of criticism for her role in implementing the president s policies Immigration and civil rights groups have been pressuring Fortune 500 companies to blacklist former Trump officials like Ms  Nielsen  who have promoted his immigration policies  writing that they  should not be allowed to seek refuge in your boardrooms or corner offices   Many other former administration officials have not experienced the post White House career bump that has become part of the payoff for putting in grueling hours on government salaries With a few exceptions  like the smooth send off for Nikki R  Haley  the former ambassador to the United Nations  and a glowing farewell to Linda McMahon  the former administrator of the Small Business Administration  Mr  Trump s top aides often find themselves damaged by their former boss in real time  or on delay Even those who have managed to stay in Mr  Trump s favor  like Mike Pompeo  the secretary of state  have a sense of gallows humor about what might ultimately befall them  I ll be there until he tweets me out of the office   Mr  Pompeo recently joked at an event in his home state of Kansas  when asked about his future in politics For her part  Ms  Nielsen appears to be intent on trying to minimize the damage to her reputation  with surrogates out defending her record  The so called immigration hard liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration  giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems   said Thad Bingel  who was a senior homeland security official in the Bush administration and served as an aide to Ms  Nielsen during her Senate confirmation  They apparently don t want anyone like a Secretary Nielsen or Secretary Kelly  who deals in reality  to tell them or the president any of this   

WASHINGTON   The White House said on Tuesday it would appeal a court ruling that halted a Trump administration policy requiring some asylum seekers to return to Mexico and wait for their legal cases to proceed U S  District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco said on Monday that the administration s policy of sending some Central American asylum seekers to Mexico while their claims work through a backlogged immigration court system was not authorized by U S  law and lacked safeguards to protect refugees from threats to their lives or freedom  This action gravely undermines the president s ability to address the crisis at the border with the tools Congress has authorized and disrupts the conduct of our foreign affairs   the White House said in a statement  We intend to appeal  and we will take all necessary action to defend the executive branch s lawful efforts to resolve the crisis at our southern border   it added The judge s ruling is scheduled to take effect on Friday  It was not immediately clear if the government would seek a suspension of the ruling while the appeals process runs its course A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment Federal agencies on the U S  Mexico border are trying to stem the rising numbers of immigrants  many of them families fleeing violence and poverty in Central America  The Department of Homeland Security said it arrested or denied entry to more than 103 000 people along the border last month  more than double the March 2018 figure   Reporting by Eric Beech  Makini Brice and Yeganeh Torbati  Editing by David Alexander and Grant McCool

WASHINGTON   Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  resigned on Sunday after meeting with President Trump  ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the border security agency that had made her the target of the president s criticism  I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside   Ms  Nielsen said in a resignation letter   I hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse  Ms  Nielsen had requested the meeting to plan  a way forward  at the border  in part thinking she could have a reasoned conversation with Mr  Trump about the role  according to three people familiar with the meeting  She came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president Mr  Trump in recent weeks had asked Ms  Nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers  which Ms  Nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate  While the 30 minute meeting was cordial  Mr  Trump was determined to ask for her resignation  After the meeting  she submitted it ImageListen to  The Daily   The Brief  Controversial Tenure of Kirstjen NielsenAs homeland security secretary  she enacted and publicly defended the family separation

Michael Barbaro  produced by Rachel Quester  Jessica Cheung and Eric Krupke  and edited by Paige CowettAs homeland security secretary  she enacted and publicly defended the family separation policy  In President Trump s eyes  she didn t go far enough michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  The secretary of homeland security was forced out of her job  even after carrying out and defending President Trump s most restrictive immigration policies  Why that wasn t enough  It s Tuesday  April 9  Caitlin  describe what happened over the weekend caitlin dickersonSo on Sunday  Kirstjen Nielsen  who s the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security   she s the nation s highest ranking immigration officer   she goes to the White House for an unscheduled meeting with President Trump michael barbaroCaitlin Dickerson covers immigration for The Times caitlin dickersonAnd he  in recent weeks  has been very riled up publicly over an increasing number of people crossing the border  especially families who seek asylum who have legal protections that mean they have to be allowed into the country  So the secretary arrives at her meeting with a list of ideas for how to address this problem  and she thinks she and the president are going to come up with a way forward  But instead  a few hours later  the president sends a tweet announcing that she will be leaving her job archived recording 1Breaking news here on CNN  From the White House  the secretary of homeland security  Kirstjen Nielsen  has resigned archived recording 2President Trump made the announcement via Twitter archived recording 3In a tweet  the president said  quote   Secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position  and I would like to thank her for her service  archived recording 4So it appears that the president is swinging the revolving door yet again  trying to install new people in his administration to carry out his bidding michael barbaroThat sounds like a meeting that went very poorly for the secretary caitlin dickersonClearly  they were not able to come up with a solution that both could agree on michael barbaroAnd by tweeting her resignation  I think what we re politely suggesting is that he fired her caitlin dickersonFired her  Yes  exactly michael barbaroSo what is the history between President Trump and Secretary Nielsen caitlin dickersonSo Secretary Nielsen takes her job at the end of 2017  She s replacing her former boss  John Kelly  who went to be President Trump s chief of staff  And she takes on this role as basically the person who has to approve any new policy that s going to be introduced along the border  And it s at this period of time when  I think  the President is settling into his role  He s fired up about really coming up with some hard evidence that he can point to ahead of the midterm elections  for example  and say  look  I m keeping my campaign promises  and I m lowering immigration really dramatically  So right away  she s faced with aggressive ideas for how to prevent people from coming to the United States  and the first one is family separation michael barbaroAnd what do we know about how Nielsen responds to that very controversial policy when it is first introduced to her caitlin dickersonShe slow walks it  We reported in December of 2017 that a family separation policy had reached her desk for that final signature  and it took her four months to approve it  during which time she and President Trump clashed quite a bit  She had questions about the legality of it  She had questions about the practicality and how the public was going to respond  And she had just a lot of reservations about moving forward  But ultimately  she agreed  and the policy was introduced in a formal way in April archived recording 1Quit separating the kids  They re separating the children  Mr  President  don t you have kids  Don t you have kids  Mr  President archived recording 2I don t believe in this  This is not America  This is not our country  This is not what we should be doing archived recording  kirstjen nielsen This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border archived recordingShame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay at the other side of the border  fearing death  and allow the secretary to come here and lie archived recording  kirstjen nielsen Calling me a liar are fighting words  I m not a liar  We ve never had a policy for family separation  And let s be clear   if an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States  they would go to jail  and they would be separated from their family  This is not a controversial idea caitlin dickersonInternally  she s  if not resisting  she s certainly questioning and slowing down a lot of these policies  And then  externally  to the public  she s having to defend them and really look like the face of them  and that ends up being something that she does actually over and over again in her job michael barbaroAnd remind us what ends up happening to the family separation policy caitlin dickersonSo President Trump stopped the practice himself by signing an executive order archived recording  donald trump I consider it to be a very important executive order  It s about keeping families together caitlin dickersonBut it didn t matter  because a few days later  a federal judge intervened  deemed the practice unconstitutional  and he didn t stop there  He said that  archived recordingFamilies who have been separated as a result of the Trump administration s zero tolerance policy be reunited within 30 days  The order says kids under 5 must be back with their parents within 14 days from now caitlin dickersonSo sort of a resounding disavowal of this policy michael barbaroBy the legal system caitlin dickersonExactly  And so even though she d pushed back against it  Secretary Nielsen ends up taking the blame michael barbaroSo what s another example something that she expresses internal qualms about but then goes out and defends publicly caitlin dickersonSo one of the next policies to be introduced was an idea to limit asylum pretty significantly so that people could only apply if they showed up at a legal port of entry   whereas beforehand  people could and did very often show up anywhere along the border  present themselves to a border agency  ask for protection  and they were ushered into this legal process  The idea was to say  you can t do that anymore  You have to show up at a specific office  which is  of course  a pretty tall order for somebody who s coming from Central America with maybe a cell phone  maybe not  not a whole lot of resources  They don t always know exactly where these offices exist archived recording  kirstjen nielsen You do not need to break the law of this country by entering illegally to claim asylum  If you are seeking asylum  go to a port of entry caitlin dickersonBut as Nielsen pointed out to the president  it was very hard to justify  because immigration law explicitly says that you can request asylum regardless of where you enter michael barbaroSo again  Nielsen is saying inside the White House  hey  this might not be legal  I have reservations about it  But it nevertheless gets implemented  And as you ve said  she s the decider  So she signs off on it caitlin dickersonExactly  And it s important to point out that when Nielsen pushed back against President Trump  it wasn t a reflection of her being a liberal on immigration or having a more sympathetic view toward asylum seekers  She just happened to be the face of an entire agency full of people who work in immigration enforcement but who still made clear to her that there were going to be legal and logistical roadblocks to putting these ideas into place michael barbaroAnd what happens to that port of entry policy that would limit the number of locations that people can apply for asylum caitlin dickersonVery quickly after  it s blocked by federal courts  and it remains that way archived recordingA district court ruled that the ban conflicts with immigration law caitlin dickersonSo this was the executive branch trying to very clearly contradict laws that were approved by the legislative branch archived recordingAnd now the Supreme Court has refused to step in to unblock the ban michael barbaroSo her legal reservations are well founded  In other words  her advice to the president is correct  even if it s ignored caitlin dickersonThat s right  Her analysis is sound  because each time she is pushed back  she s been right  And these ideas have been blocked michael barbaroDo any of these policies that we re describing   family separation  limiting the locations at which people can seek asylum   do any of them succeed in curbing the flow of migrants  even for the very short period of time that they re in place before they are legally challenged caitlin dickersonThey don t archived recordingNew numbers show a 400 percent   4 0 0  that is   400 percent increase over just last year caitlin dickersonLast October  we saw a record number of families seek asylum in the United States  This is after family separation is introduced  And every month since then  the numbers have gotten even higher archived recordingC B P  officials say Border Patrol agents are on pace for apprehensions and encounters with more than 100 000 migrants in March michael barbaroSo not only are these policies being blocked in court  for the very short bit of time that they were ever in place  they re not doing their job of limiting the flow of migrants caitlin dickersonThey re not  The numbers keep going up  And some people would argue that maybe the policies weren t left in place for long enough to show any concrete outcome  and we can t know that for sure  But what we do know is that these policies that Nielsen was pushing back on  saying they re not going to work  didn t work  And the numbers have continued to rise michael barbaroAnd so what does that do to the president s relationship to Nielsen  She s in a sense being vindicated  but the problem she s there to solve is only getting worse caitlin dickersonShe s simultaneously sort of being vindicated if you look at it from a legal standpoint  but from a relationship standpoint  she s the face  in President Trump s eyes  of these failures archived recording 1Kirstjen Nielsen appears to be on shaky ground  That s according to a New York Times report  Nielsen told colleagues that she was close to resigning Wednesday after being berated by the president in front of the entire cabinet archived recording 2Nothing sets him off more than immigration  and I m told that meeting on Wednesday in the cabinet room was very heated  was incredibly heated  She spoke back to him about it  tried to defend herself caitlin dickersonSo it s in this context of the policies that are being introduced being blocked in the courts  the number of people crossing the border rising  and Trump s relationship with Secretary Nielsen falling apart that he comes up with his most aggressive idea yet archived recordingAnother day  another threat from President Trump  and today  he is threatening to shut down the southern border caitlin dickersonWhere he wants to completely seal the border  100 percent  Not let anybody come into the U S archived recording  donald trump And if they don t stop them  we re closing the border  We ll close it  and we ll keep it closed for a long time  I m not playing games michael barbaroAnd how exactly would that work caitlin dickersonWell  we shouldn t assume that the president had any particular policy in his mind when he tweeted that he wanted to seal the border  We can assume  though  that he wasn t talking about  for example  cargo moving back and forth or people with actual visas and permission to come into the United States  but really that he s talking about shutting down asylum and shutting down the ability of people who don t previously have permission to come into the United States  And the policy that we know has come closest to achieving that goal  one that s been kicking around in Washington for some months now  would be to get rid of asylum as we know it  It would no longer allow anyone to apply for asylum in the United States  And instead  people who needed that status or wanted that status would have to stay in their home country  similar to the way that Syrian refugees apply to come to the United States   apply from home  wait many months  go through lots of vetting and background checks  and then only if they re approved  they would be allowed to come here michael barbaroAnd I guess  what could be a more extreme version of limiting asylum than literally telling people  you cannot come to this country and apply for asylum caitlin dickersonI don t think there is a more extreme version  because I think this idea means eliminating asylum  It goes away michael barbaroAnd as best we understand it  what was Secretary Nielsen s response to this idea caitlin dickersonFrom what we know  it s been very similar to the way she reacted to family separation  to that idea to significantly limit asylum to the ports of entry  which is that this is going to be challenged by the courts immediately  It s going to be a huge lift to get a policy like this introduced  to work out the logistics  and all of it will be for naught  because it ll be enjoined by the courts  And it s that oppositional and resistant stance that she s in when she walks into the White House for her meeting with the president  It s unclear who threw up their hands first or second  or whether they both did it  but what we know is that the president did not leave her with an option  that he  at least  decided this isn t going to work  You re out  And she was by the end of that night  And so what that means is the homeland security secretary who oversaw some of the most controversial and aggressive immigration policies this country has ever seen   even she wasn t aggressive enough for President Trump  And so now she s gone  and he s looking for a replacement who will go even further michael barbaroWe ll be right back  So Caitlin  who is the president turning to to replace Nielsen as he looks for somebody to go further than she was willing to go caitlin dickersonHe s turning to Kevin McAleenan  who s currently the head of United States Customs and Border Protection  That s the agency that oversees both the customs officers who you meet at the airport when you ve gone on vacation abroad and then the Border Patrol  Those are the police  the boots on the ground along the border  And McAleenan is known as sort of a policy wonk  a really smart and reasonable guy who s willing to work with Democrats  and somebody who served under President Obama as well  He s got more than 10 years of experience at the agency  People know him as this reasonable guy  But when you dig a little bit deeper  McAleenan was inspired to get into homeland security work right after 9 11  And at C B P   especially most recently when he was overseeing this agency  it really became known as the sort of policy engine with him at the center of it coming up with ways to turn President Trump s ideas into actual policies that could be carried out  If D H S  is this agency run out of Washington that s overseeing all of this work  it was McAleenan s staff members that were actually physically taking children away from their parents  that were physically turning asylum seekers away at the border or telling them to go elsewhere or to wait in line  So now he s moving into this role where he s got even more power  but I think we can expect that he ll continue to do what he was doing before  which was take President Trump s ideas that are sort of extreme and that aren t necessarily encumbered by the immigration laws  norms  history  and he ll try to translate them into something that s practical and that can be introduced on the ground michael barbaroSo even though he might seem moderate at first glance  he s actually someone who the president trusts to put these more restrictive  maybe even extreme policies into practice  And he s been involved in doing that already  Now he s being elevated to do it at an even higher level caitlin dickersonExactly michael barbaroAnd I guess that all makes sense  If Nielsen is seen as too reluctant to put these policies into practice  then the president would turn to somebody who is willing to do that caitlin dickersonThat s right  who is willing to try  But remember that McAleenan is going to run up against the exact same legal framework and logistical challenges that anybody else in that role is going to michael barbaroRight  So if these policies are going to run into legal trouble in the courts  regardless of who is leading the agency  what does it matter  in the end  if the leader of the Department of Homeland Security is gung ho about the President s policies or is reluctantly saying yes  as Nielsen was caitlin dickersonI think you can look at that question a couple of different ways  On one hand  you re right that it s not going to make a huge difference who s sitting in the office at the head of the Homeland Security Department  because no matter what they introduce  if it violates the immigration law  they re going to wind up in court  But another way of looking at it is family separation only existed as an official sort of policy for what  45 days under zero tolerance  Not a very long period of time before it had to end  But still  I don t think that very many people are going to argue that family separation was a small thing or something that didn t affect very many people  I mean  I think it had a huge impact  So I do think that if you have a hawk running the Homeland Security Department  even when they re sort of encumbered by the existing legal framework  they can make some pretty big changes  even if  ultimately  those changes wind up in court  I think that Kevin McAleenan has two things going for him in President Trump s eyes  The first  like we said  is that he knows the policies and he knows the situation on the ground like the back of his hand  And the second thing is that he s shown a willingness to follow President Trump s lead  and so he may be the person who s best positioned to come up with the most legal ways to achieve President Trump s goals  And even if the policies that he comes up with don t remain in place in the long term  they might at least exist long enough to give President Trump something to point to and show his supporters when they ask  where are you on these campaign promises  Where are you on this idea of  if not sealing the border  significantly decreasing the number of immigrants coming to the United States michael barbaroSo even if these policies are ultimately blocked by the courts  it feels like it s important to this president to have someone at the Department of Homeland Security who is willing to try them  and that may be enough caitlin dickersonI think in President Trump s heart of hearts  right  he would hope that he would find not only somebody who is willing to try but somebody who is going to succeed  He wants aggressive policies to be instituted in the long term  But I think it s better in his mind than nothing to have somebody who s willing to try  And as we know  politically  it s better than nothing  because then the president can point to these policies that he tried to introduce  if only it wasn t for the courts who had blocked him  or if only it wasn t for Congress who blocked him michael barbaroRight  My intention was there  Somebody else is at fault for it not working caitlin dickersonExactly  He has at least an attempt to meet these campaign promises to point to when voters ask  why haven t you made a significant change  So I think that having a more aggressive leader in place who s more willing to introduce these policies  when they get stuck in the courts  it allows Trump to blame the courts rather than his own administration for getting in his way  He can say  look  I tried  but these judges are blocking me  whereas it wasn t just the judges blocking him with Secretary Nielsen  It was her  too michael barbaroIf Congress is not going to change the law  and I think the assumption is that they are not going to do that anytime soon when it comes to basic immigration law  is the president right to suggest that the current system is broken  and the only way to fix it is to test these new ideas  even if they push the boundaries of the law caitlin dickersonI would say yes to the first part of your question  Most people agree that the system is broken  But when it comes to fixing the problem  what are you trying to fix  In the president s mind  the problem is the vast number of people coming here to seek asylum  His idea of a fix would decrease that number  But other people see the problem as not that people are coming here to seek asylum at all but the ways that we re dealing with them  We don t have space to place people physically in custody when they enter  We don t have judges to hear their cases for years and years  So if you see that as the problem  then  michael barbaroHe s not really addressing those caitlin dickersonHe s not addressing those problems  and I think that s because a lot of people who agree with the president are concerned that if we come up with better systems for processing asylum seekers   we make it more organized and efficient and  in some cases  comfortable   that all that will do is encourage more and more people to come  And again  if the numbers themselves are what you see as the problem  then making the system better only makes it worse michael barbaroCaitlin  what does all of this tell us about where President Trump plans to go on immigration caitlin dickersonI think it shows that President Trump is going to continue full steam ahead to achieve his immigration goals and that if there are people  even informed career officials  who want to stand in the way of that  they re going to be pushed out  because he s very committed to the goal of limiting the number of people who come to the border  regardless of the many legal challenges he s already faced  those that are sure to come  the public reaction  all these other things notwithstanding  We re not seeing any signs of slowing down  I think this week is actually an indicator of a ramping up of these goals michael barbaroIn other words  the gloves are coming off  even though  in a lot of people s minds  they thought the gloves were already off caitlin dickersonThat s right  It s like another set of gloves are coming off michael barbaroCaitlin  thank you very much caitlin dickersonThank you michael barbaroOn Monday  The Times reported that President Trump plans to push out more officials from the Department of Homeland Security  including the department s general counsel and the director of U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  as he seeks to carry out his harder line approach to immigration  A few hours later  in the latest legal setback to that approach  a federal judge blocked a Trump administration policy that required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico rather than in the U S  while their cases made their way through U S  immigration court  The judge found that the policy violated federal law  Here s

designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  including its Quds Force  as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act michael barbaroOn Monday  the Trump administration said that it was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization  the first time that the U S  has classified part of any country s government as such a threat archived recording  mike pompeo We re doing it because the Iranian regime s use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government michael barbaroThe move was debated at the highest levels of the administration  with top officials at the Defense Department and the C I A  opposing the designation  arguing it could justify Iranian attacks against the U S  and its allies  But the president s national security adviser  John Bolton  and his secretary of state  Mike Pompeo  advocated for the decision  arguing the designation would further isolate Iran by discouraging businesses from working with its military archived recording  mike pompeo This historic step will deprive the world s leading state sponsor of

operations in the Middle East  as a terrorist organization as well  That s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow The move comes just two days after Mr  Trump  who has repeatedly expressed anger at a rise in migrants at the southwestern border  withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a  tougher  direction Mr  Trump

secretary through Wednesday  in order  to assist with an orderly transition   The abruptness was unusual because the Department of Homeland Security currently does not have a deputy secretary  who would normally take the reins The president said in a tweet that Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  would take over as the acting replacement for Ms  Nielsen  who became the sixth secretary to lead the agency in late 2017  But by law  the under secretary for management  Claire Grady  who is currently serving as acting deputy secretary  is next in line to be

home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country  including doing things that were clearly illegal  such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum  She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws  court settlements and international obligations Those responses only infuriated Mr  Trump further  The president s fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as Ms  Nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained In a cabinet meeting surrounded by her peers  Mr  Trump castigated her repeatedly  leading her to draft a resignation letter and to tell colleagues that there was no reason for her to lead the department any longer  By the end of the week  she had reconsidered and remained in her position  becoming an increasingly fierce supporter of his policies  including the family separations Mr  Trump and Stephen Miller  the president s top immigration adviser  have privately but regularly complained about Ms  Nielsen  Lou Dobbs  a Fox News host who is one of the president s favorite sounding boards  has also encouraged Mr  Trump s negative views of her handling of the migrant crisis Ms  Nielsen lost a powerful protector when Mr  Kelly  her mentor  left his job as White House chief of staff at the beginning of the year  Mr  Kelly was the Trump administration s first homeland security secretary and lobbied for Ms  Nielsen to replace him Multiple White House officials said she had grown deeply paranoid in recent months  after numerous stories about her job being on the line  She also had supported the Immigration and Customs Enforcement nominee Mr  Trump withdrew  Ronald D  Vitiello  and her support for him was described as problematic for her with the president  Mr  Trump felt Mr  Vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president threatened again to do in a tweet on Sunday night The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other In early 2019  as the number of migrant families from Central American countries surged  the president s fury at Ms  Nielsen did  too  He repeatedly demanded that she cut off foreign aid to Central American countries even though the funding was the responsibility of the State Department  She repeatedly deflected his demands One day after Ms  Nielsen traveled to Honduras to sign a regional compact with officials from Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  Mr  Trump cut State Department funding for the countries  And in recent days  the president made public moves to undercut her authority  leaking news that he might nominate an  immigration czar  to assume oversight of the issue at the heart of Ms  Nielsen s department Still  Ms  Nielsen embraced the president s  crisis  language as apprehensions of migrants at the border shot up to thousands per day  On Friday  Mr  Trump traveled with Ms  Nielsen and Mr  McAleenan to Calexico  Calif   to highlight the issue While the number of border crossings is not as high as in the early 2000s  the demographic of migrants has shifted largely from individual Mexicans looking for jobs   who could easily be deported   to Central American families  overwhelming detention facilities and prompting mass releases of migrants into cities along the border Ms  Nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100 000 migrants in March But despite the trip and several stories about how much better her relationship with Mr  Trump was  Ms  Nielsen never learned how to manage him  people familiar with their discussions said  He often felt lectured to by Ms  Nielsen  the people familiar with the discussions said ImageMs  Nielsen lost a powerful protector when John F  Kelly  her mentor and the Trump administration s first homeland security secretary  left his job as White House chief of staff at the beginning of the year CreditAl Drago for The New York TimesAnd his son in law  Jared Kushner  was not an admirer of Ms  Nielsen  several administration officials said  That came to a head recently as Mr  Kushner had inserted himself into immigration discussions While Mr  Trump often blamed Ms  Nielsen for the surge in migrant crossings  she will be remembered for leading the department during the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy along the southwestern border  which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families An intense backlash ensued  and the Department of Homeland Security was unprepared to deal with separating nearly 3 000 children from their parents  Hampered by misstep after misstep  Kirstjen Nielsen s tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start   said Representative Bennie Thompson  a Mississippi Democrat and the chairman of the House s committee on Homeland Security   It is clearer now than ever that the Trump administration s border security and immigration policies   that she enacted and helped craft   have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border  Mr  Trump eventually moved to halt the family separations  though the government struggled in some cases to reunite those it had already separated By naming Mr  McAleenan acting secretary  Mr  Trump is installing another veteran of previous administrations  not a loyal foot soldier of Mr  Trump s campaign Married to a Salvadoran immigrant  Mr  McAleenan is a lawyer who wrote an honors thesis at Amherst College on marriage equality and applied at the F B I  after the Sept  11 attacks Described by colleagues as a savvy political operator  Mr  McAleenan worked cooperatively with Obama administration officials but later embraced Mr  Trump s agenda  which included unshackling Border Patrol agents from restrictions that the previous administration had imposed Mr  McAleenan was also one of three Department of Homeland Security officials who had urged Ms  Nielsen to sign the memo authorizing the routine separation of migrant families at the border The department  which has a budget of more than  40 billion and more than 240 000 employees  is an amalgam of 22 government agencies that was created after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  It is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters At 46  Ms  Nielsen was the youngest person to lead the sprawling department  and an unlikely choice for the job In the months immediately after the Sept  11 attacks  she helped set up the Transportation Security Administration  now an agency within the department  She also worked as a special assistant to President George W  Bush on natural disaster response while serving on the White House Homeland Security Council When Mr  Trump moved Mr  Kelly to the White House in July 2017  Ms  Nielsen moved with him  As the principal deputy chief of staff  she enforced Mr  Kelly s attempts to regulate access to Mr  Trump in the Oval Office  including the president s schedule   irritating White House staff members  who complained she was uncompromising Mr  Kelly later backed Ms  Nielsen to succeed him at the Homeland Security Department  though she was criticized as too inexperienced for the job by Democrats and anti immigration groups  Mr  Trump  however  said she was  ready on Day 1   There will be no on the job training for Kirstjen   Mr  Trump said in October 2017  announcing her nomination for the post But by the following spring  Ms  Nielsen was telling associates she was miserable in the job

SAN DIEGO   A Trump administration regulation set to go into effect Friday bars transgender people from the military unless they  correct those deficiencies   a description the American Medical Association said Thursday is unfair and defies science   The AMA told The Associated Press on Thursday the policy and its wording mischaracterizes transgender people as having a  deficiency   It said it also objects to the Defense Department classifying the need to transition to another gender among  administratively disqualifying conditions  that include those the Pentagon has labeled as  congenital or developmental defects  The new regulation strips transgender troops of rights they only recently secured under the Obama administration to serve openly and receive care if they choose to transition to another gender The Defense Department said its use of the words  deficiencies  is military lingo for when an individual fails to meet standards to maintain a lethal force  It is not a reference to gender dysphoria  a condition of extreme distress from not identifying with one s biological gender  Lt  Col  Carla Gleason said The department says transgender people can serve if they remain in their biological sex  The only thing deficient is any medical science behind this decision   American Medical Association President Dr  Barbara L  McAneny said Decorated Army helicopter pilot Lindsey Muller was a plaintiff in one of four lawsuits that tried to block the policy from taking effect  But the final legal injunction was lifted in March  though new legal challenges are expected Muller said she and other transgender troops feel demoralized  Under our ethical standards  we can t say anything derogatory against the administration  while we are being presented in a disparaging and derogatory light   said Muller  37  who is based in Fort Carson  Colorado Troops like Muller  who began openly identifying as a woman in 2016  are worried they will be discharged  The administration says it will not boot current service members who transitioned before the Pentagon issued its directive  though the government has also said it retains the right to eliminate that protection Muller said the policy will cost the armed forces far more in terms of losing experienced personnel like herself and training replacements than any costs associated with specialized health care for trans servicemembers  She plans to retire from the military next year after serving 20 years Under the new policy  a service member can be discharged based on a diagnosis of gender dysphoria if he or she is  unable or unwilling to adhere to all applicable standards  including the standards associated with his or her biological sex  or seeks transition to another gender  It said the discharge should come after an individual  has been formally counseled on his or her failure to adhere to such standards and has been given an opportunity to correct those deficiencies  The policy calls for troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria to be medically evaluated before discharging them to see if they qualify as having a disability  Otherwise gender dysphoria can be considered a  condition that interferes with military service  like sleep walking  bed wetting  motion sickness  and personality disorders  They can dress it up in whatever words they want  but when you carefully look at this it s total disrespect for these human beings by saying a core piece of them is not acceptable   former acting U S  Army Surgeon General Gale Pollock said Pollock signed a statement with three former U S  surgeons general and two former military surgeons general  saying they are  troubled by the Defense Department s characterization of the need to undergo gender transition as a  deficiency   and by the addition of gender dysphoria to official lists of  congenital or developmental defects  that include bed wetting and  disturbances of perception  thinking  emotional control  or behavior   An estimated 14 700 troops identify as transgender Military chiefs testified before Congress last year that they found no problems with transgender troops on morale or unit cohesion  Many have received medals since the armed forces welcomed them in 2016 Transgender troops say the regulation mirrors the  don t ask  don t tell  policy that prohibited gay men and women from serving openly in the armed forces before Congress repealed it in 2010      Crary reported from New York

A Democratic House chairman on Saturday castigated the Treasury Department for failing to meet his deadline to furnish President Trump s tax returns  arguing that the administration s apparent concerns over his use of powers outlined in the Internal Revenue Service s tax code  lack merit  The chairman  Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  set a new deadline for compliance  April 23  and warned that if the Trump administration did not reply by then  its  failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request  The tone of Mr  Neal s letter suggested Democrats are prepared to take their request   made through a little known provision in the federal tax code   to court if necessary  initiating what could be a protracted legal fight over Congress s oversight powers  In it  he cited legal precedent that he argued clearly showed the law is on the committee s side  and said that the executive branch had no right to  second guess  its motivations  Read the letter here   I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding my request and the authority of the committee   Mr  Neal wrote   Those concerns lack merit  Moreover  judicial precedent commands that none of the concerns raised can legitimately be used to deny the committee s request  The Treasury secretary  Steven Mnuchin  said on Saturday that he had read Mr  Neal s letter but made no commitments about complying with the request by the new deadline  which he described as  arbitrary   I feel a responsibility that we get this right and that the I R S  doesn t become weaponized like it was under the Nixon administration   Mr  Mnuchin said during a news briefing on the sidelines of the annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Mr  Mnuchin said that Treasury lawyers were studying the lawfulness of the request with the Justice Department  While he said that he would follow the law  he made clear that he had serious concerns about protecting the privacy of the tax returns of all taxpayers  including Mr  Trump  Related  How Kamala Harris s tax returns compare to those of other 2020 candidates    I don t think these are simple issues   Mr  Mnuchin said   They are constitutional issues  House Democrats  anticipating an increasingly likely legal fight over the Ways and Means action  have also taken steps to open a side door into Mr  Trump s finances  Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee  informed Republicans on Friday that he intended to issue a subpoena in the coming days to compel Mazars USA  an accounting company tied to the president  to turn over relevant financial records in its possession Republicans balked at the request  calling it an  astonishing abuse  of the committee s powers  But Mr  Cummings said he had the authority to investigate potential wrongdoing by Mr  Trump and testimony from Michael D  Cohen  his longtime fixer  that the president had intentionally misrepresented his assets and liabilities to suit his needs at a given moment  The committee has full authority to investigate whether the president may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office  to determine whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions  to assess whether he is complying with the emoluments clauses of the Constitution  and to review whether he has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities   Mr  Cummings wrote  hinting at the broad scope of his own investigation This month  Mr  Neal formally requested six years of Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns  ending months of speculation about when newly empowered Democrats would make a request and how they would justify it ImageMr  Trump has defied modern political norms and refused to release any of his tax returns CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesMr  Trump himself has made abundantly clear he does not intend to relent on his yearslong objections to turning over his tax returns  and his personal lawyer has urged the Treasury Department to fight Mr  Neal s request On Wednesday  just before Mr  Neal s initial deadline for compliance  the Treasury Department said it needed more time to assess the legality of the request but cast doubt on his assertions to having a legitimate legislative purpose to do so  Mr  Mnuchin wrote that he was consulting the Justice Department to draft a response  but did not indicate how long that would take  The committee s request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional investigative authority  the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose and the constitutional rights of American citizens   Mr  Mnuchin wrote   The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically motivated disclosures of tax information  regardless of which party is in power  Mr  Trump has defied modern political norms and refused to release any of his tax returns  either as a candidate or as president  He has repeatedly claimed  including as recently as Wednesday  that he is under audit by the I R S  and therefore cannot make the documents public as every other presidential nominee has done for decades But no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing returns while under audit  and the I R S  automatically audits the returns of all presidents and vice presidents while they are in office Mr  Neal says it is a committee investigation of that mandatory presidential audit policy that necessitates seeing Mr  Trump s returns Mr  Neal is relying on a little known provision in the federal tax code  Section 6103  that dates to the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s and gives the chairmen of Congress s tax writing committees unique powers to request tax information on any filer  The code itself gives the executive branch little wiggle room in responding  stating only that the Treasury secretary  shall  furnish the information upon request Legal scholars who have studied the provision and Mr  Neal s request believe that if the Treasury Department does object  it will argue that the Ways and Means chairman has overstepped Congress s oversight authority by making a request that lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and is meant only to achieve a political end  A resulting legal fight could ultimately make it to the Supreme Court and have significant implications on the expansiveness of Congress s investigative powers Republicans on Capitol Hill  Mr  Trump s White House aides  and his personal lawyer  William S  Consovoy  have all argued that Democrats are merely out to politically embarrass the president and urged the I R S  and Treasury Department to reject their request as illegitimate Mr  Neal s letter on Saturday punched back at some of their objections  Notably  it was addressed not to Mr  Mnuchin but to Charles P  Rettig  the I R S  commissioner  whom Democrats believe should make the decision himself At the news briefing on Saturday  Mr  Mnuchin defended his decision to oversee the request  noting that the Treasury Department supervises the tax collection agency Mr  Neal argued that the statute in question was clear that Mr  Rettig must hand over the information  But he added that the administration had no authority to question how the committee would handle the information or the validity of its legislative purpose  There is no valid basis to question the legitimacy of the committee s legislative purpose here   Mr  Neal wrote  citing a 1957 Supreme Court case  Watkins v  United States  as saying Congress s investigative powers were  broad  and  encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes  But legal scholars say that the administration could seek to cite the same 1957 ruling against the committee  because it also holds that while the powers of Congress to investigate are  broad   they are also  not unlimited

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump said Friday he is strongly considering releasing  Illegal Immigrants  into Democratic strongholds to punish congressional foes for inaction on the border  just hours after White House and Homeland Security officials insisted the idea had been rejected as fast as it had been proposed  Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws  we are indeed  as reported  giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only   Trump tweeted  He added that   The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders  Open Arms policy   so this should make them very happy  The reversal  which appeared to catch officials at the Department of Homeland Security off guard  came as critics were blasting Trump for the supposedly rejected idea  accusing him of turning migrants into pawns to go after his political opponents  It comes as Trump has grown increasingly exasperated by a surge of Central American migrant families crossing the southern border and is looking for new ways to pressure congressional Democrats to change laws that he insists are making the problem worse Indeed  last week Trump urged his soon to be acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan to seal the southern border and told McAleenan he would pardon him if he were to find himself in trouble for blocking legal asylum seekers  according to two people familiar with the conversation who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private exchange It was not clear whether the president was joking  and a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement   At no time has the president indicated  asked  directed or pressured the acting secretary to do anything illegal    The reported conversation came during the president s trip last week to Calexico  California  a day after he announced he was delaying his threat to close the border because Mexico appeared to be stepping up its enforcement efforts Before Trump s tweets on Friday  both the Department of Homeland Security and a White House official had released nearly identical statements saying the sanctuary cities plan had been floated but then flatly rejected But not  apparently  by the president  who emphatically revived the idea Asked about it by reporters  he said he was  strongly looking at  releasing migrant families into those communities  They re always saying they have open arms  Let s see if they have open arms   he said There were no indications  however  that officials were taking any steps to move forward with the idea or considered the president s words anything more than bluster  Sanctuary cities  are places where local authorities do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials  denying information or resources that would help ICE round up for deportation people living in the country illegally They include New York City and San Francisco  home city of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who on Friday called the idea  unworthy of the presidency of the United States and disrespectful of the challenges that we face as a country  as a people  to address who we are   a nation of immigrants  Rep  Bennie Thompson of Mississippi  who chairs the House Homeland Security committee  said it  serves as a reminder that the Trump administration s reckless immigration agenda is not about keeping the country safe  but about partisan politics and wantonly inflicting cruelty   The idea of pressing immigration authorities to embrace the plan was discussed in November and then again in February as the Trump administration struggled with a surge of migrants at the border  according to three people who spoke on condition of anonymity to outline private conversations  Homeland Security and ICE lawyers quickly rejected the proposal  according to the people  on the grounds that it was complicated  too expensive and a misuse of funds  two of the people said The plan  which was first reported by The Washington Post  is one of a litany of ideas being tossed around by an increasingly anxious White House in recent months  Officials say they are running out of options  and have proposed and recycled numerous ideas that have never come to fruition  Trump in recent weeks  for instance  has discussed the idea of renewing his administration s controversial family separation policy   even as he s publicly declared he won t do that   and has threatened to completely seal the border despite opposition from many in his administration There have been at least two versions of the sanctuary city plan discussed  One to move people who have already been detained to places with Democratic opponents of the president  the other to transport migrants apprehended at the border directly to San Francisco  New York City  Chicago and other spots ICE arrests people in the U S  illegally and also manages migrants who present themselves at border crossings and ask for asylum The surge of migrant families at the border has been taxing the system  and ICE says it no longer has the resources to handle immigrants processed by the Border Patrol  As a result  more than 125 000 people have been released as they await court hearings   a practice Trump has derided as  catch and release  With immigrant processing and holding centers overwhelmed  the administration has already been busing people hundreds of miles inland and releasing them at Greyhound stations and churches in cities such as Albuquerque  San Antonio and Phoenix Transporting large groups of immigrants to distant cities would be even more expensive for an agency already strapped for cash  Flights chartered by ICE cost about  7 785 per flight hour  according to the agency  and require multiple staffers  including an in flight medical professional  The agency also uses commercial flights but requires that migrants to pay for those At the same time  many  sanctuary  communities would likely welcome the immigrants in question  Some of these cities have robust networks of nonprofit legal groups that could help them strengthen their legal cases to stay The Department of Health and Human Services said this week it had started scouting vacant properties that could be turned into facilities for holding migrant children in several cities  including Atlanta  Dallas  Houston  Phoenix  and San Antonio Those facilities would be licensed by each state and likely take several months to be approved and opened  separating them from the rapidly expanding emergency shelter at Homestead  Florida  and the now closed tent facility at Tornillo  Texas The Defense Department has also been reviewing a number of military bases to find a location that can house up to 5 000 unaccompanied migrant children as the U S  braces for a surge of people crossing the U S  Mexico border this spring Under the Trump administration  ICE has significantly stepped up arrests  including of people who have no U S  criminal records  In response  some cities have banished ICE from jails where agents could easily pick up immigration violators  Police in New York  Baltimore and Seattle rarely  if ever  disclose information about when suspected criminals in the U S  illegally will be released from custody Democrats have said they will tackle immigration bills  possibly as soon as they return from their spring recess  and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has indicated an interest    Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant in Houston  Astrid Galvan in Phoenix and Lisa Mascaro and Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed to this

HAVANA   Cuban President Miguel Diaz Canel accused the Trump administration on Saturday of dragging relations with the United States to their worst level in decades and called on Cubans to strengthen the Communist run country s defenses and economy Diaz Canel  in a speech closing the National Assembly  said the United States is engaging in an  asphyxiating financial persecution that makes the import of goods and resources of primary necessity particularly difficult  The Cuban economy has stagnated in recent years in tandem with the implosion of strategic ally Venezuela  resulting in cuts in fuel and energy use by state entities and this year shortages of basic goods such as bread  chicken and eggs An increase in U S  sanctions under President Donald Trump is also making it even harder for cash strapped Cuba to get credit from financial institutions Cuba s Economy Minister Alejandro Gil Fernandez earlier in the day called on the government to tighten belts further and seek alternatives to imports  as foreign exchange earnings decline and credit for supplies and investment become more difficult to find  Exports are not growing as planned  The levels of foreign investment that the economy demands are not materializing   Gil said   We can forecast the import plan will not be fulfilled because the credits we need cannot be finalized due to the arrears of payments of debts  Cuba relies on imports directly or indirectly for much of what it produces and consumes  including fuel and food  and purchases the supplies with foreign currency it earns from exports and obtains through credits The government has been struggling to keep economic growth in the black and forecast a 1 5 percent increase in gross domestic product this year after a 1 2 percent increase last year The Trump administration has said Cuba is responsible for the survival of socialist Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro and slapped new sanctions on Cuba  which is already under a crippling trade embargo  leaving the detente of former president Barack Obama in the dust This month the United States sanctioned vessels and companies that ship oil to Cuba from Venezuela in exchange for health and other technical services  threatening the energy grid and transportation The Trump administration says it soon may activate a long dormant law under which Cuban Americans could sue foreign companies that profit from their properties nationalized during the first years of the 1959 Revolution  Our response is no  imperialist gentlemen  we Cubans do not surrender   Diaz Canel said on Saturday  adding the situation meant  we have two absolute priorities  the preparation of our defense and the economic battle at the same time  According to western diplomats and businessmen  Cuba has failed to pay suppliers on time for a number of years  piling up around  1 5 billion in short term debt Trade fell around 25 percent from 2013 through 2017 and declined again last year  according to the government In addition to the Venezuelan crisis  the advent of a far right government in Brazil led last year to the scrapping of a doctors for cash deal valued at an annual  300 million   Reporting by Marc Frank  additional reporting by Nelson Acosta  editing by Grant McCool  

JERUSALEM   When will the  deal of the century   as President Trump has called his forthcoming plan for Israeli Palestinian peace  finally be unveiled Certainly not before April 9  when Israel holds its next election  But how soon after   In less than 20 years   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo noncommittally told a congressional committee recently In any case  American peace plans are nothing new  Does anyone recall  for instance  the Rogers Plans  named after Secretary of State William P  Rogers  who served under President Richard Nixon 50 years ago  When the second of his plans was discussed in the Knesset in 1970  one Israeli legislator confidently projected that  it won t be long   a year  a year and a half  two at most   before the thing called  the held territories  is no more  and the Israel Defense Force pulls back into Israel s borders  Needless to say  that  thing  is far from being  no more   While the Rogers Plans have since all but disappeared from memory  erased by a string of plans put forward by successive American presidents  reality in the occupied Palestinian territories didn t simply halt  Israel s occupation has deepened and evolved  Gaza has become the world s largest open air prison  bombed into submission every few years  East Jerusalem was formally annexed by Israel  the West Bank has become an archipelago of Palestinian Bantustans  surrounded by settlements  walls and checkpoints  subject to a mix of state and settler violence  Yet Israel s real feat has not only been achieving all of this but doing so with impunity  triggering minimal consequences from the rest of the world  all the while somehow holding on to its valuable public relations label as a  vibrant democracy  The history of these past 50 years is what we should recognize as the real deal  the one that is already in effect  the deal of the half century  In this deal  as long as Israel advances its occupation enterprise while applying a measure of brutality just below the level that would prompt international outrage  it is allowed to carry on  while still enjoying various international perks justified by grand  but obviously hollow  commitments to   as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently put it   the  shared values of liberty and democracy  ImageElectoral campaign posters bearing the portraits of Israel s prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  left

subjects denied that same right  Israeli settlers in the West Bank don t even need to drive to a polling station inside Israel to vote on their Palestinian neighbors  fate  Even settlers in the heart of Hebron can vote right there  with 285 registered voters  out of a total population of about 1 000 settlers   surrounded by some 200 000 Palestinian nonvoters  Or as Israel calls it   democracy

since the occupation began  and perhaps the one in which Palestinian lives are least discussed   except when tallying up their deaths and celebrating their destruction  Earlier this year  Gen  Benny Gantz  now leader of the new  centrist  party that poses the strongest challenge to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  published a video highlighting how many Palestinian  terrorists  were killed in Gaza in the summer of 2014  when Mr  Gantz was the Army s chief of staff   According to research carried out by the Israeli nonprofit B Tselem  most of those killed by the Israeli army that summer were civilians  among them more than 500 children   For his part  Mr  Netanyahu has promised that if he remains in office the occupation will continue   I will not divide Jerusalem  I will not evacuate any community and I will make sure we control the territory west of Jordan   he said in an interview over the weekend Instead of the rights and freedom of Palestinians  the campaign season has focused on Mr  Netanyahu s likely indictment on corruption charges  But does it really matter to the Palestinian family whose son will be killed with impunity or whose home will be bulldozed if the prime minister responsible for these policies is corrupt or squeaky clean At some point after April 9  we may finally get to see what  deal  the Trump administration has in mind  In fact  one cannot help wondering if it isn t already taking shape before our very eyes  Last May  the Trump administration moved the United States  embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  a few months later  it cut off aid to Palestinians and the United Nations agency serving Palestinian refugees  most recently  it extended recognition of Israel s sovereignty in the Golan Heights  a move celebrated by one Israeli official as a sign of things to come with regards to the future of the West Bank It s hard to see how the  deal of the century  will be anything other than an extension of the deal of the half century  David M  Friedman  the Trump administration s ambassador to Israel  more or less admitted this in an interview with The Washington Examiner  when he said that the administration would  like to see Palestinian autonomy improve significantly  as long as it doesn t come at the risk of Israeli security   But Palestinians deserve full freedom  not an American marketed improved autonomy  which suggests nothing more than prolonging Israel s occupation  That means a future based on neither justice nor on international law  but on more control  oppression and state violence Unless the international community takes the deal of the half century off the table  making Israel finally choose between further oppression of Palestinians and facing real consequences  the occupation will continue  The Trump administration  clearly  isn t up to this task  But the United Nations  including the Security Council  key member states of the European Union   Israel s largest trading partner   and international public opinion all have ample leverage  And Americans who sincerely believe in human rights and democracy  not just as empty slogans or bargaining chips but as genuine demands  need not wait until 2020 to flex their political power Together with the systemic overtaking of lands and the imposition of restrictions on freedom of movement  the denial of political rights was one of the cornerstones of apartheid South Africa  That country  too  considered itself a democracy Many Israelis will consider April 9 a celebration of democracy  It s not  This Election Day should be nothing more than a painful reminder of a deeply undemocratic reality  one that the Trump administration seems pleased to perpetuate   and which the rest of the international community will continue to allow until it finally stops looking the other way  We  the nearly 14 million human beings living on this land  need a future that is worth fighting for  one based on the common humanity of

NEW DELHI   The Indian government may have to make a series of major changes at the top of the nation s civil service if Prime Minister Narendra Modi is re elected to a second term in May  according to multiple sources in the administration At least eight senior bureaucrats in the prime minister s office have either sought a transfer to other departments or plan to take premature retirement  three government officials said  The officials  from the prime minister s office  the home  interior  ministry and the foreign ministry  declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject Two of them said they too are keen to be transferred to state capitals or to other jobs  They said officials in several ministries were trying to move  but did not have a number There are about 25 senior civil servants working in the prime minister s office  which under Modi has become the single most powerful department in government The three officials said the reasons for wanting out are almost all the same  Many top bureaucrats complained about two aspects of the Modi administration   their inability to influence government policy as it is largely controlled and set by the prime minister and a small group of ministers and advisers  and the demanding work schedule they face  The sense of partnership is missing  Modi and his ministers do not have an organic relationship with the bureaucrats   said the civil servant in the home ministry  Sanjay Mayukh  a spokesman for Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   declined to comment on the grounds that governance issues were managed directly by ministers A spokesman in the prime minister s office did not return phone calls seeking comment To be sure  some other major governments around the world often face a series of departures and changes  especially when a first term morphs into a second term  Also  just because an official talks about quitting doesn t mean they will  But in India  officials in the prime minister s office are hand picked for loyalty and tend to stay if the administration is re elected  Modi s BJP led alliance is tipped to win a slim majority in the April May general election  pollsters say  Senior bureaucrats said Modi s top down approach  and his orders to work on public holidays  to demand they submit details of their assets  and to clean their own workplaces at the start of a five year cleanliness campaign in 2014  has widened the gap between the civil servants and the nation s leader Amit Shah  a close aide of Modi and the head of the BJP  in a closed door meeting attended by two ministers in February said bureaucrats continued to suffer from  communist romanticism   a reference to the alleged influence of the left leaning Congress opposition party on the bureaucrats  The ministers  who spoke to Reuters  declined to be identified DISCONNECT WITH RULING PARTYFor some of the 5 000 or so mandarins who run the Indian government  its state owned entities  as well as administration at state government level  Modi s style of leadership has been a jolt  Many of these top officials have received a Western style education at India s elite universities or schools overseas and are uncomfortable with the ruling party s right wing Hindu nationalism and Modi s rough hewn approach to governance While getting into the Indian Administrative Service  IAS   is incredibly hard   only 1 out of about 4 500 who took the civil service exam got selected in 2018   traditionally once someone got in they had a job for life with few risks of ever getting fired  An IAS job   one of the most sought after in India   bestows huge power as well as cheap housing  a car with a driver and other perks  leave for government paid foreign study  and often the chance for plum positions in business or government consultative work after retirement  There is also a handsome pension But such conditions can also breed complacency and a lack of  can do  behavior  according to Indian politicians and civil servants  They say there are plenty of Sir Humphreys in New Delhi  referring to a character in the British TV comedy series  Yes Minister  about how top officials in Whitehall stall government policies they don t agree with  In particular  there is deep resentment in the top echelons of the Indian civil service over the interference in government by the Rashtriya Swayemsevak Sangh  RSS   the Hindu right wing umbrella group of which the BJP is a part  these officials said  RSS functionaries have had a major role in successfully lobbying for big changes at the Reserve Bank of India  for example  leading to last December s resignation of its governor and his replacement with an official who is considered more loyal to Modi  officials said  TECHNOCRATS  NOT GENERALISTSRSS figures also criticize Modi for not having enough professionally trained experts in place to implement some of his more controversial policies  The country needs a professional administration for economic development and can t depend on generalists   said Ashwani Mahajan  co convenor of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch  SJM   the economic wing of the RSS that has campaigned against some bureaucrats  Last year  Modi proposed bringing in at least ten professionals from the private sector into the civil service at the joint secretary level  but the plan has still to be implemented  and is facing strong resistance from civil servants  Joint Secretaries are two rungs below full Secretaries  the top civil servant in a ministry A senior finance ministry official said major policy decisions including demonetization  Modi s decision to wipe out high denomination bank notes without warning in 2016 and to hastily launch a goods and services tax that hit millions of small businesses and jobs  were examples of political decisions that didn t get enough airing among officials before being implemented  Both are thought to have hurt jobs growth  economists say  There is a wider concern in the civil service about India being ruled by a Hindu nationalist party that some see destroying the country s previous tolerant and secular nature But the hours are as much of a concern to some  I am looking out for other opportunities and have even requested for a transfer because it is almost impossible to work for 12 13 hours every day  even during weekends   said a senior official working with Modi since 2014   Reporting by Manoj Kumar  Rupam Jain   Editing by Martin Howell and Raju Gopalakrishnan  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s administration stepped up pressure on the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on Tuesday  raising the likelihood that he might fire more senior officials as the agency struggles with a surge of immigrants on the U S  Mexico border Two days after Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced her departure  a senior administration official said others at DHS were not doing enough to enact Trump s promised immigration crackdown  a top priority for him since he announced his candidacy for the White House four years ago DHS acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady offered her resignation to Trump  effective Wednesday  after a 28 year career at the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security  Nielsen said in a tweet late on Tuesday Several other DHS officials could be forced out soon  said an official familiar with the matter Among them were the department s general counsel  John Mitnick  and U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  Director Francis Cissna  the source said  A DHS spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the officials  expected tenure Trump denied that he was overhauling DHS and said his administration was fighting  bad laws  on immigration and a court system that  never ever rules for us    a frequent refrain of his as a succession of policies to curb entry to the United States has been met with legal challenges by civil rights advocates  Nobody ever said I was cleaning house   Trump told reporters at the White House Nielsen announced her resignation on Sunday after a meeting with Trump in which the two disagreed on the best way to handle border security  The personnel changes could further destabilize the U S  domestic security agency as it tries to stem rising numbers of immigrants arriving at the border  many of them families fleeing violence and poverty in Central America  DHS said it arrested or denied entry to more than 103 000 people along the border last month  more than double the March 2018 figure  The U S  Secret Service said on Monday that its chief  Randolph  Tex  Alles  would depart his job next month  Trump last Friday withdrew the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to serve as director of U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement Several top DHS jobs are either vacant or filled on an acting basis  including positions responsible for disaster response  immigration enforcement  finance  policy  and science and technology  It s not good to have all these people performing in an acting position   said Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson  a Republican FRUSTRATIONSTrump has grown increasingly frustrated as DHS officials have told him that the dramatic immigration changes they seek are not possible under current law and would require the cooperation of Congress  several sources say Trump repeatedly pressed Nielsen over recent weeks to bring back last year s controversial policy of separating migrant children from their parents  one source said  Trump abandoned that policy last year in the face of widespread public outrage  and it was subsequently struck down in court Trump denied on Tuesday that he was reviving the separation policy  Johnson said that policy would have  no support  in Congress A senior administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said one option may be to give migrant families a choice of staying in long term detention together while they await a court hearing or splitting up  an idea known as  binary choice   The administration may also move to detain migrant children for longer than the 20 day maximum set by a court ruling  to spur a legal challenge that could overturn that limit  the official said  The official said DHS has been too slow in drafting new rules that would tighten immigration The official singled out USCIS  saying it had not moved quickly enough to tighten H 1B visas for skilled workers and has granted an  astronomical  number of asylum claims Asylum officers found that applicants had a  credible fear  of persecution in their home countries in 78 percent of the cases they decided between October and February  according to USCIS data The White House could anger allies in Congress if it fires USCIS head Cissna  who previously worked with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said on Twitter that Cissna was  doing what voters asked4 w PresTrump election  Any move to fire Cissna or other DHS leaders would likely complicate the department s leadership woes U S  Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan is due to take Nielsen s place on a temporary basis  starting on Wednesday  leaving DHS without a permanent leader on the front lines of the border crisis DHS s acting deputy secretary Grady was legally supposed to take over after Nielsen s departure  so Grady s resignation on Tuesday cleared the way for McAleenan to take the agency s reins Trump has interviewed several candidates for the top job over the past week and a half  including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach  former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli  and former acting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement head Thomas Homan  All three have expressed hard line views on illegal immigration  and could have difficulty winning confirmation in the U S  Senate  which Trump s Republicans control by a 53 47 margin Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Congress needed to set aside its differences to overhaul immigration laws  which it has repeatedly failed to do over the past 15 years   Reporting by Andy Sullivan and Roberta Rampton  additional reporting by Makini Brice  Jeff Mason  Yeganeh Torbati  Susan Cornwell and Doina Chiacu

WASHINGTON   President Trump moved to clear out the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security on Monday  a day after  forcing the resignation of its secretary  Kirstjen Nielsen  as he accelerated a purge of the nation s immigration and security leadership The White House announced the departure of Randolph D  Alles  the director of the Secret Service  who had fallen out of favor with the president even before a security breach at his Mar a Lago club that the agency effectively blamed on Mr  Trump s employees Government officials  who asked not to be identified discussing personnel changes before they were announced  said at least two to four more high ranking figures affiliated with Ms  Nielsen were expected to leave soon  too  hollowing out the top echelon of the department managing border security  presidential safety  counterterrorism  natural disasters  customs and other matters The wave of departures of officials originally appointed by Mr  Trump underscored his growing frustration with his own administration s handling of immigration and other security issues  In recent days  Mr  Trump has threatened to close the southwestern border altogether only to back off and give Mexico a one year notice in the face of warnings about deep economic damage from such a move The shake up  coming more than two years into Mr  Trump s term  indicated that he is still searching for a team that will fulfill his desire for an even tougher approach to immigration  It also signaled the enduring influence of Stephen Miller  the president s hard line senior adviser who has complained about recalcitrant homeland security officials Some of the president s allies complained that he was going too far  taking out subordinates who actually share his goals on immigration at the prodding of White House aides hunting for scapegoats for the failure to control the border as he has promised to do  Without names  there s people in the White House that speak about immigration   Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  said in an interview   They haven t accomplished a whole lot  so they need to find some other way to make themselves look important  The latest shuffle came just a day after Mr  Trump pushed out Ms  Nielsen for not doing enough in his view to secure the border and three days after Ronald D  Vitiello  the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  was told to step aside so the administration could go in a  tougher direction   as Mr  Trump put it Officials said they expect to see the departures of L  Francis Cissna  the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  Kathy Nuebel Kovarik  one of his top deputies  and John Mitnick  the department s general counsel and a senior member of Ms  Nielsen s leadership team  All of them were said to be viewed by Mr  Miller as obstacles to implementing the president s policies The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other The White House is also pressing for the resignation of Claire Grady  the acting deputy secretary  who under law would normally fill in for Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Trump has already announced that he will install Kevin K  McAleenan  the Customs and Border Protection commissioner  as Ms  Nielsen s acting replacement  which he cannot do if Ms  Grady remains in place The latest moves appeared to be a housecleaning of officials associated with John F  Kelly  the president s former chief of staff and his first homeland security secretary  who was pushed out at the end of last year after months of tension with Mr  Trump Mr  Alles  a retired Marine major general who served with Mr  Kelly in the military and goes by Tex  was the first person from outside the Secret Service to head the agency in more than a century and some administration officials said he had a hard time fitting in At Mr  Trump s instruction  Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  told Mr  Alles at least 10 days ago to expect a transition after two years in office and to develop an exit plan  according to officials familiar with the discussions Mr  Trump  who talks with members of his own Secret Service detail  had soured on Mr  Alles a while ago  convinced that as an outsider he was not popular among the agents  officials said  The president even made fun of the director s looks  calling him Dumbo because of his ears  But a Secret Service ally of Mr  Alles disputed the notion that he did not fit in  saying that the director was well liked among the work force Mr  Alles was told to develop an exit plan before the arrest of a Chinese woman carrying a malware laced device at Mar a Lago  exposing holes in the security of the private club  The Secret Service was so disturbed that it issued a statement faulting the club s staff for not tracking its guests closely enough Some Secret Service officials said on Monday that they suspected that Mr  Alles s departure was accelerated in part because of the episode The White House made no mention of that in its statement announcing Mr  Alles s departure issued shortly after it was reported by CNN Mr  Alles  has done a great job at the agency over the last two years  and the president is thankful for his over 40 years of service to the country   Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  said in the statement She said he would be replaced in May by James M  Murray  a career Secret Service official who oversees protective operations Mr  Alles was the focus of an early fight between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kelly in the first months of the administration  Mr  Kelly threatened to resign as homeland security secretary if Mr  Alles was not made Secret Service director  according to former administration officials ImageRandolph D  Alles  the director of the Secret Service  received instructions 10 days ago to come up with an exit plan and was expected to leave on his own timeline CreditDavid Goldman Associated PressIn an email message to his work force on Monday  Mr  Alles confirmed that his departure was ordered by the president last month  No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my  firing    he wrote   I assure you that this is not the case  and in fact was told weeks ago by the administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security  The president has directed an orderly transition in leadership for this agency and I intend to abide by that direction   he added   It is my sincere regret that I was not able to address the work force prior to this announcement  Regardless of when the decision was made  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said Mr  Alles should testify before Congress about the Mar a Lago breach  The public and Congress need to know the extent to which adversarial governments   like China   and their agents are attempting to gain access to  or conduct electronic surveillance on  conversations or other information regarding national security at President Trump s properties   he said Not all of Mr  Trump s allies were happy with the moves  There s no doubt that Cissna has proved his competence  in a lot of things he s doing   things that the president is for   Mr  Grassley said  Referring to Mr  Cissna and Ms  Kovarik  both of whom once worked on his staff  Mr  Grassley said   If he gets rid of these two  it s self defeating because I don t know anyone else in the department or at least in immigration  who could do better One administration official said Mr  Cissna angered Mr  Miller by refusing to make changes to asylum policy without congressional approval  Under current law  unauthorized immigrants facing expedited removal may seek asylum before an immigration judge if found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture As for Ms  Nielsen  she expressed no unhappiness about her departure on Monday and thanked Mr  Trump  for the tremendous opportunity  to serve her country and the employees of her department for their efforts to secure the nation The latest departures  along with previous vacancies  will leave the Department of Homeland Security without a permanent secretary  deputy secretary  two under secretaries  Secret Service director  Federal Emergency Management Agency director  ICE director  general counsel  citizenship and immigration services director  inspector general  chief financial officer  chief privacy officer and  once Mr  McAleenan moves  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  The purge of senior leadership at the Department of Homeland Security is unprecedented and a threat to our national security   said Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California Senator Ron Johnson  Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  complained about  congressional dysfunction  in addressing border security  but added   I am concerned with a growing leadership void within the department tasked with addressing some of the most significant problems facing the nation   

For 340 days  Scott Kelly circled the Earth aboard the International Space Station  gathering data about himself He drew blood from his arms  He saved his urine  He played computer games to test his memory and reaction speed  He measured the shape of his eyes Two hundred and forty miles below  Mr  Kelly s twin brother  Mark  who also served as an astronaut  carried out identical tests  Now  a comparison of these two men has provided a unique opportunity to learn what happens to the human body in space   down to the molecular level  On Thursday  just over three years after Mr  Kelly  55  returned to Earth  NASA researchers reported that his body experienced a vast number of changes while in orbit  DNA mutated in some of his cells  His immune system produced a host of new signals  His microbiome gained new species of bacteria   Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar  Many of these biological changes seemed harmless  disappearing after he returned to Earth  But others   including genetic mutations and  after his return  declines in cognitive test scores   did not correct themselves  provoking concern among scientists Some considered the risks manageable  while others wondered whether it would ever be safe for astronauts to take long journeys to Mars or beyond  Final answers will depend on studies of still more astronauts ImageMark Kelly

Translational Institute  who was not involved in the study   I don t know that there s been anything close to this  Although astronauts have been carried aloft for almost six decades  there s much about life in space that scientists still don t understand  With investigations like the NASA Twins Study  published in the journal Science  the agency hopes to answer some of the questions before sending astronauts on longer flights In 2012  NASA picked Mr  Kelly to join the Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko aboard the space station for a yearlong examination of the challenges of space

biologist at Colorado State University and a co author of the new study   We can say that  as best as we can tell  these changes are due to spaceflight  ImageMr  Kelly administering a flu shot to himself in September 2015  part of the Twins Study CreditJSC NASATen research teams designed experiments for the twins  they are likely to bring an avalanche of research  But to Mr  Kelly  the experience didn t feel very different from previous missions  Drawing his own blood in zero gravity  for example  was a familiar routine   I ve had a couple spills in my time   Mr  Kelly said   You just reach out and grab the blobs of blood  By many measures  the scientists eventually found  Mr  Kelly changed about as much as astronauts who stayed on the space station for only six months  Eventually the pace of biological change slowed  suggesting that perhaps the human body reaches a new equilibrium in space But Mr  Kelly s body was also altered in some surprising ways Scott Kelly Spent a Year Taking Photos in Space  They re Beautiful In orbit aboard the International Space Station  the astronaut wasn t just gathering data for NASA s Twins Study  He also produced some  well  stellar images April 12  2019Dr  Bailey studied special sections of his DNA called telomeres  which sit at the end of chromosomes  protecting them from deterioration  As people age  their telomeres tend to get shorter  Stress   such as radiation or pollution   may hasten aging by fraying telomeres even faster than usual Strangely  the average length of Mr  Kelly s telomeres increased in space  rather than decreasing  as if his cells were becoming more youthful  Regular exercise and a healthy diet might be part of the reason  But going to space also might have awakened a quiet population of stem cells in Mr  Kelly s body  Dr  Bailey said  His cells might not have grown longer telomeres  in other words  Instead  perhaps his body manufactured a new supply of young cells with longer telomeres Activated genesGoing to space also appeared to trigger a genetic shift in Mr  Kelly  Thousands of genes that were once quiet increased their activity   genes that remained quiet in Mark Kelly s body back on Earth  The longer Scott Kelly stayed aloft  the greater the number of genes becoming active Some of the awakened genes are known to encode proteins that help fix damaged DNA  That would make sense  given that radiation levels in the International Space Station are higher than on Earth  Christopher Mason  a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York  estimated that Mr  Kelly was exposed to 48 times more radiation than the average exposure on Earth over the course of a year  His cells might have been busy repairing radiation injury ImageMr  Kelly on a spacewalk in December 2015 CreditNASA  via Associated PressA number of other activated genes  however  play roles in the immune system  What exactly triggers those changes isn t clear  It may be the overall stress of life in the space station provokes an immune response  But recent studies have also shown that latent viruses can awaken in astronauts  Or maybe it s that the immune system  which never evolved for survival in space  simply gets confused  Is it good or bad  We just know it s more   Dr  Mason  a co author of the new study  said of the immune activity   To know for sure  we d need more astronauts  Mr  Kelly s return to Earth on March 1  2016  proved to be one of the biggest moments   biologically speaking   of the whole mission  His body showed signs of intense stress  and his immune system was in high gear  Michael Snyder  a geneticist at Stanford University and co author of the research  cautioned that this response might not be typical   Maybe he got a viral infection   he speculated   This is why you want to see it in more people  Despite that shock  Mr  Kelly s body mostly returned to preflight condition  Some species of bacteria that thrived in his gut while he was in space  for example  became rare again on his landing The strange lengthening of Mr  Kelly s telomeres disappeared after less than 48 hours on Earth  In fact  Dr  Bailey and her colleagues started finding many cells with telomeres that were shorter than before Mr  Kelly went to space  People have asked me   Well  is going to space the fountain of youth    said Dr  Bailey   I don t think so  If it is  you re going to have to stay up there forever   Fighting through quicksand Some aspects of Mr  Kelly s biology didn t return to the preflight norm Six months after he came back to Earth  8 7 percent of his genes were still behaving in an altered way  Judging from the small size of this shift  Dr  Snyder described the change as modest The researchers also found that Mr  Kelly didn t do as well on his return on cognitive exams   He got slower and less accurate on virtually all of the tests   said Dr  Mathias Basner  a cognitive scientist at the University of Pennsylvania It s possible that some biological change was to blame  But Dr  Basner noted that Mr  Kelly also faced a lot of demands back on Earth  including a busy schedule of television interviews and public speaking And on an unconscious level  he may no longer have been pushing himself   I mean  he basically retired the moment he hit the ground  and so perhaps he just wasn t as motivated any longer   Dr  Basner said ImageRegular exercise and healthy diet  zero gravity M M s notwithstanding  might partly explain how Mr  Kelly s cellular telomeres lengthened  He lost 15 pounds on the space station CreditJSC NASAIn his 2017 memoir   Endurance   Mr  Kelly describes struggling after his return with pain  sleeping troubles and other woes  One night he felt as if he was  fighting through quicksand   he wrote In an interview  Mr  Kelly speculated those difficulties might be to blame for his cognitive scores   It s hard to concentrate when you re not feeling well   he said Another enduring change  scientists found  was a collection of genetic mutations that Mr  Kelly gained in space   We see them appear in flight  and then they persisted afterward   Dr  Mason said Sometimes radiation triggers a type of mutation that makes cells prone to gain still more mutations as they divide  Eventually  the cells may start growing uncontrollably    taking steps on the road to cancer   Dr  Bailey said Peter Campbell  a cancer biologist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Britain who was not involved in the new study  said scientists can t predict what the extra mutations will mean for Mr  Kelly s health   It is hard to be sure  but I believe those sorts of numbers would be associated with a moderate increase in cancer risk   he said These two lingering changes   in Mr  Kelly s cognition and DNA   left a number of experts concerned about the risks of a trip to Mars  which could take a year Gary Strangman  a psychologist at Harvard Medical School  said that a decrease in speed and accuracy  could potentially have serious consequences on long duration missions  After a grueling journey to the red planet  astronauts would probably need to take quick  accurate actions as they landed  If you had a period of slower cognitive processing speed and difficulty with balance and eye head coordination  those behaviors would be at risk   said Rachael Seidler  a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Florida A heavy load of genetic mutations would not present immediate dangers to astronauts on their missions  but it might raise their lifelong risks of cancer  Dr  Mason estimated that a mission to Mars would expose an astronaut to eight times more radiation than Mr  Kelly experienced  Every effort will need to be made to limit exposure to astronauts during periods of prolonged space travel   said Charles Swanton  a cancer biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in Britain who was not involved in the new study Dr  Topol  of the Scripps institute  found the implications of Mr  Kelly s experience to be grim  The main conclusion I got from this paper  based on all the objective data  is why would anybody want to go to Mars or be in space   he said   Because this is really scary  Jerry Shay  a cell biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center  was much more optimistic  He held out hope for countermeasures that would protect astronauts Already he and his colleagues  for example  are testing drugs to trigger cells to fix DNA damaged by radiation   I think all these problems are solvable   Dr  Shay said NASA has begun sifting through all these results to help plan the next round of missions to the International Space Station  It won t be a replication of what you saw in the Twins Study   said Jennifer Fogarty  the chief scientist at NASA s Human Research Program  We re going to learn from that  and we re going to be smarter about the questions we ask  There s a lot of fascinating stuff to go measure  It s just not clear what it means  Dr  Bailey  for her part  plans to keep on studying Mr  Kelly s baffling telomeres  Solving that mystery might shed light on ordinary aging and the diseases it brings  When we figure out the how and why of that  it s going to be important for astronauts as well as for us mere Earthlings   she said ImageMr  Kelly on a helicopter in Kazakhstan after returning from the space station in March 2011

WASHINGTON   The Latest on the departure of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  all times local  12 45 p m Kirstjen  KEER  sten  Nielsen says she continues to support President Donald Trump s goal of securing the U S  Mexico border in her first public remarks since her surprise resignation as Homeland Security secretary Nielsen told reporters gathered outside her Alexandria  Virginia  home on Monday that she will keep supporting  all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis  on the border Nielsen thanks the Republican president for  the tremendous opportunity to serve this country   She says she s spent the last 24 hours talking to administration officials and members of Congress to ensure a smooth transition and intends to continue  to support  the department  from the outside  Nielsen resigned Sunday amid Trump s growing frustration and bitterness over a spike in Central American migrants crossing the border Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan has taken over as department head    12 55 a m Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has resigned amid President Donald Trump s growing frustration and bitterness over the number of Central American families crossing the southern border Trump announced on Sunday in a tweet that U S  Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would be taking over as acting head of the department  McAleenan is a longtime border official who is well respected by members of Congress and within the administration  The decision to name a top immigration officer to the post reflects Trump s priority for the sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept  11 attacks Though Trump aides were eyeing a staff shake up at Homeland Security and had already withdrawn the nomination for another key immigration post  the development Sunday was unexpected  

Time finally ran out for Kirstjen Nielsen  President Trump s beleaguered secretary of homeland security The terms of Ms  Nielsen s departure are unclear  She met with the president on Sunday evening to discuss continuing problems at the southern border  At the conclusion of the meeting  Mr  Trump announced on Twitter that Ms  Nielsen  will be leaving her position  and he thanked her for her service  implying he had asked her to step down  Ms  Nielsen issued a formal letter of resignation  saying it was the  right time for me to step aside   Considering the long simmering tensions between the president and Ms  Nielsen  the most surprising thing about her departure may be that it didn t happen months ago She was said to have become increasingly insecure in her job in recent weeks  as Mr  Trump repeatedly railed about the chaos at the border and pushed for dramatic action  including reinstating his policy of separating migrant families at the border and closing legal ports of entry  The president grew impatient with Ms  Nielsen s insistence that federal law and international obligations limited her actions  In recent days  including in the hours immediately after the secretary s resignation  he repeatedly fumed that  our country is full   It s no secret that Mr  Trump had a problem with Ms  Nielsen  whom he considered  weak  on matters of border security  The president and Stephen Miller  his hard line immigration adviser  have long grumbled privately about the secretary s insufficiently brutal approach to the surge in migrant families across the border  Last May  stories surfaced about Mr  Trump berating her in front of the entire cabinet for failing to stop the crossings  In her letter released on Sunday  Ms  Nielsen noted   For more than two years of service beginning during the Presidential Transition  I have worked tirelessly to advance the goals and missions of the Department  This is hardly something to brag about  Whatever the secretary s personal views  and no matter how impossible her job  she was the face of some of the administration s most poorly conceived and gratuitously callous policies  At best  she was complicit and  yes  rather weak Ms  Nielsen s response to her boss s displeasure and abuse was often both morally anemic and strategically incoherent  Last summer  as Republicans and Democrats   and much of the American public   protested the administration s practice of tearing migrant children from their parents at the border  Ms  Nielsen rushed to defend the policy  Scratch that  She insisted  repeatedly and bizarrely  that the administration had no such policy  even as her agency was enforcing and justifying it   We do not have a policy of separating families at the border   she said on Twitter in June   Period   She repeated as much to Congress as recently as March  But the grim repercussions of this nonpolicy are still being felt  Just on Friday  in a court filing  federal officials said it could take up to two years to identify possibly thousands of migrant children taken from their families beginning in July 2017 Not that immigration was the only issue on which Ms  Nielsen floundered  On the critical question of Russia s meddling in the 2016 elections  she was even less lucid  At times  she seemed to support the intelligence community s findings that the Kremlin had been up to no good  Other times  she supported the view that Russia had not favored Mr  Trump in the election  Her every utterance seemed intended to obfuscate rather than to clarify Ms  Nielsen s departure is part of a broader purging in her department  Two days before meeting with the secretary  the president withdrew his nomination for the next head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency  saying that he wanted to go in a  tougher direction   On Monday  the White House confirmed that Randolph Alles  the head of the Secret Service  was on his way out as well  The general counsel for Homeland Security  John Mitnick  and the head of Citizenship and Immigration Services  L  Francis Cissna  are expected to soon follow  For now  Ms  Nielsen s acting replacement will be Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  This leaves Homeland Security without a top official at either of its critical immigration agencies  It comes as the swell of migrant families across the border pushes the system toward collapse  Possible successors being discussed include Rick Perry  the secretary of energy  and Ken Cuccinelli  the former attorney general of Virginia Whoever takes Ms  Nielsen s place  it seems likely that greater influence will be exerted by Mr  Miller  who inspires and reinforces Mr  Trump s harshest impulses on immigrants and immigration  As the president becomes increasingly agitated about the border situation  Mr  Miller is said to be aggressively pushing to stock the administration with like minded hard liners  In addition to being a longtime critic of Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Miller is thought to have played a role in the withdrawal of the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead ICE and the impending departure of Mr  Cissna  The House speaker  Nancy Pelosi  a Democrat  said of Ms  Nielsen s departure   It is deeply alarming that the Trump administration official who put children in cages is reportedly resigning because she is not extreme enough for the White House s liking  The plan is for Ms  Nielsen to continue through Wednesday to help with an  orderly transition    I share the president s goal of securing the border   she said Monday morning   I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border  If Ms  Nielsen is inclined to perform one last act of public service  she should come clean about the costs of the policies she enforced over the past year and a half  not only to the desperate migrants seeking a better life in the United States  but also to the thousands of employees of her department charged with carrying out an inhumane and ineffective agenda  RelatedKirstjen Nielsen Resigns as Trump s Homeland Security SecretaryApril 7  2019Kevin McAleenan  Top U S  Border Enforcement

UNITED NATIONS   Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday urged the United Nations to revoke the credentials of Venezuela s ambassador to the world body  portraying him as a loyalist to the country s disputed president  Nicolás Maduro  and to a government that has allowed crime  violence and starvation to rise In a 20 minute speech to the United Nations Security Council  Mr  Pence called for a formal recognition of Juan Guaidó as the rightful leader of Venezuela  which he called  a failed state   and as history teaches  failed states know no boundaries  Mr  Pence turned to the Venezuelan ambassador  Samuel Moncada Acosta  telling him   You shouldn t be here   You should return to Venezuela and tell Nicolás Maduro that his time is up   Mr  Pence said   It s time for him to go  The Council meeting addressed the situation in Venezuela  which officials and experts are increasingly describing as a humanitarian crisis that has led about 3 5 million citizens to flee the country Instead of offering temporary asylum to Venezuelans  the Trump administration has called for Mr  Maduro s ouster to relieve a country rattled by skyrocketing inflation  widespread blackouts and a growing public health crisis  The United States  as a replacement  is forcefully supporting Mr  Guaidó  the National Assembly politician whom the administration recognizes as the rightful interim president On Wednesday  Mr  Pence also accused China and Russia of meddling in efforts to remove Mr  Maduro  While  Russia and China continue to obstruct at the Security Council   Mr  Pence said   rogue states like Iran and Cuba are doing all they can to prop up the Maduro regime  Global rivalries have hindered the ability of the United Nations to address the crisis  despite intensifying warnings that the situation is deteriorating In February  the United States and Russia introduced dueling resolutions on Venezuela at the Security Council  The American proposal called for free and fair elections  and the Russian plan backed Mr  Maduro s government  Both failed Two weeks ago  President Trump warned Russia to  get out of  Venezuela after two of Moscow s military planes landed in Caracas  the Venezuelan capital  to unload supplies and military personnel  But Mr  Trump has done little else to publicly engage as the crisis continues That role has fallen to Mr  Pence  But on Wednesday  he did not give a firm answer when asked by a reporter where the United States would draw a line on Russia s involvement  He also did not give a timeline when asked if the possibility of American military intervention  an option long played up by administration officials  was drawing closer as conditions in Venezuela worsened Instead  the Trump administration has tried to choke off Mr  Maduro s economic resources  Last week  it announced a round of sanctions targeting oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba  the latest in a string of initiatives meant to curb Caracas s ability to do business  Visas have been revoked in recent weeks for hundreds of Mr  Maduro s associates In briefings held before Mr  Pence arrived to speak  United Nations officials warned of a situation that has only grown more dire as unrest continues and said that offering relief to Venezuelan citizens should not be a political issue Mark Lowcock  an under secretary for humanitarian affairs  told the Security Council that a recent draft overview of the situation by the United Nations indicated that around 1 9 million people require nutritional assistance because of worsening food availability  including 1 3 million children under 5  Additionally  Mr  Lowcock said  tuberculosis  diphtheria  measles  malaria and other preventable diseases have resurfaced in Venezuela Food shortages also remain a main factor in driving people out of the country  Surveys show that 80 percent of Venezuelan households struggle with finding enough food  United Nations officials said  In Venezuela  there is a need to separate political and humanitarian objectives   Mr  Lowcock said   Humanitarian assistance must be delivered on the basis of need alone  The number of people expected to leave Venezuela may surpass five million by the year s end  said Eduardo Stein  a special United Nations envoy for Venezuelan refugees and migrants Citing a worsening public health crisis aggravated by constant blackouts  Kathleen Page  a doctor and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine  urged the Security Council to declare a humanitarian crisis formally and address it in a  neutral  independent and impartial  way On Tuesday  Mr  Maduro said he had met with members of the Red Cross to finalize plans for the arrival of aid to Venezuela  His government and the opposition reached a deal to organize a large scale relief effort late last month  We reiterated our disposition to establish cooperation mechanisms for international aid and assistance   Mr  Maduro wrote Tuesday on Twitter The United States still does not have a permanent representative to the United Nations  a fact that reporters pointed out to Mr  Pence as he fielded questions over whether the Security Council would support his demand to revoke the Venezuelan ambassador s credentials Mr  Pence said he felt that  momentum is on the side of freedom   

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s new acting chief of Homeland Security will be under pressure to implement legally dubious solutions to an influx of migrants at the U S  Mexico border   policies that his predecessor either could not  or would not  deliver  Kevin McAleenan  presently commissioner of U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP   will be the fourth person to helm the agency under Trump  He takes over as U S  border officials estimated that 100 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in March  the highest level in a decade The president  who made immigration a key campaign theme  has grown increasingly frustrated with his officials  even as they have implemented aggressive policies to limit immigration Immigration experts say Trump lately has called for policies that would violate U S  laws  international agreements and court settlements or require U S  Congress to pass major legislation On Friday  he called for Congress to  get rid of the whole asylum system  and get rid of immigration judges  and criticized a long standing federal court decree mandating certain standards of care for migrant children A congressional official familiar with the matter said some in Congress believe Trump forced out Kirstjen Nielsen  who resigned as secretary on Sunday  in part because she was trying to obey laws on treatment of refugees  granting of amnesty and separation of families A source close to Nielsen said Trump was convinced to oust her by his senior aide Stephen Miller  an immigration hardliner Nielsen did not respond to a request for comment It was not immediately clear what strategies McAleenan could implement to achieve Trump s objective of limiting migrant crossings at the southern border  especially as they are expected to reach their yearly peak in the coming months  experts said A U S  judge on Monday halted the administration s policy of sending some asylum seekers back across the border to wait out their cases in Mexico  a policy it said last week it planned to expand  The White House did not respond to a request for comment  So much of what the president put out there isn t really legally feasible   said Sarah Pierce  an immigration policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute  a non partisan think tank in Washington   I  like many  and maybe Nielsen herself are kind of puzzled as to what could happen  A CBP spokesman declined to comment and directed questions to the White House McAleenan follows Nielsen and Elaine Duke  who led the DHS on an acting basis after John Kelly  Trump s first DHS secretary  became White House chief of staff in 2017  Trump took office in January that year  ZERO TOLERANCE Nielsen oversaw a  zero tolerance  prosecution policy that led to the separation of thousands of parents and children  and launched a policy to return asylum seekers to Mexico until their claims are heard  Both policies garnered legal challenges  and both required extensive implementation by McAleenan and his agency Stephen Legomsky  a former chief counsel at U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services under Democratic President Barack Obama  said McAleenan likely will not have much freedom to pursue policies opposed by Trump or Miller  Whoever is put in that position in this administration is going to have a very hard time resisting the philosophy of the White House   Legomsky said John Sandweg  former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  during the Obama administration  said the Trump administration s focus on deterring migrants at the expense of other policies had hamstrung Nielsen and would likely hobble McAleenan  There s nothing we can do that s worse than what people are facing in Central America   he said   If we re going to work our way through this problem  being tough is not a strategy  it s a soundbite   NOT RADIOACTIVEWhite House officials said Trump wanted someone at DHS who would focus on the border as the top priority  McAleenan is seen as having a good relationship with Trump and 20 years of experience  so the president felt he would be a good choice to handle the influx at the border  officials said The White House envisions McAleenan working more with Congress  one official said  though the official declined to be specific about policy details  McAleenan is a rare Trump appointee with cordial relations with Democrats in Congress  After testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in December  McAleenan chatted afterwards for close to 15 minutes with Senator Dianne Feinstein and other Democrats on the committee  He s not considered to be radioactive   said a congressional Democratic aide on condition of anonymity Democratic Representative Joaquin Castro demanded McAleenan resign in December  after a Guatemalan migrant girl died in federal custody and McAleenan failed to report it to Congress within 24 hours  as required On Sunday  he said McAleenan s appointment as acting secretary was  deeply disturbing  Trump further reshuffled the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on Monday by replacing the director of the Secret Service   which does not have immigration responsibilities   with a career agent   Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball and Andy Sullivan in Washington  Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh  Susan Thomas and Sonya Hepinstall  

 President Trump said he is considering releasing migrants in so called sanctuary cities  Read the latest here  WASHINGTON   President Trump s top aides considered an idea to pressure immigration agencies to release apprehended migrants into so called sanctuary cities represented by Democratic lawmakers  according to several people familiar with the proposal The idea was floated in an email by a top White House policy adviser in November  when Mr  Trump was furiously condemning migrant caravans from Central America headed toward the southwestern border  the people  including two government officials  said In the email dated Nov  16  with the subject line  Sanctuary City Proposal   May Davis  the deputy White House policy coordinator  raised the idea with officials from the Department of Homeland Security  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection Ms  Davis suggested that migrants who had been apprehended and were slated to be released into border towns could instead be taken to one of several sanctuary cities  which limit how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration officers The proponents of the idea inside the White House argued at the time that it would help with overcrowding at nonprofit shelters in border towns by transferring the migrants to cities that already embrace the idea of having more immigrants  one official said Once there  the migrants would be released onto the streets   potentially sending a message to the Democratic politicians who oppose Mr  Trump s immigration agenda and his demands for a wall along the border with Mexico  The idea has been raised by one to two principals that  if we are unable to build sufficient temporary housing  that caravan members be bused to small  and mid sized sanctuary cities   Ms  Davis wrote to the officials at the agencies  She added   There is not a White House decision on this  Matthew Albence  the acting deputy director of ICE  objected to the idea  telling the White House that there would be liability issues if a migrant were injured during transport  He also raised concerns that the agency s budget had not been appropriated for that purpose In an email  Mr  Albence responded that the proposal would create  an unnecessary operational burden  on the department and added that he did not know how paying extra to transport migrants to another location was  a justified expenditure  Mr  Albence is in line to run ICE after the departure this week of Ronald D  Vitiello  whom Mr  Trump pushed out because the president said he was not responding to the surge of immigrants in a tough enough fashion  This was a suggestion that was floated and rejected  which ended any further discussion   a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on Thursday evening In a statement from the White House  an official called the proposal a  nonstory  and said that  these are illegal aliens already being released and sent to U S  communities every day   The administration s position is that we want to deport   not release   illegal aliens   the official said The plan to transport migrants to sanctuary cities  which was first reported Thursday evening by The Washington Post  did not go into effect  according to the officials ImageSpeaker Nancy Pelosi of California this week in Washington  A spokeswoman for Ms  Pelosi  who represents San Francisco  one of the most high profile sanctuary cities in the country  condemned the idea on Thursday night CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesBut the White House did raise the idea again several months later  in February  suggesting that releasing the immigrants into the sanctuary cities would be a way of punishing Democrats for resisting budget requests for more money to detain undocumented immigrants  according to one person familiar with it A White House official denied that punishing the Democratic lawmakers was the primary purpose of the idea  The official said that it was an effort to deal more efficiently with migrants who were already going to be released But at that time  officials at the Department of Homeland Security once again raised significant concerns about the idea s legality  and the proposal was not carried out A spokeswoman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi  Democrat of California  who represents San Francisco  one of the most high profile sanctuary cities in the country  condemned the idea on Thursday night  The extent of this administration s cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated   said Ashley Etienne  a spokeswoman for Ms  Pelosi   Using human beings   including little children   as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable  and in some cases  criminal  Ms  Etienne added   The American people have resoundingly rejected this administration s toxic anti immigrant policies  and Democrats will continue to advance immigration policies that keep us safe and honor our values  Mr  Trump has frequently  and harshly  criticized sanctuary cities  saying their actions are a violation of federal immigration laws and allow violent criminals who are undocumented immigrants back onto the streets instead of being deported During his campaign for the presidency  Mr  Trump often cited the case of Kate Steinle  who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco  He mentioned the case during a key immigration speech in 2016  months before the election  Another victim is Kate Steinle   Mr  Trump said   Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco  by an illegal immigrant  deported five previous times  And they knew he was no good  As president  he has continued to lash out at sanctuary cities  In remarks in the East Room in January 2018  Mr  Trump said that sanctuary cities were  the best friends of gangs and cartels  One person familiar with the proposal to transport migrants to sanctuary cities said that none of the proposals came directly from Stephen Miller  the architect of the president s immigration agenda and the top domestic policy adviser in the White House But the person said that Department of Homeland Security officials understood that Mr  Miller was a chief advocate of the idea  Mr  Miller did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday night But Mr  Albence said in a statement issued late Thursday by the department that  as the acting deputy  I was not pressured by anyone at the White House on this issue   I was asked my opinion and provided it and my advice was heeded   he said   The email exchange is clear  and suggesting that it indicates inappropriate pressure is inaccurate  The idea s existence was revealed as Mr  Trump and Mr  Miller have begun to purge the immigration agencies of officials they believe have not worked aggressively enough to prevent the surge of migrants at the border and to advance the president s hard line immigration agenda In addition to Mr  Vitiello  Mr  Trump pushed out Kirstjen Nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  and Claire Grady  the acting deputy secretary of the department  The president also appears poised to oust two other top immigration officials at the department in the

PARIS   The International Criminal Court abandoned a possible Afghanistan war crimes investigation on Friday  saying the United States and others in the conflict would not cooperate The court s chief prosecutor had long sought permission to open a formal inquiry into civilian killings  torture and other abuses in the Afghanistan war  including possible crimes by American forces  But a panel of the court s judges decided that the difficulties of obtaining evidence and witness testimony outweighed the benefits of a prosecution  with a low prospect of any convictions The decision was welcomed by the Trump administration and came just weeks after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would deny visas to the court s staff and judges involved in prosecuting or ruling on war crimes involving Americans  Last week the State Department confirmed that the United States visa of the court s chief prosecutor  Fatou Bensouda  had been revoked But the decision by the judges  which took nearly 18 months to reach  troubled lawyers and stunned human rights activists  who said the court had capitulated to what they called Trump administration intimidation and pressure that had weakened the court s credibility  With its decision today  the International Criminal Court sends a dangerous message  that bullying wins and that the powerful won t be held to account   said Katherine Gallagher  a senior staff lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York While Ms  Bensouda s office said she was considering her options  including a possible appeal of the judges  decision  it appeared to dim any hopes of accountability for abuses committed in the Afghanistan conflict  including torture of detainees by C I A  operatives at secret prisons known as  black sites  An announcement from the court said the judges had decided that the impediments to securing evidence and obtaining cooperation meant that  an investigation into the situation in Afghanistan at this stage would not serve the interests of justice  While the judges said that there was a  reasonable basis  to conclude crimes had been committed and that the court had jurisdiction   the current circumstances of the situation in Afghanistan are such as to make the prospects for a successful investigation and prosecution extremely limited  The White House issued a statement by Mr  Trump praising the decision  coupled with a reiteration of the longstanding United States position that the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction to prosecute any Americans  including those who served in Afghanistan or elsewhere  This is a major international victory   Mr  Trump said   not only for these patriots  but for the rule of law   He said the United States  holds American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards  The court s judges said the lack of cooperation so far by all sides   including the United States  the Afghan authorities and the Taliban   meant that pursuing a successful investigation and prosecution would be a poor use of the court s resources Nonetheless  human rights advocates assailed the decision as a startling retreat from the court s purpose of providing war crimes victims with a means of seeking justice  Some said the language of the court s decision masked what was effectively a capitulation to the United States Jamil Dakwar  director of the Human Rights Program at the American Civil Liberties Union  said it was  outrageous that victims of war crimes are far less likely to get justice for well documented atrocities because of the Trump administration s authoritarian efforts to sabotage an investigation before it could even get started  Mr  Dakwar said the administration was  playing a dangerous game  that had severe implications for other prosecutions by the court  No one except the world s most brutal regimes win when we weaken and sabotage international institutions established to fight impunity and hold human rights abusers accountable   he said The retreat on Afghanistan compounds the litany of setbacks that has confronted the court  Burundi and the Philippines have withdrawn from the treaty that created the court nearly two decades ago  Ms  Bensouda was forced to drop a case against Kenya s leaders in 2014 for lack of cooperation The just ousted president of Sudan  Omar Hassan al Bashir  has been wanted by the court on charges including genocide for a decade  but the generals who toppled him said Friday they will not extradite him ImageFatou Bensouda  center  chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court  during a visit last year to the Democratic Republic of Congo CreditJohn Wessels Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMs  Bensouda requested authorization from the judges in November 2017 to begin a formal investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity that followed the American led invasion of Afghanistan in early 2002 to rout the Al Qaeda plotters of the Sept  11  2001 attacks and the Taliban rulers who had sheltered them While Ms  Bensouda s inquiry would have mostly focused on large scale crimes against civilians attributed to the Taliban and Afghan government forces  it also would have examined accusations of abuses by the C I A  and American military personnel including actions at secret C I A  detention centers in Afghanistan  Poland  Lithuania and Romania In a clear reference to the black sites  contained in the decision by the judges to abandon the investigation  they wrote that Ms  Bensouda had wanted to look at how C I A  agents  mistreated  prisoners  allegedly with a view to forcing confessions  obtaining information or retaliating for  the 9 11 attacks The prosecutor  they wrote  argued there was  a reasonable basis to believe that  since May 2003  members of the U S  armed forces and the C I A  have committed the war crimes of torture and cruel treatment  outrages upon personal dignity  and rape and other forms of sexual violence pursuant to a policy approved by the U S  authorities  The judges wrote that the prosecutor relied on studies conducted by the Pentagon and Congress  notably by the Senate s Intelligence Committee  an apparent reference to the public portion of the so called Senate Torture Report that studied the C I A  s black site program The judges also wrote that the prosecutor submitted material that appeared to catalog violations of international law by the C I A   including inflicting  extremely cruel  brutal and gruesome  physical and mental pain on its captives  refusing to let captives sleep  eat  drink and pray  as well as shaming captives through  acts of a sexual nature  Although the United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court  established nearly two decades ago  American governments have cooperated  or at least not interfered  with the court on some of its work in other investigations Americans suspected of having committed crimes in countries that are members of the court are potentially subject to prosecution  Afghanistan  Poland  Lithuania and Romania are all members Param Preet Singh  associate director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch  called the court s decision a  devastating blow  to victims  The judges  logic effectively allows states to opt out on their obligation to cooperate with the court s investigation   she said   This sends a dangerous message to perpetrators that they can put themselves beyond the reach of the law just by being uncooperative  Guenael Metraux  a Swiss scholar who has also appeared before international tribunals in The Hague  said the court s decision was self destructive to its own authority  Judicially  this is the closest thing to a suicide   he said   It s a catastrophically misguided surrender of responsibilities that will be painted by the U S  administration as a resounding victory and perceived by others as a model on how to resist the court  He said the judges had effectively affirmed the view of critics who argue that the court only prosecutes those too weak to stand up to it Some legal experts  however  said the judges had made a sensible decision by foreseeing frustration and failure in prosecuting a case in which all the major parties were not cooperating  The perception will be that the court cowed to Washington  but the judges are being realistic   said Alex Whiting  a former American prosecutor at the court who now teaches at Harvard Law School He said that lessons drawn from recent setbacks and failed cases at the court showed it must focus on situations where it can succeed   The prosecution has already come to that realization and now the judges are too   he said For John R  Bolton  the president s national security adviser  who has painted the court as a transnational institution that infringes American sovereignty  the retreat on Friday was a major victory During the George W  Bush administration  Mr  Bolton led the charge for the United States to  un sign  the Rome Statute  which created the court   an event he later described as his happiest day in government  Today is my second happiest day in government   Mr  Bolton said

DETROIT   A U S  auto safety group wants the government to investigate automatic emergency braking on some Nissan Rogue SUVs  alleging that the safety feature makes the vehicles brake even when there s no emergency The nonprofit Center for Auto Safety filed a petition with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration seeking the probe  The group says about 675 000 Rogues from the 2017 and 2018 model years should be recalled Nissan says it has notified all customers of a software update that improves performance of the automated braking system  But the center says the campaigns don t acknowledge the seriousness of the safety problem and give owners little incentive to get the SUVs fixed In a letter posted Friday by the government  center Executive Director Jason Levine says it found 87 complaints about unintended braking in the safety administration s database   Many complaints indicate that braking is abrupt or forceful  endangering both the Rogue occupants as well as people in the vehicles nearby who are forced to avoid a collision with a suddenly stopped vehicle   the letter says Automatic emergency braking uses cameras and radar to slow or stop vehicles when drivers don t take action  The technology has great potential to save lives  but it also can develop glitches  Twenty automakers representing 99 percent of U S  new car sales signed a voluntary agreement with the government to make the feature standard on all light vehicles by Sept  1  2022 In its petition  the center said that according to the complaints  the Nissan braking system can be triggered by railroad tracks  traffic lights  bridges  parking structures  and other fixed objects that do not pose a threat to the vehicle  In an email  Levine said a recall is needed rather than Nissan s service campaign because false activation of the braking system is a safety hazard  He wrote that some drivers are turning off the technology because of the problem NHTSA said in documents that it will evaluate whether to grant or deny the center s petition  Safety advocates and vehicle owners can petition the government to open safety investigations Nissan said it will continue to work with NHTSA and Canadian safety regulators on all matters of product safety

WASHINGTON   As President Donald Trump rails against an influx of migrants at the border  two of his most influential White House power players are at odds over the future of his immigration policy Fresh off orchestrating a shake up at the Department of Homeland Security  an ascendant Stephen Miller is making a renewed push to impose tougher policies at the border  That s setting up a face off with senior adviser and presidential son in law Jared Kushner  who has been quietly working on his own immigration reform package for months Their divergent approaches to the president s signature campaign issue speak to more than the ideological gulf between the two men  They echo a long standing philosophical divide within the West Wing over how to best position the president ahead of his re election campaign Miller  the mastermind of the president s Muslim travel ban and other hard line immigration policies  has long been the combative ideologue  urging Trump to take ever more drastic action to stanch the border flow  Kushner  whose faith in his own careful dealmaking power rivals Miller s zeal  has spent months meeting with lawmakers and interest groups  trying to put together a package of legal immigration and border security changes that Republicans can rally around heading into the 2020 presidential election The resulting parallel tracks   one bent on implementing ever stricter policies and another meant to forge a more palatable and unifying legislative package   have created uncertainty and confusion both inside the administration and on Capitol Hill about where Trump is headed The conflict came into focus during a recent White House meeting when Trump effectively knighted Miller  saying the aide would oversee immigration going forward  But Kushner had already been tasked by the president with coming up with a legal immigration plan  which Trump was briefed on this week  We ll talk to you about it soon   Trump said Wednesday of Kushner s plan  labeling it  very exciting  very important for the country  Despite the aides  differing approaches  administration officials insist there is no ill will between Kushner and Miller  who have worked together over the years at the White House and on Trump s campaign  The two are among the last remaining members of Trump s tightknit 2016 team to still work at the White House and have been longtime collaborators  co writing speeches  including the president s convention address But for all that  the two hold fundamentally different views on immigration and notions on how Trump ought to govern Miller  the unrelenting hard liner  sees illegal and legal immigration as existential threats to national security and the American worker  and views Trump as a generational voice willing to make dramatic changes  Kushner  a former Democratic leaning real estate developer  sees a broken immigration system as another intractable Washington problem that could be solved with the right deal That leaves them working at cross purposes at times After Trump threatened to shut down the southern border two weeks ago  Kushner was among those whom Homeland Security officials worked with to get the president to back off  Indeed  Kushner is seen within the department as someone who accepts the realities of legal limitations and can be trusted to calm Trump down  not spin him up  as they feel Miller tends to do on immigration  according to three administration officials with knowledge of the dynamic  They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations Senior administration officials have tried to paint Miller and Kushner s efforts as complementary   Miller addressing the day to day crisis at the border while Kushner looking at longer term solutions  President Trump alone sets immigration policy that s designed to solve the humanitarian crisis at our border  prevent illegal entry into our country and protect the American people   there s no daylight between the president s team as they work to implement that agenda   spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement Trump on Wednesday also challenged the notion that anyone was running his immigration policy other than him Asked by reporters whether he had considered tapping Miller to lead Homeland Security  Trump said   Stephen is an excellent guy  He s wonderful person   But  he added   Frankly  there s only one person that s running it  You know who that is  It s me  But former officials said the absence of clear lines of authority and the recent purge of senior leadership at Homeland Security could create confusion  leaving the agency to implement whichever viewpoint wins the day  To whom are we listening  Who s setting the priorities   said David Lapan  the department s former press secretary Thad Bingel a former senior Homeland Security official  who helped shepherd outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen through her confirmation process  echoed those concerns  saying that when it s not clear who s in charge at the White House  departments and subagencies  spin their wheels a lot trying to satisfy multiple masters  Raising the stakes further is that Kushner is no mere White House aide   he s the president s son in law and has proven capable of forcing staff turnover at the highest level  He was instrumental in the departure of two chiefs of staff and the president s former chief strategist Kushner s latest efforts on immigration date to early January  when Trump asked him to pursue a deal with lawmakers that would win the president more money for his border wall during the government shutdown While White House officials caution that the plan has yet to be finalized  aides said it would include  merit based  changes to the legal immigration system as well as proposals on border security that could include modernizing ports of entry and changing the way the country detains and removes people who enter the country illegally As part of that effort  Kushner has convened a series of informal listening sessions with almost 50 groups  including anti immigration advocates  business and conservative groups coming together to talk through ideas  It was the same playbook he used last year on criminal justice reform  which culminated in the only major piece of bipartisan legislation the president has signed During those meetings  Kushner was been careful not to tip his hat on his personal views  But participants say they expect the plan to include significant changes  including increases in employment based green cards  While protections for the hundreds of thousands of so called Dreamers brought to the country illegally as children were a major point of discussion  a senior administration official said Dreamers are not currently part of the plan Jessica Vaughn  director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies  which advocates for lower immigration levels  cautioned that unveiling a major plan now would be a distraction from the immediate border crisis  The timing couldn t be worse   she said   It s just the wrong time to be getting into a battle over this when the priority should be on fixing the border crisis and getting our enforcement on track     Associated Press writer Colleen Long contributed to this report

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  facing criticism that the Trump administration has sought to sweep away the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi s brutal killing  announced on Monday that 16 Saudis  including one of the closest aides to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  were being barred from entry to the United States The list included the close aide  Saud al Qahtani  who officially served as the royal court s media czar  but appeared to have overseen the operation to seize Mr  Khashoggi  It was one of a dozen or so operations by what American intelligence officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group  set up by Mr  al Qahtani to silence or eliminate dissent about Prince Mohammed s rapid rise to become the de facto Saudi leader But conspicuously missing from the list is Prince Mohammed himself  despite the conclusion by American intelligence agencies that he was ultimately responsible for sending the team to Istanbul to kill Mr  Khashoggi  and for other actions by the Rapid Intervention Group  More than a year before Mr  Khashoggi s death  American intelligence officials intercepted a communication from the crown prince saying that if Mr  Khashoggi  a Washington Post journalist who lived in Virginia  did not voluntarily return to the kingdom and cease publishing his criticism  the state should go after him  with a bullet  Based on the findings of the C I A   which he led until last year  Mr  Pompeo would have been free to add the crown prince to the list  though that would have been an unusual move to take against a leader of a close ally  But Mr  Pompeo has at times also sounded passive about the investigation  saying he was giving the Saudis time to complete their own inquiry By moving to name the Saudis and barring them and their immediate families from traveling to the United States  the Trump administration appears to be trying to tamp down an unusual uprising in Congress that has involved members of both parties But it is far from clear that the relatively minor penalty  against Saudis who would be unlikely to enter the United States under current conditions  will be viewed as sufficient  Mr  Pompeo and President Trump are likely to still face the accusation that they are deliberately ignoring the C I A  s intelligence findings in an effort to put the killing behind them  Mr  Trump once called the report about the crown prince s involvement a  feeling  by the C I A   and has insisted that the evidence is not conclusive VideoAn autopsy expert  A lookalike  A black van  Our video investigation follows the movements of the 15 man Saudi hit team that killed and dismembered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi It is unclear whether their effort to move on from the killing will work  Congress has already moved to stop all American support for Saudi military action in Yemen  and there are questions about continued military transfers  And Mr  Trump s administration has been negotiating for two years now on a deal to sell civilian nuclear power designs and equipment to Saudi Arabia  an action that would require congressional approval and raises concerns about whether the Saudi government might use the technology to seek a nuclear weapon  The crown prince has been explicit that if Iran got a weapon  Saudi Arabia would as well The administration regards Saudi Arabia as its key partner in confronting Iran The announcement appeared timed to generate little news and less embarrassment for the Saudi crown prince  Mr  Pompeo s list was published Monday evening  on a day in which upheavals at the Department of Homeland Security and Mr  Pompeo s decision to name the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a foreign terrorist organization dominated headlines  Mr  Pompeo had appeared at the State Department press room and took questions on the Iranian designation earlier Monday  making no mention of the approaching announcement on Saudi Arabia One American diplomat involved in Saudi affairs who was not authorized to speak on the subject said the decision to act had taken considerable time The Saudis have never publicly talked about the whereabouts of Mr  al Qahtani  who was the crown prince s chief enforcer and one of the architects of the effort to consolidate his power  In private  Saudis say he is under house arrest  But there is no indication whether he is being criminally prosecuted  and some reports indicated that he continued to hold power until the investigation became too hot  and someone near the crown prince had to take the fall The list of barred Saudis also included several members of the team sent to Istanbul  where Mr  Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi Consulate in an encounter that the Saudis insist was intended to forcibly bring him back to Riyadh  the Saudi capital  It includes the leader of that team  Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb  an intelligence officer who knew Mr  Khashoggi from their days working together at the Saudi Embassy in London  He often traveled with the crown prince abroad Mr  Mutreb and another Saudi listed by the State Department  Thaar Ghaleb al Harbi  a member of the royal guard and a favorite of the crown prince s for his role in fighting off an attack on one of Prince Mohammed s palaces  are standing trial  Saudi officials have told The New York Times Also listed was Salah Tubaigy  whom The Washington Post recently identified as a  medical specialist  for the Saudi Interior Ministry who is said to have administered a powerful sedative to Mr  Khashoggi during a struggle inside the consulate  He died shortly thereafter  perhaps because of the sedative  or his asthma  or because of strangulation His body was cut up and has never been recovered Much of the evidence against the men named in the State Department s list came from Turkey  which had surveillance videos outside the consulate and had apparently bugged the consulate itself  resulting in an audio recording of the killing  

WASHINGTON   It could take the U S  government up to two years to identify potentially thousands of additional children separated from their parents by the authorities at the southern border  the government said in a court filing The filing late on Friday outlined for the first time the Trump administration s plan for identifying which family members might have been separated by assessing thousands of records using a combination of data analysis  statistical science  and manual review Last month  a federal judge in San Diego expanded the number of migrant families that the government may be required to reunite as part of a class action lawsuit brought last year by the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  The Office of Inspector General at the U S  Department of Health and Human Services said earlier this year that the agency had identified many more children in addition to the 2 737 initially included in the suit  U S  District Court Judge Dana Sabraw had already ordered that those children be reunited with their parents  Defendants estimate that identifying all possible children     would take at least 12 months  and possibly up to 24 months   the government wrote in Friday s filing  It added that the time frame would be affected by the efficacy of its predictive statistical model  the manpower it can dedicate to the manual review  and any follow up meetings required In a statement on Saturday  the ACLU s lead attorney for the case  Lee Gelernt  said the group strongly opposed the government s proposed plan and accused it of not treating the separations with the necessary urgency  The government was able to quickly gather resources to tear these children away from their families and now they need to gather the resources to fix the damage   Gelernt said President Donald Trump s administration implemented a  zero tolerance  policy to criminally prosecute and jail all illegal border crossers  even those traveling with their children  leading to a wave of separations last year  The policy sparked outrage when it became public  and the backlash led Trump to sign an executive order reversing course on June 20  2018   Reporting by Kristina Cooke and Yeganeh Torbati  Writing by Michelle Price  Editing by Daniel Wallis  

RIO DE JANEIRO   President Jair Bolsonaro s first 100 days in office have been marked by infighting in his administration  insults to adversaries and allies  praise for Brazil s 1964 1985 dictatorship and a scarcity of bills passed by Congress   pretty much the same as his record as a congressman and as a candidate So far  the anti corruption and pro gun outsider who is frequently compared to U S  President Donald Trump has scored only a few major victories to keep his far right base excited Bolsonaro s electoral triumph in October sent Brazil s left to its biggest defeat in almost two decades  But for many  so far Bolsonaro s administration is heavy on discourse and light on concrete accomplishments Bolsonaro has achieved some of his campaign promises  He signed a decree easing restrictions on gun ownership as an anti crime move  privatized some state run companies  installed a Cabinet with eight members of the military   more than at any time since the restoration of democracy   and has built strong ties with Trump and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu while distancing Brazil from Venezuela s socialist leader  Nicolas Maduro He has also begun moves to weaken environmental restrictions on development  as promised Still  as he marks off his 100th day in the presidency Wednesday  he has also given critics a lot of material to work with  and corruption suspicions against the president s family have emerged The former army captain has been widely criticized for celebrating the March 31  1964  coup that launched Brazil s military regime and for labeling Nazism as a leftist ideology while in Jerusalem  He managed to offend even allies with a pornographic tweet of a Carnival party in response to revelers who had mocked him What is widely seen as his most crucial challenge  fixing the country s costly pension system   remains trapped in Congress with other proposals  including a highly touted revamp of the anti crime and anti corruption systems During 27 years in Congress  Bolsonaro was noted for inflammatory speeches but presented only two bills that became law  This administration is characterized by strong rhetoric that is not necessarily supported by actions in the same direction   said Renato Flores  an analyst with the Rio based Fundacao Getulio Vargas think tank Some once staunch supporters of the president now worry about the role he gives to his sons Carlos  Eduardo and Flavio  Criticism by Carlos helped prompt the resignation of Bolsonaro s aide and attorney Gustavo Bebianno  Eduardo alarmed some by tweeting that the president would need only  one soldier and one corporal  to deal with the Supreme Court Bolsonaro s Cabinet appears to be divided into four  sometimes fractious factions  the military  with eight out of 22 ministers  evangelical conservatives who control the government s human rights agenda  a moderate wing overseeing economic and justice ministries  and a cluster of anti globalist fans of Olavo de Carvalho  a far right Brazilian writer who lives in the United States  now dominate foreign relations and education Carlos Melo  a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo  said the divisions put Bolsonaro s administration  in paralysis from the start   There are too many conflicts  We can t see a proper plan to grow the economy and Bolsonaro is losing the momentum presidents have in the first six months  Even his pension reform  which led many moderates to believe him  seems at risk of failing or being massively dehydrated by the very Congress he doesn t talk to   Melo said   It can all change  he has time  But the signs are not here yet  Even lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia  who initially had good relations with Bolsonaro  has complained that the far right leader is  playing at being Brazil s president   Now it is time for us to stop joking around and it is time that he sits on his chair that Congress sits here and we solve Brazil s problems together   Maia said last month The public also seems restless  The Datafolha polling institute reported Sunday that Bolsonaro s approval rating has slipped to 32   the lowest for any elected first term Brazilian president  though still far above the single digit approval rating his predecessor  Michel Temer  had at the end Datafolha interviewed 2 086 people April 2 3 and reported a two  percentage point margin of error Business leaders and stockbrokers initially welcomed Bolsonaro s victory  but so far there has been little sign of economic improvement  Unemployment officially is still at 12   a record 4 9 million Brazilians stopped searching for jobs in March and an initial stock market rally was erased following some of the president s Twitter made rifts with allies  The government research institute recently reduced its 2019 economic growth expectations from 2 7  to 2  Bolsonaro  who likes to say he is pushing ideology out of Brazil s foreign affairs  has shifted the country s alliances toward other leaders who share his conservative tendencies  joining in regional efforts to isolate Venezuela s Maduro He has been hosted in Trump s White House and in Netanyahu s Jerusalem  but China  Brazil s biggest trading partner  has been shunned  Agribusiness leaders fear that approach could harm Brazilian exports to Asia Vice President Hamilton Mourao has tried to soften that stance  calling China a partner and meeting with Chinese diplomats The man once hailed as an anti corruption hero by supporters is facing suspicions of familial wrongdoing Regulatory authorities said his son Flavio  who is also a senator  received 48 suspicious payments totaling about  25 000 in a single month from his former driver Fabricio Queiroz  who also made a payment to first lady Michelle Bolsonaro of about  5 500  All involved deny any wrongdoing  An investigation is ongoing None of those difficulties have alienated Bolsonaro s hardcore supporters  like 60 year old hairdresser Roberta Duarte  Bolsonaro is doing what he promised  No other president did this in more than 50 years  He is putting the house in order  fighting crime and violence   said Duarte  who lives in a violent region in the south of Sao Paulo   Violence was so strong that no one could leave at night to watch a movie or eat a pizza  Slowly things are improving  Others  like 18 year old journalism student Lucas Batista  are worried by Bolsonaro s frequent nods to Brazil s military dictatorship when his administration comes under criticism  He is an authoritarian leader who believes he is the only one capable of solving the country s problems   Batista said   I fear Bolsonaro and his followers want to reintroduce a military regime     Associated Press writer Marcelo Silva de Sousa reported this story in Rio de Janeiro

WASHINGTON   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s vow for Israel to annex parts of the West Bank would flout four decades of American policy  under both Republican and Democratic presidents  But nothing emboldened Mr  Netanyahu to take such a risk more than the support of his ally President Trump From recognizing Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights to moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem  Mr  Trump has given Mr  Netanyahu the political cover and legal legitimacy to embrace a position that critics say would all but extinguish the dream of a viable Palestinian state Mr  Trump s moves are not merely temporary gestures  which a future president or Israeli leader could reverse  They are policy changes that experts say have permanently altered the contested landscape of the Middle East  making his own stated goal of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians more unattainable than ever  They talk about a peace plan  but we never see it   said Martin S  Indyk  a former American ambassador to Israel who tried to negotiate a deal between Israel and the Palestinians during the Obama administration   What we see are new facts on the ground that will make a two state solution impossible  The White House declined to comment on Monday on Mr  Netanyahu s latest remarks  Partly  this reflected qualms about speaking out on a delicate diplomatic issue on the eve of an Israeli election  But it also revealed the extent to which Mr  Trump has become Mr  Netanyahu s biggest enabler ImageLabourers at a construction site in Beitar Illit  an Israeli settlement in the West Bank CreditRonen Zvulun ReutersFor Mr  Trump  who has talked about brokering a  deal of the century  between Israel and the Palestinians  Mr  Netanyahu s aggressive move could pose a long term problem  There is no obvious alternative to a two state solution  however bleak its prospects  If Mr  Netanyahu is re elected and follows through on his promise to annex territory  it would force the United States to retire a diplomatic strategy that dates to President Richard M  Nixon Mr  Trump continues to promote the idea of a peace accord  placing his hope in a blueprint drafted by three of his senior aides  Jared Kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  Jason D  Greenblatt  his special envoy for Middle East peace  and David M  Friedman  the American ambassador to Israel  The Trump administration  officials said  still intends to present the plan sometime after the Israeli election  A big thing for me  and some of you won t like this maybe  but I would love to see peace in the Middle East   Mr  Trump said Saturday at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas   If those three can t do it  you ll never have it done  The setting captured the tension between Mr  Trump s diplomatic ambitions and his domestic political imperatives  Acknowledging that the audience might not welcome a peacemaking effort that required compromises by Israel  he spent most of his time taking credit for decisions like the Jerusalem embassy and Golan Heights  which are popular with right wing Jews and evangelical voters In Israel  meanwhile  Mr  Netanyahu suggested that he had the tacit backing of Mr  Trump to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank  The prime minister told Israeli news media over the weekend that the White House was aware of his plans and said that he hoped to  do it  if possible  with American support   though he added that he would not change his position  regardless of how the United States reacted ImageMembers of Iran s Revolutionary Guards Corps on parade in Tehran last year CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesThere was little in Washington s silence to indicate that Mr  Netanyahu would face pushback  At every step of the prime minister s hard fought campaign to stay in power  Mr  Trump has tried to help him  The president s announcement on the Golan Heights last month came at a critical moment  when Mr  Netanyahu faced a rising opponent and damaging new disclosures in the corruption cases against him Even Mr  Trump s announcement on Monday that the State Department would designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a foreign terrorist organization paid dividends for Mr  Netanyahu  On his Hebrew language Twitter feed  Mr  Netanyahu thanked Mr  Trump for  keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism  Mr  Trump has wrapped Mr  Netanyahu in a warm embrace from the beginning of his presidency  even as he has voiced mild support for a two state solution   That s what I think works best   he said last fall during a meeting with the prime minister at the United Nations General Assembly While Mr  Trump s moves have been unstintingly pro Israel  some could also be interpreted as a way to pressure the Palestinians to come back to the bargaining table  The administration cut off aid to Palestinian groups  closed its diplomatic office in Washington and ended funding for a United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees None of that persuaded the Palestinians to reopen a dialogue with the United States that was cut off after Mr  Trump announced the embassy move in late 2017  The threat of annexation  experts said  might be the last form of leverage the United States has over the Palestinians  Unless they agree to a peace deal  the United States could give Mr  Netanyahu a green light to claim territory ImageIsraeli tourists watching the Syrian side of the border in the Golan Heights last month CreditAtef Safadi EPA  via Shutterstock The one issue that clearly opened a Pandora s box was the Golan Heights announcement   said Ghaith al Omari  a former Palestinian negotiator   Once they broke that particular taboo  they opened the door for all the annexationists in Israel to say   Now go for the West Bank   Whatever his election eve theatrics  some analysts argue that Mr  Netanyahu would be loath to take such a radical step  They say he is motivated less by a desire to upend decades of diplomacy than by his own political survival  Dangling the prospect of annexation is a way to nail down the support of smaller right wing parties  which he will need to form a government  He s smart enough to realize that if he goes through with this  he is creating with his own hands a Bosnia on the Mediterranean   said David Makovsky  a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy But Mr  Makovsky acknowledged that if the Trump administration presented its plan and was rebuffed by the Palestinians   a scenario he and other veterans of peace negotiations view as likely   Mr  Netanyahu could use that as a pretext for selective annexation of large settlements Mr  Trump s aides have kept a tight lid on the details and timing of their plan  Some analysts speculated that they might introduce it after the election  but before the victor forms a government  so as to influence the makeup of the new coalition  That scenario now seems less likely  given Mr  Netanyahu s weakened position  because he will probably have to reach out to right wing parties to form a government   and none of those are interested in a Palestinian state Some former diplomats argue that the intense focus on the peace plan misses the point  The Trump administration has utterly transformed the paradigm for American engagement in the Middle East  What we re watching in terms of American policy is a shell game   said Daniel C  Kurtzer  a former American ambassador to Israel and Egypt   They want you to watch the peace plan   it s 40 pages long  it s 60 pages long  What they don t want you to watch is how they are trying extraordinarily hard  under cover of the plan  to change things on the ground   

WASHINGTON   U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday told lawmakers the Trump administration is preparing for the possibility of a  hard Brexit   I think at this point we need to be prepared for a hard Brexit as a very realistic outcome   Mnuchin said at a hearing of the U S  House Committee on Financial Services  The United States is monitoring the developments around United Kingdom s exit from the European Union and has been working with regulators to prepare for any market or trade disruptions  he said    Reporting by Chris Prentice  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama  

SAN DIEGO TIJUANA  Mexico   At least 60 Central American asylum seekers who were waiting in Mexico for their cases to be heard have been allowed to stay in the United States since Monday s court ruling to halt a Trump administration policy of sending them back across the border The admissions occurred even though the U S  District Court ruling does not come into effect until Friday  and despite the fact the ruling does not clearly apply to the hundreds of people returned to Mexico  The number and outcomes of the cases were confirmed by a migrant attorney and a Reuters reporter who have attended court proceedings in San Diego this week  The administration has indicated it will appeal the ruling  and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether there has been a policy change But the stance of the DHS in the cases in a San Diego court shows the U S  government is already allowing some migrants coming in from Mexico to stay in the United States as their individual cases come up A source at Mexico s National Immigration Institute said on Thursday that around 1 400 people have been returned to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols policy  MPP  since January  most of them to the border town of Tijuana  where many said they feared dangerous conditions The policy was stepped up in the days before the ruling  Mexican government statistics show  No one appears to have been sent back under the policy since Tuesday  the day after the ruling  said the Mexican immigration source  who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media The court ruling clearly applied to the 11 plaintiffs in the civil liberties lawsuit as well as future asylum applicants  but the status of those already in Mexico was left unclear  Not one of 20 asylum seekers who crossed the border from Tijuana on Wednesday for court hearings in San Diego was returned to Mexico  however  At one hearing  a Guatemalan man asked specifically whether he would have to go back to Tijuana  Definitely  he will not be returned to Mexico   said Pamela Ataii  the DHS lawyer  Another migrant told Judge Scott Simpson that he was scared to go back  to which Simpson responded   You are lucky  because I don t think that s going to happen  Luis Gonzalez  supervising immigration attorney with the Jewish Family Service of San Diego  who attended court on Tuesday  said he knew of 13 people who had hearings that day who had been released and one who was detained in the United States   Our understanding so far is that families under the MPP program are now being released into the United States after coming to court   Gonzalez said El Salvadoran Gabriela Orellana  26  and her two children were among those allowed to pursue their cases in the United States  I am here  thank God  in a shelter in San Diego   she said in a telephone interview on Thursday President Donald Trump s administration has argued that asylum seekers who are released into U S  territory often do not show up at their hearings  a contention at odds with federal statistics which show that the majority do appear Carmen Rivera  who said she was fleeing gangs in El Salvador  had given up hope of receiving U S  asylum after she was sent back to Mexico  She told Reuters she decided weeks ago not to attend her court hearing in San Diego After the ruling this week  however  she changed her mind  I m excited to know that we have this opportunity  because to return to Mexico  to Tijuana  is very dangerous   she said from a shelter close to the border fence in Mexico  where many migrants were camped out in tents   Thank God  things changed     Additional reporting by Andrew Hay  writing by Kristina Cooke  Editing by Julie Marquis and Sonya Hepinstall
