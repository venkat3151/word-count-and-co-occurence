Donald Trump s lie filled rage tweets about Puerto Rico this week over disaster aid continue a Trump pattern that mirrors a method that white supremacists have used throughout American history  Particularly present since Reconstruction  this method involves proclaiming that minorities lack the character and capacity to create effective government  and therefore minority led jurisdictions are a hopeless drain on resources He tweeted that Puerto Rico s government  can t do anything right  and that the island s politicians are  incompetent or corrupt  and only  complain and ask for more money   which they spend  foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA   He specifically called the mayor of San Juan  crazed and incompetent  Point of fact  Puerto Rico is part of the United States  It is a territory  Its citizens are U S  citizens  The structure of Trump s comments leaves open the possibility that he doesn t know that  or conversely  knows it but doesn t fully accept it or care about it If this were a one off spat with politicians opposed to his conduct  one might reasonably write Trump s comments off as politics as usual  Instead  this questioning of the competence of black and brown leaders is not anomaly but motif Trump has spent nearly a decade now trying to paint Barack Obama as not only an illegitimate president  but also as an inept  lazy  embarrassing one  He has called him a  sick    weak    incompetent leader  with a  horrible attitude  who  looks and sounds so ridiculous    has disastrous judgment   is  a total failure  and was  perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States  Worse than the white supremacist Andrew Johnson  who did his best to obstruct Reconstruction  opposed the 14th Amendment and was impeached  Worse than Trump s slave owning hero Andrew Jackson  whose Indian Removal Act led to the Trail of Tears  Worse than slave owning John Tyler  who during his time in Congress argued against the Missouri Compromise  which would restrain the spread of the  peculiar institution   Worse than Millard Fillmore  who backed the protection of Southern slavery in the Compromise of 1850  which delayed Southern secession  Worse than Richard Nixon  who was forced from office  Worse than George W  Bush  who lied this country into the war in Iraq  Worse than Trump himself Let s submit that Trump has in some ways been an equal opportunity offender and gone after all his political opponents to some degree   he incessantly called Hillary Clinton  crooked  and Bernie Sanders  crazy  Still  that doesn t fully account for the particular consistency with which he attacks minority leaders and minority led entities as inadequate  ineffective and incompetent According to Trump  former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was  totally unqualified  and would  destroy  the state of Georgia  Abrams is a star  and the way that state s election was handled will do more to destroy it than Abrams ever could According to Trump  former Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum was  a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee  said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country   There is no evidence of theft by Gillum  and Tallahassee isn t the most corrupt city According to Trump  legendary Congressman John Lewis s district  is in horrible shape and falling apart   It is not  PolitiFact rated Trump s claim  mostly false  Even majority black and majority brown countries around the globe have been condemned and dismissed by Trump in this way  Haiti  El Salvador and African countries are  shithole countries   Mexico has a  totally corrupt gov t   and it is sending  animals  and  rapists  across the border Yet he has lobbed praise at strongmen   mostly in Europe and Asia   for being great leaders  Think Russia and North Korea  Western nations have also piqued his anger when they have not been sufficiently ruthless with their minority populations  He said that Britain was  trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem   and Germany  is going through massive attacks to its people by the migrants allowed to enter the country   But Trump still maintains  a great feeling for Germany   That feeling is apparently so great that he keeps lying that his father  Fred Trump  was born there  like he did again this week  Fred Trump was born in New York  To me  this marking of minorities as incapable of good governance harkens back to the Reconstruction period  when white supremacists promoted racist caricatures of newly elected black legislators acting uncouth as a way to fuel an angry backlash  This shows up in newspaper illustrations and in the film  The Birth of a Nation   in which black legislators   eating  drinking and some without shoes   are shown in a state of chaos These white supremacists  many wealthy and powerful  used the threat of  black domination  to scare poorer whites into allegiance  warning them of race mixing  miscegenation and the rape of white women and girls  They also warned about the crude attempt of black people to be civilized and judicious This is very similar to what Trump tweeted this week  trying to pit suffering farmers in the Midwest against suffering Puerto Rican hurricane survivors Trump tweeted that  Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane  more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before  That  of course  was just another lie  As The New York Times reported In fact  FEMA and other agencies have so far distributed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion in aid has been allocated  while  91 billion is the budget office s estimate of how much the island could receive over the next two decades The farmers are mostly old  white men  As Modern Farmer pointed out in 2014 More than 92 percent of the country s 2 1 million farmers are non Hispanic whites  and more than 86 percent of those farm operators are men  The average age of farmers  which has been rising for decades  continued to inch up  In 2012  the average farmer was 58 3 years old  up from 57 1 years in 2007 Puerto Rico is 99 percent Hispanic Trump made his point clear  The mismanagement and incompetence of these brown people amount to stealing resources from these white people  As he tweeted   Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments  and so little appreciation  The brown people were supposed to be thankful that white daddy in  the States  was helping them at all  As Trump tweeted   The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J  Trump  This is the kind of paternalistic white supremacy that doesn t even require open hostility  although plenty often accompanies it  The logic goes this way  Everyone is better off  even minorities  when white people are in charge and calling the shots This is part of what drew so many white voters to Trump  whether they admit it or not  He promised to destroy  erase or replace everything President Obama had done  thereby fixing the glitch in the narrative that the only true and good leaders of America were white leaders  In the white supremacist imagination  even this horrendous white leader is better than the most educated  articulate and erudite black man That logic also says to people like the Puerto Ricans that even in their suffering  minorities are better off being part of this country This reminds me of a letter Robert E  Lee wrote to his wife in 1856 in which he said  The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa  morally  socially   physically  The painful discipline they are undergoing  is necessary for their instruction as a race  and I hope will prepare and lead them to better things  How long their subjugation may be necessary is known and ordered by a wise Merciful Providence  For all minorities in America  the subjugation continues  particularly now that Trump wants to dictate who is worthy of assistance and who should be allowed to suffer Trump Lashes Out Again at Puerto Rico  Bewildering the IslandApril 2  2019The Times is committed to publishing a

By threatening to close the border with Mexico and moving to cut off aid to El Salvador  Honduras and Guatemala   the so called Northern Triangle countries  from which many migrants headed to the United States are coming   President Trump is effectively shooting America in the foot  to paraphrase one expert Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection  noted last week that the near record number of migrant families with children seeking asylum both at and in between official ports of entry on the southern border was stretching his agency to a  breaking point   This was made startlingly clear as photos of hundreds of migrants  including many small children  confined behind razor wire in a makeshift enclosure beneath a bridge in El Paso  spread quickly across the internet  The agency has since closed the holding area ImageKevin McAleenan  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  speaking last week in El Paso about the impact of the increase in illegal crossings along the southwest border  CreditJose Luis Gonzalez ReutersC B P  and Immigration and Customs Enforcement  both of which operate under the Department of Homeland Security  have taken steps to grapple with the increased flow of migrants  a vast majority of them families with children seeking asylum  The agencies have diverted resources and personnel to process and care for the migrants  even agreeing to release some families to American cities far from the border  We are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a C B P  facility   Mr  McAleenan said   But with these numbers  with the types of illnesses we re seeing at the border  I fear that it s just a matter of time  In an attempt to ease the problem  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  signed a compact with officials from the Northern Triangle last week to help curb the complex drivers of irregular migration   including crime and gang violence in the region  Mr  Trump  less than a day later  announced he was ending aid to those countries  Nonsensically  Mr  Trump has insisted that the real problem is Mexico  which he suggested is doing  nothing  to help stop the tide of migrants  That s despite the efforts by Mexican leaders to intercept migrant groups  providing temporary visas to asylum seekers and allowing some making the trek north to remain in Mexico while they await court hearings in the United States As with the president s wall  which would do little to discourage unauthorized migration  let alone illegal drug trafficking  no one with a working knowledge of immigration policy believes that closing the border is a solution to the recent surge  The economic disruption for border communities and the impact on trade would be disastrous  Plus  closing the border won t stop migrants from stepping onto United States soil and claiming asylum  as many of the groups surrendering to border agents in recent months have done in between ports of entry What would help much more is action to address the root causes of the surge in border crossings  from reforming federal immigration laws to aid to improve economic conditions in Central America  And most urgently  Congress needs to come up with a more nimble legal framework to address the glut of asylum claims and more funding for log jammed immigration courts to process them  This moment calls for proactive measures   not incendiary policies that are destined to backfire RelatedMore on aid to Central America Trump Turns U S  Policy in Central America on Its HeadMarch 30  2019Opinion   Anita Isaacs and Anne PrestonWhat Trump Gets Wrong About Central American AidApril 1  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

WASHINGTON   President Trump acknowledged Tuesday that closing the southern border with Mexico could damage the United States economy  but said protecting America s security was more important than trade In remarks from the Oval Office  Mr  Trump reiterated his threat to shut the border if Mexico  America s third largest trading partner  cannot restrict a flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States  But the president s economic team  concerned about the damage from such a move  said it was looking for ways to limit the fallout if Mr  Trump does do so  Sure  it s going to have a negative impact on the economy   Mr  Trump said  adding   but security is most important   Security is more important to me than trade   he said Republican lawmakers  economists and business groups largely disagree with that assessment and warned this week that closing the border could cripple the flow of goods and workers and devastate American automakers and farmers  as well as other industries that depend on Mexico for sales and goods  Closing down the border would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country   Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  said in an interview   I would hope that we would not be doing that sort of thing  Mark Zandi  the chief economist at Moody s Analytics  said that  a full shutdown of the U S  Mexican border of more than several weeks would be the fodder for recessions in both Mexico and the U S  Mr  Trump s economic advisers have briefed him on the potential financial damage from a border shutdown and started looking for ways to mitigate it  including possibly keeping certain trading avenues open Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  said Tuesday in a brief interview that the Trump administration was trying to secure the border without harming the economy  The question is   he said   can we deal with that and not have any economic damage  I think the answer is we can  People are looking at different options  Mr  Kudlow added that the administration was  looking for ways to allow the freight passage   some people call it truck roads   There are ways you can do that  which would ameliorate the breakdown in supply chains   he said But business leaders say there is no way to contain the damage from even a partial shutdown of the 2 000 mile border that the United States shares with Mexico  Nearly  1 7 billion of goods and services flow across the border daily  as well as nearly a half million legal workers  students  shoppers and tourists  the U S  Chamber of Commerce said Monday On Tuesday  officials with the chamber called a partial border shutdown  uncharted territory  and said such a policy would have negative economic consequences  particularly for communities along the border  We don t know whether that is feasible or not   said Neil Bradley  the chamber s executive vice president and chief policy officer Even if it is possible  a partial shutdown would still cause significant disruptions for industries that are highly integrated across the border  including automobiles  machinery and electronic equipment  The North American auto industry will be crippled  in a week  Kristin Dziczek  a vice president for the Center for Automotive Research  an industry research group  said in a tweet Mr  Trump s pledge to close the border comes in response to what officials with the Department of Homeland Security say is an increase in migrant families who are flooding America s immigration system  leading to overflowing detention centers and mass releases of migrants The president told reporters that if Mexico cannot restrict the flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States  and if Congress cannot agree to several immigration restrictions that Mr  Trump has long pushed for   the border is going to be closed  While 76 000 migrants crossed the border in February  that number is nowhere near the migration levels seen in the early 2000s  And a majority of the migrants crossing the border now are Central American families looking for asylum  as opposed to Mexican individuals looking for work  Homeland security officials could quickly deport Mexican individuals seeking employment  but  by law  they cannot swiftly deport Central American families or unaccompanied children Homeland security officials have said they expect the number of crossings to surpass 100 000 this month  And a senior department official said those traveling in and out of ports of entry were already feeling an effect  There was a three hour wait at the port of entry in Brownsville  Tex   according to the official  and there were around 150 trucks backed up and waiting to cross at Otay Mesa  in California On Monday  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said she would divert up to 750 border patrol officials from ports of entry to areas in between the ports to handle large groups of migrants crossing the border  A senior homeland security official also said the administration could start closing traffic lanes at the ports  The crisis at our border is worsening   Ms  Nielsen said   and D H S  will do everything in its power to end it  Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina and one of Mr  Trump s external advisers  has been urging the president to ease off the threat  On Tuesday  Mr  Graham portrayed Mr  Trump s latest broadside as less an eventuality and more a calculated bargaining position  You are taking a bad problem and  by closing the ports of entry  you are creating another problem   he said during an interview   To the extent that he wants to redeploy resources to the points of entry to deal with the ungoverned spaces   that will create economic upheaval  but that will hopefully lead to a solution  Border activity makes up a relatively larger share of Mexico s economy than the United States   meaning Mexico would most likely have more economic damage from a border closing  Mr  Zandi said But that does not mean the United States would be in a winning position  Communities across the country would probably see supply chain disruptions  product shortages  seizures in stock and bond markets and a plunge in already fragile business confidence  Mr  Zandi said  The disruption would be especially sharp in the border states of California  Arizona  New Mexico and Texas  which all have Mexico as their No  1 export market Any closure could have far ranging implications for a wide range of industries   including automotive  electronics and apparel   that source small components and deliver their products on a just in time basis on both sides of the border It could also be devastating for the agriculture industry  Since the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994  American farmers have moved toward specializing in corn  soybeans  chicken  dairy  pork and beef to supply to Mexico  while Mexican farmers have specialized in fresh fruits and vegetables to send to the United States  Any delays in deliveries of these products could lead to near immediate price hikes and empty supermarket shelves  which would hit low income Mexicans and Americans the hardest Christin Fernandez  the vice president for communications at the Retail Industry Leaders Association  said that slowing or halting screenings at major ports near the border would lead to product delays and potentially higher shipping costs  The entire retail ecosystem is sustained on the expectation that America s retailers can provide consumers with the goods they want and need  when they need it  at the best possible prices   Ms  Fernandez said   If our suppliers are feeling the pain  retailers will feel the pain  and  ultimately  it is consumers that will bear the burden  Stock markets do not appear to be pricing in any risk of a border closure  The S P 500 was essentially unchanged on Tuesday  and it remains near a six month high  

WASHINGTON   He flew across the ocean to celebrate NATO s 70th anniversary with the largest and most important member of the military alliance  So to outsiders it appeared to be an awkward moment on Tuesday for Jens Stoltenberg  the NATO secretary general  as he sat stiffly by while President Trump criticized German defense spending and predicted that the United States would get along with Russia  I accept there are differences  but when it comes to defense spending we all agree   Mr  Stoltenberg said in an interview after his meeting with Mr  Trump  putting a positive spin on the situation He said the president had helped push member states to budget an additional  100 billion in defense spending and credited Mr  Trump with  having a real impact   I say that because it is a fact   Mr  Stoltenberg said   Allies are now really stepping up  But not all  Germany will most likely slow the growth of its defense spending   meaning that Europe s economic powerhouse will defy a spending target set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  And other member states are struggling to reach the current goal of spending 2 percent of their economic output on the military by the end of 2024 The scene on Tuesday was just the latest example of Mr  Stoltenberg s unenviable efforts to bridge seemingly irreconcilable positions between Europe and the United States He is the European leader who has shown the most deft hand with Mr  Trump  A trained statistician  Mr  Stoltenberg came to the White House with charts showing how defense spending has risen But his credit of Mr  Trump for the spending increases has annoyed European leaders  He is a little too diplomatic   said Jim Townsend  a former Pentagon official who oversaw relations with NATO and is now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security   Sometimes he has a hard time whacking an ally over the head  Mr  Stoltenberg has sought to balance Mr  Trump against German politicians  who have made clear they are sick of the president s demands  The challenge will only grow throughout this week as Mr  Stoltenberg appears before members of Congress to praise both their support of the military alliance and Mr  Trump s drive for a more equitable share of military burdens Germany this year is putting 1 35 percent of its gross domestic product toward defense spending  and in 2020 will spend 1 37 percent  New budget projections by Berlin show Germany will spend 1 25 percent of its economic output by 2023 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the defense minister  Ursula von der Leyen  have said they remain committed to the 2 percent goal   Germany will keep its promise   Ms  von der Leyen said Tuesday on German public radio Hours later  fueling the pressure  Mr  Trump said member states should spend potentially even more than 2 percent on defense In the Oval Office  Mr  Stoltenberg sat stone faced as Mr  Trump criticized Germany for  not paying their fair share   The president also predicted   I think we ll get along with Russia   ImageGerman armored vehicles and an American helicopter during NATO led exercises  Germany s defense spending levels fall below what President Trump is demanding from alliance members CreditIrakli Gedenidze ReutersSince 2014  NATO has deployed military forces to Eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression  It has also intensified efforts to rebuild European militaries that have eroded since the end of the Cold War But the alliance faces an array of challenges it has not previously confronted  and does not yet know how to tackle   including Russian interference in elections and domestic politics  and China s economic investments in telecommunications networks In the interview with The New York Times  Mr  Stoltenberg suggested the alliance s policy on Russia was consistent with Mr  Trump s desire for better relations  He pointed to the cooperation by his own home country  Norway  with Russia on fisheries and other matters  We now have a strong  common understanding of how to approach Russia   Mr  Stoltenberg said   Those allies who were skeptical of dialogue with Russia have seen that we have delivered on deterrence and defense  The gatherings to commemorate NATO s anniversary were originally planned as a week of events in Washington for heads of state and government  But Mr  Trump s angry speeches  public and private  at other alliance gatherings over the last two years persuaded allies to downgrade the anniversary celebration to a meeting of foreign ministers The goal  according to current and former American and European officials  was to limit Mr  Trump s participation Even Tuesday s meeting with Mr  Trump was not originally on Mr  Stoltenberg s agenda  But then Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had invited the NATO chief to address Congress  a speech that is scheduled for Wednesday European officials said Mr  Stoltenberg had not yet accepted the invitation when Ms  Pelosi announced it  That put him in the position of potentially leaving Washington without seeing the president but addressing the Democrat led House  which has approved a measure that seeks to block Mr  Trump from withdrawing from the military alliance Last week  NATO made the unusual move of extending Mr  Stoltenberg s term a second time  by two more years  meaning he would leave office in 2022  It is an acknowledgment of Mr  Stoltenberg s deft touch not just with Mr  Trump  but also with other difficult alliance leaders  including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary Mr  Trump endorsed the extension on Tuesday   I had no doubt in my mind who I wanted   he said European officials said their worries about Mr  Stoltenberg s cozy relationship with Mr  Trump were pushed aside  largely to avoid giving the president an outsize role in selecting a new NATO leader  Mr  Stoltenberg was scheduled to step down in 2020  at the height of an intense election in the United States In the interview with The Times  Mr  Stoltenberg said he had consulted with Ms  Merkel  and noted that the new budget unveiled by Germany was not final  Germany has submitted a spending plan to NATO that shows defense spending rising by 80 percent between 2014 and 2024  he said  adding that he expected Berlin to live up to that plan  The Germans have told me it will further increase   he said Friction is growing in Germany  The Social Democrats  Ms  Merkel s center left coalition partners who control the finance ministry and were in charge of the latest budget plan  are using the dislike of Mr  Trump in their election campaign ahead of European parliamentary elections in May Julianne Smith  a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin and a former Obama administration national security official  said the Social Democrats were using the military budget to show they were the party  that stands up to Donald Trump   This decision became a bit of a referendum on Donald Trump  instead of a referendum on Germany s hollowed out forces that desperately need these resources   she said

WASHINGTON   President Trump backed off plans to introduce a Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act after Senator Mitch McConnell privately warned him that the Senate would not revisit health care in a comprehensive way before the November 2020 elections Reversing himself in the face of Republican consternation  Mr  Trump said his party would not produce a health care plan of its own  as he had promised  until after the elections  meaning he will only try to fulfill his first term promise to repeal and replace his predecessor s signature program if he wins a second term The president s abrupt about face  announced on Twitter on Monday night after talking with Mr  McConnell  all but ensured that health care will take a central place in next year s campaign  elevating an issue Democrats consider one of their strengths  But it may take the legislative heat off Republicans exasperated by Mr  Trump s unexpected push to devise a wholesale replacement for President Barack Obama s health law in the coming months  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   Mr  McConnell  the majority leader from Kentucky  said on Tuesday   He did say  as he later tweeted  that he accepted that and that he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign  ImageListen to  The Daily   Trump Wanted to Scrap

from his call to replace the Affordable Care Act with a Republican alternative  Alex Burns on why the president s own party talked him out of it  It s Wednesday  April 3 alexander burnsSo last week was as close to a moment of total happiness as President Trump has had in a long time  music archived recording 1President Trump s legal team as well as many of those who are close to the president are saying they feel the Mueller report fully vindicates the president after nearly  archived recording 2There s no way to take this letter other than a huge win for the president archived recording 3To say White House officials are happily telling the American people I told you so  well  that would frankly be a bit of an understatement archived recording  donald trump And after three years of lies and smears and slander  the Russia hoax is finally dead  The collusion delusion is over alexander burnsThat s what makes it all the more surprising that his administration decided to dive right back into one of the most politically damaging fights of his whole presidency  which is health care archived recording 1The Trump Justice Department just announced a major reversal on Obamacare archived recording 2Today  he called the Affordable Care Act horrible and is mounting a push to kill it off archived recording 3Fresh off his Mueller investigation victory  some of his biggest supporters are questioning the timing archived recording 4Here you have a huge messaging win for the president and the White House with this Mueller summary  Why now  Why do this archived recording 5Why now  maybe even why at all michael barbaroAnd how does he dive back into that politically damaging fight alexander burnsHe directs the Justice Department to take sides in a lawsuit that has been making its way through the federal courts  It was brought by Republican legal officials in a number of states  It has been ruled on by one judge in Texas that the Affordable Care Act is invalid archived recordingA federal judge in Texas has just struck down Obamacare  True story  Judge Reed O Connor says the individual mandate  the part of the law that requires you to participate  is unconstitutional  And because it cannot be separated from the rest of the law  which it cannot be  the entire law is invalid alexander burnsIt is seen as a really long shot challenge to the Affordable Care Act  something that  in all likelihood  will probably not result in the law being struck down as a whole  but the White House was going to have to decide at some point whether they were going to defend the A C A  at the highest levels of the legal system or whether they were going to take sides against a law that s on the books that Congress failed to repeal when it had the chance  And that s what they did archived recording  donald trump We think it will be upheld  and we think it will do very well in the Supreme Court  And if the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out  we will have a plan that s far better than Obamacare michael barbaroAnd my sense is that under normal circumstances  the White House almost reflexively defends laws put on the books by Congress alexander burnsIt s a pretty extraordinary step for the president to take sides  not just against a law that s already on the books  but really the biggest piece of social legislation that s been passed in recent history  And he does it at the urging of some of his most conservative advisers in the White House  including the chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  archived recording  mick mulvaney And it s hard to know where to begin when you re talking about how bad the current health care legislation is for small business alexander burns  who  before he was a member of the Trump administration  was a hardliner in the House of Representatives waging war on the Affordable Care Act from Capitol Hill archived recording  mick mulvaney It s almost as if the folks who wrote this piece of legislation last year either have no idea how small business works or they don t care how small business works  Either way  the current health care legislation is a complete disaster for small business  and  alexander burnsThe argument that Mulvaney and others make is that if the president is going to run for re election as a guy who made promises and kept his promises  especially to conservative voters who still care a lot about getting rid of Obamacare  he has got to take every chance he has to go against it michael barbaroAnd given the dynamics of Congress  this is perhaps his best chance alexander burnsMaybe his only chance  because Democrats now control the House  There is really no shot for Republicans to pass a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act  So if they re going to take it down  they re going to take it down in the courts michael barbaroO K   well  what is the response to this announcement alexander burnsWell  Democrats are totally elated archived recording  nancy pelosi This is actually an opportunity for us to speak to the American people with clarity archived recording  chuck schumer It s a stark reminder of the difference between our two parties  Democrats are fighting to expand and improve health care coverage and lower costs while Republicans are trying to take it all away and raise costs alexander burnsThey have spent  at this point  several days on the defensive about some of the claims that they made about what was likely to be in Robert Mueller s report  They are desperate to get away from their own divisive fights about the nature of liberal health care policy  You have had  in the presidential primaries  in the House of Representatives  even in the Senate where Democrats aren t in control  just endless tugs of war between moderate liberals  very liberal Democrats  far left Democrats over what kind of health care system the country ought to have in an ideal world  Should it be European style single payer health care  Should it be a system that just totally does away with private health insurance  All these kinds of divisive debates on the left that have had Democrats tripping over each other  But President Trump weighs in the way he does on the Affordable Care Act  and all of a sudden all those conflicts hit pause archived recording  nancy pelosi Oh  no  please archived recording SINGING  Happy birthday to you alexander burnsAnd the timing on the Democratic side is sort of comical in that it is literally Nancy Pelosi s 79th birthday  archived recordingHappy birthday to you alexander burns  the morning after this Justice Department announcement comes out  And when you have Democrats singing  Happy Birthday  to her  there was this sense in the caucus that she had gotten the best gift a president could have given her michael barbaroWhat is the reaction from Republicans in Congress alexander burnsWell  real dismay and surprise and sort of horror archived recordingEven Republicans appear bewildered by President Trump s promise to make the G O P  the party of health care alexander burnsAnd not just from the few remaining relatively moderate Republicans archived recordingSome Republicans are nervous about that  including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy  According to Axios  McCarthy called the president and told him the decision made no sense  saying the health care battle helped Democrats win the House and several state capitals last year alexander burnsEvery Republican analysis of the midterm elections concluded that they lost the House because of health care more than any other individual policy issue  So if you are Kevin McCarthy  the new House minority leader  you are just appalled at the idea that your members are now going to have to have this fight all over again michael barbaroRight  We had talked about this with you during the midterms   that there had been this huge public shift on Obamacare and that voters who might have previously been against it now do not want it taken away alexander burnsThat s right  It was less of a thank you to Democrats than a punishment for Republicans  that Democrats never got the political boost back in 2010  2012  2014 that they hoped they would get for passing a big new social benefit  But what they did ultimately get was the benefit of voters turning against Republicans who wanted to take those benefits away  So Obamacare as a term  as a law  still kind of a mixed bag politically  but there are elements in that law  like protections for people with pre existing medical conditions  that are enormously popular  And Republicans look back on the last campaign  the one that ended really rather badly for them  and see that as  more than anything else  the fatal political mistake they made michael barbaroSo why would President Trump  the leader of the Republican Party  who had to have watched that same midterm that you re describing  why would he do this if the takeaway of that midterm is that the Affordable Care Act is no longer toxic and might even be liked by a wide cross section of Americans alexander burnsIn the president s public statements  and as far as we can tell based on his personal thinking  he recognizes that health care is a huge political vulnerability for Republicans  that the last thing they did on health care  that big repeal drive  was politically devastating to them  And his proclamation that they need to become the party of health care clearly reflects an understanding that a problem needs to be fixed archived recording  donald trump So we re going to get rid of Obamacare  And I said it the other day  The Republican Party will become the party of great health care  It s good  It s important michael barbaroI guess I can see President Trump s argument there  It feels kind of legitimate  Wouldn t it be smart for Republicans heading into the next presidential election  2020  to recognize that there are things that voters like about the Affordable Care Act  But in order for it to be a benefit for the Republicans and not the Democrats  they need to convince voters that the Democratic plan is a bad one and that Republicans will give them a better one alexander burnsRight  But giving voters a better version of health care provided by the Republican Party has always had to mean more than just getting rid of the system that currently exists  It s this strange kind of bifurcated mental space that Republicans have been living in politically  where they want to run against Democrats for trying to blow up the health care system and replace it with single payer  and  on the other side  they want to get rid of much of the existing health care system and replace it with something to be named later michael barbaroIn other words  they don t really have a plan to replace it alexander burnsThey don t  and they kind of never have  not a consensus plan that s supported by a broad cross section of the party and voters  And that s why when the president came out with this position through the Justice Department and then suggested that Republicans in Congress ought to come up with something great  the backlash from Republicans at the highest levels of the congressional party was swift and severe  The view among congressional Republicans was that this was just sort of a total fantasy coming from the president  The idea that they would not only come up with a plan and come up with a plan that would be popular and meet the standards that the president has laid out in rally after rally  but that they would do it within a year and then run on it in 2020 just seemed like it was cut from whole cloth michael barbaroIs there also a feeling among Republicans toward the president along the lines of  dude  we just want to stop calling attention to this issue  It s a losing issue for us  Stop drawing attention to it alexander burnsOh  absolutely  And if the concern among folks like Mick Mulvaney is that walking away from the fight looks like surrender  the view from a lot of Republicans on the Hill is they ve already lost  They can talk about how they lost  or they can talk about other stuff  and the president is choosing to talk about defeat michael barbaroRight  Instead of talking about what I had imagined Republicans would be talking about for the next couple of months and maybe even the next year  which is the Democratic fight over  Medicare for all   the Democratic fight over whether private insurance should even exist   I had expected that that would be the consuming discussion in the political world and in the political campaigns to come when it came to health care alexander burnsSo did I  and I think so did a lot of Republican candidates down the ballot preparing for 2020  There was always going to be tension in the Republican message about Democratic radicalism on health care  because if you are running in 2020 on the idea that Democrats are going to blow up the current system and replace it with European style medicine  you re kind of implicitly defending the status quo system as it exists under Obamacare  It s an extraordinarily awkward position for Republicans to be in  Can you be opposed to Democratic proposals to make the health care system even more liberal  even more regulated or structured by the government  without essentially defending the system that Barack Obama put in place  We don t know how they re going to walk that line  We don t know to what extent they ll even try  But the president s current approach  which is to say that Democrats will do something drastic and bad to your health care  and I m not quite going to tell you what I m going to do yet  doesn t seem sustainable michael barbaroSo what happens in the last 24 hours or so to this Trump led project to try to strike down  repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act alexander burnsWell  after days of other Republicans expressing public discomfort with where the president was headed  archived recording  mitch mcconnell So I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate alexander burns  Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader  conveyed in no uncertain terms to the White House that this was a non starter in the Senate  that the president was free to do what he wanted to do on health care  but that Senate Republicans were not going to be taking the lead on this  It was not a fight they wanted  period  full stop archived recording  mitch mcconnell So we don t have a misunderstanding about that  We will not be doing comprehensive in the Senate alexander burnsThe president seemed to have gotten the message archived recordingPresident Trump on the retreat archived recording  donald trump No  I wanted to delay it myself  I want to put it after the election alexander burnsAnd his response was to go onto Twitter and to declare that they are totally going to do all the things that he said they were going to do  but at a much later date  after the 2020 election michael barbaroRight  He cited the date 2021  We will do all this right after the election alexander burnsRight after an election when  in his construction  he would be re elected  Republicans would hold the Senate  and they would take back control of the House  So that s not just a delay of game  That is setting a whole bunch of other conditions on what would need to happen to get there michael barbaroWere you surprised  Alex  that the president backed down on this so quickly alexander burnsI was surprised by how fast it happened  I wasn t surprised that he sort of came up with a really big theory of what should happen next and then eventually let it disintegrate  because we ve seen that pattern a number of times  But to pick a fight this big and to stick with it for so little time is the definition of politically counterproductive michael barbaroSo now  we are basically back where we started  The Affordable Care Act is likely to remain the law of the land  So what did we learn from this weeklong ordeal alexander burnsWell  the biggest thing we learned is that the politics of health care have been turned on their head in the last couple of years  and that the Affordable Care Act is no longer a liability for Democrats  and that Republicans  whether they want to acknowledge it or not  have largely abandoned the fight  music  The fact that you had the senior most members of the congressional party saying so clearly to a president they helped elect and have loyally supported  we don t want to touch health care   it would have been sort of unimaginable to someone five years ago that that would happen with a Republican president in office michael barbaroAlex  thank you very much alexander burnsThank you  music alexander burnsTomorrow s my birthday  so this is like a little birthday special michael barbaroYay  Is that on the mic lisa tobinHappy birthday tomorrow michael barbaroWe ll be right back   MUSIC   Here s what else you need to know today archived recording  theresa may Despite the best efforts of M P s  the process that the House of Commons has tried to lead has not come up with an answer  So today  I m taking action to break the logjam michael barbaroIn her latest attempt to rally support for Brexit after a series of embarrassing setbacks  British prime minister Theresa May said she would seek a new delay for leaving the European Union and would begin negotiating a Brexit plan with her political rivals in the Labour Party archived recording  theresa may I m offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan that we would both stick to to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal michael barbaroThe attempt to work across the aisle with the Labour Party suggests that May cannot win enough support within her own Conservative Party to pass her Brexit plan archived recording  theresa may The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum that both the leader of the opposition and I could put to the House for approval  and which I could then take to next week s European Council michael barbaroUnless May secures another delay  Britain is currently scheduled to leave the E U  without a negotiated plan on April 12  That s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow The president s last attempt to replace Mr  Obama s health care program blew up in 2017 when his party controlled both houses of Congress  Democrats seized the House in last year s midterm elections in part on a promise to defend the most popular parts of the Affordable Care Act  so when Mr  Trump revived the issue last week  it distressed Republicans who consider it a political liability Mr  Trump had surprised allies by ordering his administration to ask a federal court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act and then promised a Republican replacement  Democrats  consumer groups  doctors  hospitals and insurance companies have said that 20 million people could lose health coverage if courts accept the administration s argument Mr  McConnell said he spoke with Mr  Trump on Monday afternoon to explain that the Senate would not return to the issue in a broad way before the next election   I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans  view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives   Mr  McConnell said But if that warning was meant to quiet the president  it did not work  Hours later  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter   The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums  cost    deductibles than ObamaCare   In other words it will be far less expensive   much more usable than ObamaCare   he said in a string of three tweets posted Monday night   Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House  Democrats jumped at the opening  Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said at a rally in front of the Supreme Court   Translation  they have no health care plan  It s the same old song they ve been singing  They re for repeal  They have no replace  Mr  Trump appeared to be gambling that he could turn the tables on an issue that has long favored Democrats by portraying them as increasingly extreme  Even as party liberals  including some presidential candidates  embrace the idea of  Medicare for all   Republicans have used it to accuse Democrats of favoring a socialist  government run health care system that would close down all private insurers  I see what the Democrats are doing  it s a disaster what they re planning and everyone knows it   Mr  Trump told reporters on Tuesday at the White House   You re going to lose 180 million people under their private insurance  Wary of such attacks  the Democratic congressional leadership has played down a single payer system run by the government and advanced incremental measures to shore up the health care law and lower prescription drug prices Many Republicans in Congress were happy to assail Medicare for all but not enthusiastic about ditching Mr  Obama s program without a ready replacement  No plan of their own could pass the House  but it would invariably require policy choices that Democrats could attack Image The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesEven some of the president s own advisers were confounded by his move  Soon after the president decided last week to intervene in a Texas court case on the side of invalidating the entire Affordable Care Act without a Plan B  Mr  Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with Ronna McDaniel  the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee  and Brad Parscale  Mr  Trump s campaign manager Both Mr  Parscale and Ms  McDaniel tried to tell the president that they could not understand what he was doing  according to a person familiar with the call Mr  Trump replied that if they did nothing  Democrats would continue to own the issue and the other option was being known as the party that could not figure out how to properly draft a health care legislative package  the person said In several private conversations since last week  Mr  McConnell told the president that he believed Democrats owned the dysfunction associated with the Affordable Care Act and that Mr  Trump was essentially letting them off the hook by inserting himself into the debate again  according to another person briefed on those discussions Mr  Trump denied on Tuesday that Mr  McConnell asked him to back off  saying   I wanted to delay it myself  because Republicans do not control the House   So if we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency   which I hope are two good assumptions   we re going to have a phenomenal health care   he said Seeking to capitalize on the issue  the House will vote this week on a resolution urging the Justice Department to reverse its position and defend the 2010 health care law in court  forcing lawmakers to take a side on the case  The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   said Speaker Nancy Pelosi The resolution  offered by a freshman Democrat  Representative Colin Allred of Texas  says that the Justice Department should  cease any and all efforts to destroy Americans  access to affordable health care  and reverse its position  in the court case  Texas v  United States Some of the president s senior advisers pushed him to join the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the entire current health care law  a more expansive position than the administration had taken previously  when it argued that protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down But others raised concerns  including the White House counsel  Pat Cipollone  Mr  Cipollone said that Attorney General William P  Barr had issues with joining the suit  too  But once the president made clear his mind was made up  the Justice Department went along without complaint  people familiar with the events said Among those objecting was Senator Susan Collins  a moderate Republican from Maine who sent a letter to Mr  Barr expressing her  profound disagreement  with the move  Rather than seeking to have the courts invalidate the A C A    she wrote  referring to the Affordable Care Act   the proper route for the administration to pursue would be to propose changes to the A C A  or to once again seek its repeal  The administration should not attempt to use the courts to bypass Congress  Mr  McConnell sought to calm Republican nerves  saying  there s no point in pushing the panic button  because the court system would take a long time to resolve the dispute  I don t think any of these policies are in any immediate danger   he said Mr  Trump has basically commissioned four Republican senators to devise a replacement for the Affordable Care Act  The group consists of two doctors  John Barrasso of Wyoming and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana  as well as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  a close ally of the president  and Senator Rick Scott of Florida  who was the chief executive of a large for profit hospital firm before he entered politics Mr  Scott said on Tuesday that he was focused on bringing down health costs  especially prescription drug prices   Obamacare has made health care way more expensive   he said   Co payments are up  Deductibles are up  Premiums have skyrocketed  When asked about developing a wholesale replacement for the Affordable Care Act  Mr  Scott responded   I m a business guy   adding   I didn t try to do grand bargains   

President Trump  despite his own history of buying a porn star s silence and bragging about sexual misconduct  on Thursday leveled another broadside at Joseph R  Biden Jr   tweeting a meme that mocked the former vice president for putting his hands on women s shoulders The 15 second meme  accompanied by the text  WELCOME BACK JOE    doctored a video that Mr  Biden released on Wednesday in which the former vice president explained his history of physical contact with women  some of whom say his behavior made them uncomfortable  Mr  Biden has said he tried to comfort people with hugs  kisses and other physical contact when they appeared nervous In the meme  as Mr  Biden delivers his explanation  a pair of hands appears on his shoulders  and then an image of Mr  Biden s head pops up and appears to sniff the back of the former vice president s head  The meme appeared to be a reference to an accusation by a former Nevada assemblywoman  who said in an essay published last Friday that Mr  Biden had touched her shoulders  smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head at a campaign event in 2014  Joe Biden s hugs and kisses were well known in Washington  Now he faces a generational reckoning  Mr  Biden is widely expected to join the 2020 presidential race soon  and some Democrats view him as perhaps the most formidable challenger to Mr  Trump  But in the last week  accusations from several women that Mr  Biden touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable have threatened to upend his fledgling campaign  and on Wednesday  he addressed the claims directly for the first time in a video posted to his Twitter feed Mr  Trump s supporters have seized on the accusations against Mr  Biden  viewing them as an early opening to attack a potential Democratic candidate they already view as perhaps his strongest adversary  On Tuesday  a pro Trump group  the Great America PAC  released a  Creepy Joe  Biden ad  Mr  Trump himself has also already weighed in on the allegations  Joking on Tuesday night about asking for a kiss  Mr  Trump said   I felt like Joe Biden  This is not the first time the president has used a doctored video to taunt an adversary  In July of 2017 he posted a clip on his Twitter account that showed him wrestling with and punching a figure whose head had been replaced by the logo of CNN  the cable news network that he has regularly attacked  

President Trump stopped short of announcing a final trade deal with China on Thursday  saying in an Oval Office meeting with the Chinese delegation that it may take another four weeks or more to secure an  epic  trade agreement Negotiators had originally aimed to secure a deal this week during a visit from Liu He  the Chinese vice premier and special trade envoy  and announce a presidential summit meeting between Mr  Trump and Xi Jinping of China  But after more than a year of tit for tat tariffs  on and off negotiations and threats of additional punishment  the United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues  including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed  and when  We re talking intellectual property protection and theft  We re talking about certain tariffs   Mr  Trump said  referring to issues that remain unresolved People familiar with the negotiations had said that the president was poised to announce a summit meeting with China  But those plans spurred a backlash among some of the president s trade advisers  who argued that announcing a meeting before the deal was struck would weaken the United States  hand and give it less leverage to force changes it is seeking In remarks at the White House  Mr  Trump said that the deal was  very complete  and that the two sides had  agreed to far more than we have left to agree to   I think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to   he continued But he said there would be no summit meeting until a final deal was made   If we have a deal then we ll have a summit   the president said The date and location of a summit meeting have also proved controversial  The United States had initially proposed holding one at Mar a Lago  Mr  Trump s Florida resort  but China has been pushing for an official state visit in Washington or a neutral location in a third country  people familiar with the matter said Lawmakers had publicly fretted about announcing a summit meeting before the deal was inked  suggesting that Mr  Trump was surrendering his leverage in his eagerness to sign an agreement Both Republicans and Democrats have urged Mr  Trump to hold out for a tough deal to combat Chinese practices that American businesses have long seen as problematic  including the coerced transfer of foreign technology as a condition of doing business in the country and the ample government subsidies for Chinese firms  Last week  POTUS told us he would not sign a  good  trade deal with  China he would only sign a  great  one   Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  said in a Twitter post on Thursday morning   I believe him  But to be a  great  deal it must allow us to do in China what they can do in US   it must have real enforcement mechanisms  The United States has pressed China to make commitments on purchasing American goods  opening markets to foreign business and increasing protections for foreign intellectual property in a bid to rebalance an economic relationship that Mr  Trump says is unfair for American workers  It remains to be seen how sweeping and significant any agreement will be  and whether it will achieve the lofty promises Mr  Trump has made about resetting the economic relationship with Beijing But the White House is also facing pressure to resolve the trade war  which has begun to hurt American farming  manufacturing and other sectors  and caused wild swings on Wall Street  Industries including automaking  technology manufacturing and farming have anxiously awaited reduced tariffs and details of a new agreement  which will have huge implications for their businesses The president s tariffs have been successful at bringing the Chinese to the negotiating table  and his advisers have insisted they will not squander an opportunity to press China for substantial economic reforms that past administrations were unable to secure  Still  the Chinese have balked at making any reforms that could be viewed as infringing on their sovereignty or undercutting the Communist Party s control of the economy  If you and I are making a deal  and you have to drag me kicking and screaming the whole way  what are the odds the deal is going to hold   asked Derek Scissors  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute   I don t find that the slightest bit convincing  American negotiators have pushed for an enforcement mechanism that would allow tariffs on Chinese goods to snap back if China violated the terms of the deal  and that would forbid China to retaliate  But Chinese negotiators have resisted such an idea  describing it as a potential infringement on their sovereignty Myron Brilliant  the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  said foreign stakeholders would be scrutinizing the deal to see whether it contained a strong enforcement mechanism that would hold the Chinese accountable to their obligations  That is what would separate this agreement from previous agreements   he said The two sides spent the past two months drawing up more than 120 pages of an agreement covering issues including forced technology transfer and cybertheft  intellectual property rights  currency and nontariff barriers to trade  The Trump administration has also pressed China to commit to hundreds of billions in purchases of American products  including agricultural products  energy and airplanes The administration has been eager to front load China s purchases of American products to help bolster farm country and other important constituencies and try to bring down the bilateral trade deficit before the 2020 election  Mr  Trump s advisers would prefer to keep the tariffs in place as long as possible  an arrangement the Chinese oppose In recent weeks  Beijing has introduced a steady drumbeat of other reforms intended to please American constituencies and win Mr  Trump s favor  China has resumed purchases of American soybeans and announced it would reclassify fentanyl  which has fueled the American opioid epidemic  as a controlled substance  Beijing also approved a sweeping rewrite of a foreign investment law that may help foreign companies avoid unequal treatment  And it approved a request by JPMorgan Chase to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country and floated the idea of expanding access for foreign cloud computing companies China experts have cautioned that the long running economic stresses between the countries are unlikely to be entirely put to rest with this round of negotiations  The negotiations  no matter what anybody says  will not end at the end of this phase   said David Lampton  a fellow at Stanford University s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies   We ve got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to nominate Herman Cain  who abandoned his 2012 presidential bid in the face of escalating accusations of sexual misconduct  for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board Mr  Trump  speaking from the Oval Office  called Mr  Cain  the former chief executive of Godfather s Pizza   a truly outstanding individual  and said   I ve told my folks that s the man  The decision to consider Mr  Cain is the second time in weeks that the president has floated candidates with deeply held political views and past ethical issues to fill a seat on the Fed  signaling his intent to put allies on a traditionally independent body  It comes as Mr  Trump has continued to attack the Fed and his handpicked chairman  Jerome H  Powell  for raising interest rates in 2018  saying those moves slowed economic growth Last month  Mr  Trump said he planned to nominate Stephen Moore  a conservative economist who advised his presidential campaign and has become a vocal critic of the central bank s recent rate increases  as a Fed governor Mr  Trump has staked his presidency on a booming economy and his re election could hinge on whether it continues to surge or falter  The Fed  which has the ability to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates and using other tools at its disposal  will play a crucial role in the economy s trajectory While presidents have long stocked regulatory agencies with partisan appointees in pursuit of ideological goals  the Fed s seven member board of governors has largely been an exception given the role it plays in the United States economy  The Fed s primary job is to guide the economy  typically by adjusting interest rates  It aims for sustainable growth  maximum employment and stable prices  It also regulates banks and oversees the plumbing of the financial system Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short term growth at the expense of inflation and instability  Some modern presidents have opined openly about what the Fed should do  including President George Bush  who declared in a State of the Union address that the central bank should keep rates low But in recent decades  the volume of public commentary greatly diminished as politicians concluded that pressuring the Fed was counterproductive The president has largely abandoned that tradition  Last year  as interest rates rose and the stock market declined  Mr  Trump repeatedly attacked Fed policy as  crazy    wild  and  loco   He asked aides whether he could replace the chairman and lamented privately that Mr  Powell s appointment was one of his biggest regrets The Fed  which raised rates for five consecutive quarters amid a roaring economy with the lowest unemployment rate in nearly two decades  has since paused its campaign  Mr  Powell has repeatedly rebuffed any suggestion that the central bank is being influenced by Mr  Trump s broadsides  saying it is adopting a more  patient  approach to interest rates given signs of economic weakness in the United States and abroad With two open seats on the seven member Fed  Mr  Trump has the ability to drastically shape the central bank for the foreseeable future  The president has already appointed four of the Fed s current governors  who carry 14 year terms  One governor  Lael Brainard  is a holdover from the Obama administration The appointment and confirmation of Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain could put the Fed in uncharted territory  While the institution has strongly rooted values around technical competence and apolitical debate  Mr  Trump s latest choices have been political actors rather than in the weeds experts in any of the main areas in which the Fed makes policy Two governors alone cannot entirely shape Fed policy  but they can have an effect on decisions  The Federal Open Market Committee  which sets interest rates  consists of 12 voting members  including the seven governors  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents  who serve one year terms on a rotating basis  Changes to interest rates must be approved by a majority of the voting members Both Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain are undergoing background checks  and if nominated  must be confirmed by the Senate The choice of such candidates to fill two of the most powerful jobs in economic policy is raising fears among some Fed veterans that the president is installing political allies at the central bank to do his bidding  It s one thing to put cronies into the executive branch  but I think the central bank is another kind of institution that it s so critical in that it holds the reins solely to monetary policy   said Sarah Bloom Raskin  who served on the Fed s board of governors from 2010 to 2014   It has the potential to undermine the credibility of monetary policy  Mr  Cain s nomination is being supported by Larry Kudlow  who heads the National Economic Council and also recommended Mr  Moore for a Fed seat  according to a person familiar with the discussions While he heaped praise on his  friend  Mr  Cain  Mr  Trump earlier in the day continued his assault on the  destructive actions  taken by the Fed and said on Twitter that the economy was very strong despite the central bank s efforts The selection of Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain appeared to be a counterweight to Mr  Powell  But while Mr  Moore has been publicly critical of the Fed and called for Mr  Powell to resign  Mr  Cain s views are less clear As a presidential candidate  Mr  Cain rode a brief surge in popularity to the top of the polls on the back of his  9 9 9  economic plan  The proposal called for scrapping the existing tax code and replacing it with a flat 9 percent income tax  a 9 percent business tax and a 9 percent national retail sales tax  The concept was hailed by some for its simplicity  but it ultimately fizzled with his campaign On monetary policy  his views are equally unorthodox  In a 2012 op ed in The Wall Street Journal  Mr  Cain accused the central bank of manipulating the value of the dollar by raising and lowering interest rates by whim and called for a return to the gold standard  which was abandoned in 1971  For the last 40 years in Washington  regulate has meant manipulate  with the Federal Reserve raising and lowering interest rates and buying and selling assets at its own discretion   Mr  Cain wrote  arguing that a complex society needs fixed standards   A dollar should be defined   as it was prior to 1971 under the postwar Bretton Woods system   as a fixed quantity of gold  Mr  Cain is also a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  a role that is often given to local business leaders  In a 2011 interview with The Atlantic  Drue Jennings  who served with Mr  Cain on the board  said that Mr  Cain was an  inflation hawk  when it came to monetary policy  a moniker attributed to those who view rising prices as a threat to economic growth and favor higher interest rates to keep inflation in check Mr  Trump has made clear he has no interest in a Fed governor who wants to raise rates but  more recently  Mr  Cain has shown that he has evolved on the subject  If I were offered the job  I would try to encourage the Fed not to make inflation a fear factor because deflation  as Stephen Moore had pointed out in a great article that he wrote along with another economist  deflation is more of a fear factor than inflation   Mr  Cain said in a February interview with the Fox Business Network Perhaps most important to Mr  Trump  Mr  Cain has shown that he is loyal to the president  In September  Mr  Cain formed the America Fighting Back PAC  which has a mission of publicly rebutting what he believes is misinformation about Mr  Trump  We re offering a compelling  solid refutation to what you hear from the media and the rest of the left about President Trump and conservative ideas   Mr  Cain said at the time It is unclear whether Mr  Cain will clear the background check  His presidential campaign came to a screeching halt after several women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment or improper behavior The selection of Mr  Cain drew backlash on Thursday from some of those women Ginger White  who publicly said in 2011 that she and Mr  Cain had had an affair  said that he should not be rewarded for such actions  Ms  White said that the affair was on and off for 13 years and that Mr  Cain denied it because he was seeking the Republican nomination for president  We need honesty and integrity in those who are appointed to public office   Ms  White said in a statement released by her lawyer  Gloria Allred   Herman Cain should not be rewarded for his bad behavior  In my opinion  he lacks what should be required for appointment to the Federal Reserve or any public office  Sharon Bialek  who is also represented by Ms  Allred  came forward in 2011 and accused Mr  Cain of grabbing her in a sexually aggressive way when she sought his help after losing her job at the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s  Ms  Bialek said in a statement on Thursday evening that Mr  Cain sexually harassed her and that he was not fit for public service  I did not think that he was a man of character then  and I do not think he is now   Ms  Bialek said   Anyone who uses their position of power to take advantage of a woman does not possess the character  integrity or values required to serve on the Federal Reserve Board  In some ways  Mr  Cain  who preferred news interviews to intensive retail campaigning  presaged Mr  Trump s own outsider campaign four years later  But unlike the president s presidential bid  Mr  Cain s was fatally wounded when he faced charges of sexual misconduct In October 2011  Politico reported that Mr  Cain  as head of the National Restaurant Association  had been accused of sexually harassing two women  who left the trade group after receiving financial payouts and signing nondisclosure agreements  One of the women  who was from Chicago  said that Mr  Cain made an unwanted and rough physical advance Confronted with the claims  Mr  Cain initially did not deny them  He later proclaimed his innocence and sought to cast blame on political rivals and the news media for what he called a smear campaign Other women emerged soon after to say that they  too  had been sexually harassed by Mr  Cain  By that December  he dropped out of the presidential race  

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Tuesday lashed out at Puerto Rico s local lawmakers as  grossly incompetent  and singled out one of his favorite targets  Carmen Yuln Cruz  the mayor of San Juan  as  crazed and incompetent  Mr  Trump s latest invective toward the local leaders of an island devastated by a hurricane in September 2017 came in a torrent of tweets  which began on Monday night and spilled into Tuesday morning  Mr  Trump was reacting after the Senate on Monday blocked billions of dollars in disaster aid for Midwestern states  in part because Democrats said a proposed  600 million in nutritional assistance to Puerto Rico fell short of its needs  Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter  He also stated  incorrectly  that Puerto Rico had received  91 billion in aid from the federal government In fact  FEMA and other agencies have so far distributed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion in aid has been allocated  while  91 billion is the budget office s estimate of how much the island could receive over the next two decades Gov  Ricardo A  Rossell of Puerto Rico  a Democrat  responded to Mr  Trump in a tweet of his own on Tuesday   Mr  President  once again  we are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Mr  Rossell wrote Mr  Trump has long been sensitive when it comes to the subject of Puerto Rico  where the federal government s response to Hurricane Maria was widely criticized as too slow  Aides and allies said Mr  Trump had vented privately that Puerto Ricans had complained too much  and he had also noted privately that Hurricane Maria  which killed 2 975 people as a result of the storm and its effects  was not as bad as Hurricane Katrina  in which fewer people   1 833   were killed Mr  Trump has long hit back at Ms  Cruz  who during the disaster became the most outspoken critic of the federal response On Tuesday  Mr  Trump seemed to imply in his tweets that Puerto Rico was not part of the United States  noting that local elected officials  only take from USA   Hogan Gidley  a White House spokesman  seemed to underscore the view in the White House that Puerto Ricans were not Americans when he twice referred to the island as  that country  during an appearance on MSNBC Mr  Trump s apparent disdain for the island s leadership has led to a breakdown of communication between local officials and the White House For weeks  Mr  Rossell has asked the White House for a private meeting with Mr  Trump to lay out the island s case for why it desperately needs federal funds for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria  But Mr  Rossell s request has gone unanswered  and he has tried instead to communicate with the president publicly  saying in cable news interviews  in official appearances and on Twitter that he fears Mr  Trump has been misled about Puerto Rico s needs Mr  Rossell s fight may be an uphill battle with a president who has made it clear that he views more federal aid to Puerto Rico as throwing money away  Mr  Trump s advisers also view the pleas from local officials as part of a campaign to shift the blame for what they view as severe mismanagement of the supplies and money sent after the storm People familiar with Mr  Trump s thinking said he was skeptical that additional aid would not be used to pay down Puerto Rico s debt  The acting White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  who has made it clear that he believes Puerto Rico will need to find its own way out of the debt crisis  is believed to be encouraging the president s negative view of the island In Puerto Rico  however  Mr  Trump s stance is being viewed through the lens of race  In an interview on Tuesday  Mr  Rossell mentioned  unprompted  that Puerto Rico s population was almost entirely Latino and said that historically  there have been  ethnic undertones  to the treatment of Puerto Ricans by Washington   We don t want special treatment   he said   We just want equal treatment  The governor also has bigger issues to deal with at home  The resignations of two power players in his cabinet became public late on Monday  Julia Keleher  the education secretary  and Hctor M  Pesquera  the public safety secretary  had been among the least popular members of Mr  Rossell s government  Their departures dominated the headlines in the local news media  which made little reference to what is widely seen here as yet another episode of presidential bluster That is not to say Puerto Ricans necessarily disagree with Mr  Trump s criticism of the commonwealth s leaders  even if many locals dislike the president himself  or the disdainful way he sometimes refers to the island  We have a political caste that is opportunistic and extremely corrupt   said Eduardo Lalo  a well known local novelist  humanities professor and opinion columnist who supports Puerto Rican independence   What the president says  of course it s clumsy and tremendously vulgar  and he says it for reasons of his own that are not substantive  But it s also objective  Image We are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Gov  Ricardo A  Rossell of Puerto Rico said in a tweet to President Trump CreditThais Llorca EPA  via ShutterstockThe truth is  he said   Puerto Rico is a colony of the United States  and therefore its hands are completely tied  At a bakery in the comfortable San Juan neighborhood of Ocean Park on Tuesday  the morning crowd was hardly abuzz about Mr  Trump s comments  though people had noticed them One patron  Miguel Rodrguez  54  pulled out his cellphone to show how  moments earlier  a friend had posted on Facebook that she agreed with the president for the first time in praising Puerto Ricans but labeling their leaders  corrupt  Mr  Rodrguez  the owner of a company that installs security systems  scrolled down to the comment he left under his friend s post   We do not lack resources  we have too many thieves   The government wants to keep demanding money from the government of the United States   Mr  Rodrguez said   But much of that help doesn t reach the people  Politically  Mr  Rossell is in an unenviable position experienced by all of his predecessors  Puerto Rico cannot get funding even for its food stamp program without approval from Congress  but it has no congressional representation to make its case in Washington   Representative Jenniffer Gonzlez Coln  a Republican  has no vote in the House   None of the previous governors  however  had to deal with the dire consequences of a devastating hurricane in the middle of a government bankruptcy  Neither Trump nor any president of the United States nor any official in the United States has assumed the responsibility it has with Puerto Rico   Professor Lalo said   The great tragedy of the Puerto Rican people is that for 120 years  it calls Washington and no one picks up the phone  Mr  Rossell  who is up for re election next year  has faced intense criticism on the island for trying to work cooperatively with Mr  Trump even as the president was repeatedly deriding Puerto Rican leaders Last week  the governor amped up his language against Mr  Trump  appearing to refer to him as a  bully  in an interview with CNN  If the bully gets close  I ll punch the bully in the mouth   he said   It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage  He later characterized his comments as a metaphor Mr  Trump has refrained from going after Mr  Rossell by name  preferring to focus his attention Ms  Cruz  his political nemesis since her outspoken comments criticizing the Trump administration s failure to provide swift and meaningful help in the weeks after Hurricane Maria After Mr  Trump called Ms  Cruz  crazed and incompetent  on Twitter on Monday  she fired back  calling him  unhinged   He can huff   puff all he wants but he cannot escape the death of 3 000 on his watch   she wrote   SHAME ON YOU  Ms  Cruz recently declared her candidacy for governor  She and several other candidates are hoping to unseat Mr  Rossell in 2020  He is a supporter of Puerto Rican statehood  she is not  When he doesn t get his way  he tries to pit people against each other   Ms  Cruz said of Mr  Trump in an interview on Tuesday   Three thousand people died under his watch and he has never acknowledged it  He s now trying to weaponize help   and  in his desperation  he s lying about it  Calling Puerto Rican leaders  corrupt  reflects poorly on Mr  Trump s own administration  she added  If he thinks that the money that has come to Puerto Rico is money that we shouldn t have received  then he doesn t trust FEMA   she said   He shows his inability to lead and that he is incapable of understanding how his own government works   

WASHINGTON   During his presidential campaign  Donald J  Trump often complained about how President Barack Obama drew red lines that he never enforced  and how a diminished America let Russia walk into Syria unchallenged  something he said would not happen if the Russian leader respected the United States president Now  in Venezuela  President Trump is facing his own red line moment   again  with Vladimir V  Putin of Russia For the past week  the Trump administration has  escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country  claiming that Moscow is helping to prop up President Nicols Maduro of Venezuela and undermining the hopes of American officials that the Venezuelan military will oust him  The United States has been trying to rally the world behind Juan Guaid  the opposition leader  as Venezuela s legal interim president On Monday morning  speaking at the Army War College in Carlisle  Pa   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said flatly   Russia s got to leave Venezuela  That followed a statement on Friday by John R  Bolton  Mr  Trump s national security adviser  who said that the arrival of roughly 100 Russian military  advisers  in the country  along with new arms  posed  a direct threat to international peace and security in the region   Mr  Bolton also warned that no country should enter the Western Hemisphere  with the intent of establishing or expanding military operations  Such declarations seem to set up a test  Would Venezuela be the place where Mr  Trump  who has often seemed willing to tolerate Mr  Putin s most audacious provocations  finally draws his own red line  And  if so  does he have a plan to enforce it It is notable that Mr  Bolton  not Mr  Trump himself  made the Friday announcement  with its echoes of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine  the first time the United States issued similar warnings telling foreign powers not to intervene in the Western Hemisphere  In offering the unvarnished declaration on Monday   and while Mr  Trump focuses on the southern border   Mr  Pompeo said he was merely repeating the president s sentiments on Venezuela Yet Mr  Maduro is digging in   despite the economic sanctions against his government and the recognition of Mr  Guaid as interim president by the United States and more than 50 other nations  And Mr  Putin may well see an opportunity to replay Syria in Venezuela  propping up another leader that many American officials said had to go   Mr  Maduro instead of President Bashar al Assad of Syria  this time   and frustrating Washington s regional goals The administration so far has been quite cautious when it comes to threatening military action in Venezuela  While there have been ritual reminders that  all options are on the table   there is no indication that any military intervention   which has a long and unhappy history in Latin America   is being seriously contemplated Instead  the administration is beginning to talk about an extended battle of attrition  After the Maduro government declared last week that Mr  Guaid could not hold public office for 15 years  Elliott Abrams  the State Department s special representative for Venezuela and a veteran of many Cold War battles in Latin America  told reporters   I don t imagine that Juan Guaid is deeply worried because the Maduro regime  while it might be around in 15 days  is not going to be around in 15 years   Why is Russia helping Venezuela  He then talked about tightening sanctions on oil sales  dismissed Russian accusations that the United States was trying to mount a coup against Mr  Maduro and warned that it  would be a mistake for the Russians to think they have a free hand here   they don t   But he carefully avoided explaining why Mr  Putin might feel under constraint ImageA Russian military plane recently arrived in Venezuela  The Trump administration has escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country CreditYuri Cortez Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Putin has plenty of reasons for keeping Mr  Maduro in power  Russia is also focused on recovering billions of dollars in debt that Mr  Maduro owes it  some of which is being paid back in oil  Full repayment may never happen For Mr  Trump  this is the newest iteration of his many Russia problems   and the latest example of his reticence to talk publicly about Moscow s malign influence around the world  His silence is jarring  since Mr  Bolton  Mr  Pompeo and Gen  Joseph F  Dunford Jr   the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  talk about it almost every week They have all embraced the administration s year old national security strategy  which recognizes that a resumption of great power competition  not terrorism  is the primary challenge facing the United States today  Mr  Trump s former aides say  however  that he never read the full national security strategy  and they note that when he does talk about it  he almost never discusses Russia s behavior Perhaps that is a reaction to the enormous  bipartisan criticism he received after his seemingly deferential approach to Mr  Putin in Helsinki  Finland  last summer  when Mr  Trump once again appeared to be convinced by the Russian leader s denials that he had interfered with the 2016 United States presidential election Or perhaps it is rooted  as one of Mr  Trump s aides suggested recently  in a desire not to create the kind of public sound bites that Mr  Obama did   and that he came to regret It was Mr  Obama who declared in August 2011 that  for the sake of the Syrian people  the time has come for President Assad to step aside   And it was Mr  Obama who warned that  the use of chemical weapons is a game changer   then elected  once the chemical weapons were employed  to pull back from military action  Just a year ago  Mr  Trump was still citing that decision  declaring in a tweet that  if President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line in The Sand  the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago  The president is not alone in his critique of how the Obama administration handled Syria  One of the most thoughtful analyses of what went wrong came from William J  Burns  Mr  Obama s deputy secretary of state  in his new book on American diplomacy   The Back Channel   It is rife with warnings that could also apply to Venezuela Mr  Burns agreed with what he called Mr  Obama s  long game  calculus   which included  having the discipline to avoid getting sucked into another military entanglement in the Middle East  which would likely only underscore the limits of our influence in a world of predators for whom Syria s battles were existential  But he admitted that the Obama  short game  was lacking because  we misaligned ends and means  promising too much  on the one hand   declaring  Assad must go  and setting  red lines    and applying tactical tools too grudgingly and incrementally  on the other  Reached in London over the weekend  Mr  Burns praised the Trump administration for avoiding military entanglements that are bound to raise cries of American imperialism  even among Mr  Maduro s greatest opponents  But he said it was at risk of repeating some of the Obama administration s mistakes  The focus on building political and economic pressure is sensible   he said  And he noted that the geographic distance between Russia and Venezuela limited Mr  Putin s ability to affect events   Proximity matters   he said   They don t have a way to project their power in ways they demonstrably did in Syria  As a result  much hinges on Mr  Trump s ability to build a hemispheric coalition  a move that is being undermined  Mr  Burns argued  by the tension with Mexico  especially with Mr  Trump s recent threats to close the border and to end assistance to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras Mr  Maduro  too  may be learning some lessons from Mr  Assad  he said   As long as you control the guys with the guns  even the most unpopular and deeply repressive regimes have the capacity to hang on a lot longer than we might assume   

FAIRFAX  Va    A Virginia judge on Monday temporarily sealed divorce records for Stephen Moore  President Trump s presumptive nominee for the Federal Reserve board  adding to the tax and child support drama surrounding the pending nomination A Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County issued a temporary injunction sealing the 2011 divorce records at the request of Mr  Moore s former wife  Allison Moore  The court order does not list Mr  Moore as opposing the request  The judge scheduled a Friday hearing on the merits of keeping the documents under seal Those records  posted online Monday by The Guardian  which first reported details of the divorce  show that a judge found Mr  Moore in contempt of court in March 2013 for failing to pay more than  330 000 in spousal support  child support  attorney s fees and a one time fee to his ex wife  Mr  Moore had failed to pay six consecutive months of child support   and only a small fraction of the nearly  19 000 a month he had agreed to pay his ex wife in the divorce settlement   at the time of the ruling According to the records  Mr  Moore failed to respond to repeated requests from the Virginia court to make payments and did not show up for a deposition in the case  The court ordered him to sell his home to raise money to pay the debt and forced him to set up an automatic bank transfer each month  After Mr  Moore paid  217 000 toward the debt  Ms  Moore asked the court to revoke the order for Mr  Moore to sell his home  which it did The divorce case is the latest twist in the nomination saga of Mr  Moore  who is in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over  75 000 in back taxes  which are related to his child and spousal support payments Mr  Trump said last month that he would nominate Mr  Moore  a campaign adviser who  like Mr  Trump  was a loud critic of the Fed s interest rate increases last year  At the time of the announcement  Mr  Moore had not been formally vetted by the White House  The administration has not yet submitted his nomination to the Senate In her 2010 divorce complaint  Ms  Moore accused Mr  Moore of  emotional and psychological abuse  during their 20 year marriage  and accused him of carrying on an adulterous relationship that he was  neither discreet nor inconspicuous  about  The complaint said Mr  Moore had left receipts for dinners with his mistress around the house and that he purchased a T shirt for his lover with the words  Doing It  In his response  Mr  Moore said he did not contest anything in Ms  Moore s petition Neither Mr  Moore nor Ms  Moore responded to repeated requests for comment over the weekend or on Monday Mr  Moore is a longtime champion of tax cuts  deregulation and other conservative economic policies  He is a former editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal and the founder of the Club for Growth  which advocates lower taxes  He has held shifting positions on monetary policy over the years  including endorsing a return to the gold standard and  when President Barack Obama was in office  criticizing the Fed for leaving interest rates low in an effort to stoke economic growth Since Mr  Trump took office  Mr  Moore has pushed for lower rates  In December  angered by the fourth rate increase of the year  he called for the Fed s chairman  Jerome H  Powell  to step down or be fired Mr  Trump has lauded Mr  Moore s views on the Fed  but it is unclear whether he could win Senate confirmation Last year  the I R S  filed a lien against Mr  Moore related to the  75 000 in back taxes  Mr  Moore  in an interview last week with The New York Times  described that lien as a  huge miscalculation  by the agency It is unclear whether the  75 000 tax lien relates to the child  and spousal support payment delinquencies laid out by The Guardian Mr  Moore said in an interview on Thursday that  for a single tax year  he had claimed both the value of his alimony  which at the time was deductible for all divorces  and the value of his child support payments  which are not  He said the child support amounted to about  18 000  which  given his tax bracket  worked out to about  6 000 in taxes that he owed but did not pay  He blamed the error on his accountant But Mr  Moore said he was not simply hit with a back tax bill  After an audit  he said  the I R S  deemed his return for that year  fraudulent  and disallowed other deductions  With penalties and fees  the amount came to more than  75 000  he said Mr  Moore said he and his current wife had tried for years to resolve the issue with the I R S   including dispute resolution  but had not heard from the agency in nearly two years A prominent critic of Mr  Moore s nomination  the University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers  said he was deeply troubled that Mr  Moore had been held in contempt of court given that he could soon hold a seat on the Fed  For a Fed governor  your credibility is an important asset   Mr  Wolfers said   Putting someone in a position of trust who has been in contempt of court could easily create difficult situations  particularly in an institution like the Fed  which at least during the crisis had to invent new responses on the fly while making sure they were legal  White House officials were adopting a wait and see approach on Monday before deciding whether to go through with the nomination  according to two people familiar with the discussions  who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal White House conversations Mr  Trump  these people said  remains personally fond of Mr  Moore and values his loyalty  but has been surprised by the criticism of Mr  Moore and the negative reaction among some Senate Republicans  who were angered by Mr  Moore s previous comment that the president should fire Mr  Powell for raising interest rates  Mr  Moore has since apologized for that statement Questions have also arisen over Mr  Moore s tenure at The Wall Street Journal  including whether he wrote editorials that referred to groups that paid him to give speeches In May 2013  for example  Mr  Moore spoke at the Civitas Institute  a nonprofit conservative research group in North Carolina  He was paid more than  3 000 for an honorarium and expenses  said Brian Balfour  executive vice president for Civitas  The next month  Mr  Moore wrote an editorial about tax cuts in the state and approvingly quoted Civitas s former president  In July  in another editorial criticizing liberal protesters at the state s capital  Mr  Moore cited a Civitas analysis of financial statements from groups supporting the protests According to a Journal spokesman  editorial board members are  allowed to accept compensation for speeches from nonprofit organizations if they are approved in advance and do not overlap with the member s coverage area  Mr  Moore s predicament did not come up during a round of discussions on Monday at the White House between Mr  Trump and his economic team  according to a person familiar with the discussion  who also requested anonymity  The discussions  this person said  were focused on rebooting a repeal of Obamacare and included a presentation by Kevin Hassett  chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers  warning against the possible damage to the economy of closing the border with Mexico Appearing on CNBC on Monday morning  Mr  Hassett was not asked about the records  but called Mr  Moore  a great guy  Mr  Hassett suggested that Mr  Moore would likely avoid the public spotlight in coming days  When you re getting ready for Senate confirmation  you have to focus 100 percent on that   he said   I expect that s what we ll see from Steve going forward   

Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter WASHINGTON   It s no secret that President Trump really  really dislikes wind power  He s been vocal on the subject for years  ever since a battle with Scottish officials over a plan to build what he called a  really ugly wind farm  within sight of his golf resort in Aberdeen More recently  in rallies and speeches  Mr  Trump has stepped up his attacks on wind turbines  suggesting that their noise can cause cancer  there s absolutely no evidence of this  and predicting power failures when the wind stops blowing  also not true   Here s a closer look at a few of his recent comments You might get cancer   You won t  During a sometimes rambling digression about wind turbines at the National Republican Congressional Committee s annual spring dinner in Washington on Tuesday  Mr  Trump said   They say the noise causes cancer  The suggestion that turbine noises cause cancer is completely unfounded   The American Cancer Society is unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer   a spokeswoman for the group said in an email Separately  some researchers have been investigating claims that noise from wind turbines might cause other health problems like nausea  headaches or sleeplessness  So far  experts haven t found strong evidence of links to those conditions  although that debate is likely to persist  When compared to the research around coal power  an energy source that Mr  Trump has long championed  the difference is stark  There is ample evidence linking the particulate pollution from coal plants to heart disease  respiratory problems  and lung cancer  When Mr  Trump moved to relax restrictions on coal plant pollution last year  his own Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the change could lead to as many as 1 400 additional premature deaths each year by 2030 How Does Your State Make Electricity There s been a major shift in how America makes electricity over the past two decades  Each state has its own story Property values will plummet   Unlikely  At the same dinner  Mr  Trump made this claim   If you have a windmill anywhere near your house  congratulations  your house just went down 75 percent in value   There have been a few smaller studies suggesting that wind farm development may have depressed property values in some areas  But the balance of evidence suggests that this is uncommon  Much larger studies  including an analysis of more than 50 000 home sales across nine states conducted by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2013  have found no evidence that home values are generally affected by nearby wind projects  In any case  Mr  Trump s golf course in Scotland does not appear to have suffered financially after the construction of the wind farm nearby The lights will go out if the wind drops   They won t  At a rally in Ohio last month  Mr  Trump suggested that wind power was too unreliable to be useful   Let s put up some windmills   he said   When the wind doesn t blow  just turn off the television darling  please  There s no wind  Please turn off the television quickly  It s true that wind turbines generate electricity only when the wind is blowing  But that doesn t mean the power in your home will suddenly go out when the wind dies down Across the United States  regional grid operators typically rely on a diverse array of power sources throughout the day so that the lights stay on  During sunny hours  they can draw electricity from solar panels  When it s windy  they can make use of power from wind farms  If power from those renewable sources starts to drop  operators can use power from natural gas turbines or hydroelectric dams to fill in the gaps So far  America s grid operators have been very good at this balancing act  even as coal has declined and renewables have surged in popularity  Last year  wind power accounted for nearly one fifth of the electricity generated in the Texas grid  and people were still able to watch TV there  When power failures around the country do occur  it s almost always because of severe weather knocking out transmission lines  not because wind turbines stopped spinning However  it s also fair to say that if wind and solar power continue to expand   the two sources produced 8 2 percent of the nation s electricity last year and are growing rapidly   grid operators could face new challenges in juggling those intermittent sources Possible solutions for that might include adding batteries or other energy storage to balance supply and demand  or improving weather forecasts so that operators can better predict the output of wind farms  Or building more transmission lines to get access to wind power from distant regions  on the principle that the wind is usually blowing somewhere in the country Experts have concluded that it s technically possible for the United States to manage a lot more wind and solar power than it uses today  For instance  a 2016 modeling study published in Nature Climate Change found that  using existing technology  the country could get 55 percent of its electricity from wind and solar if it built a network of high voltage transmission lines  That study analyzed reams of historical weather data and concluded that the lights would stay on even with daily and seasonal fluctuations in the wind  To be sure  there are plenty of legitimate debates about what the power grid of the future should look like and how big a role renewable energy ought to play in that mix  But the fact that the wind can come and go is hardly a slam dunk argument against using wind power For more news on climate and the environment  follow  NYTClimate on Twitter They

WASHINGTON   The House on Thursday gave final passage to a bipartisan resolution forcing an end to United States military involvement in Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen  sending President Trump a pointed rebuke over his continued defense of the kingdom after the killing of a dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi The 247 to 176 vote  with 16 Republicans joining all House Democrats  invoked the rarely used War Powers Act to curb the president s executive power to wage war without congressional approval  It most likely sets up the second veto of Mr  Trump s presidency  this time to publicly defend a four year conflict that the United Nations has deemed the world s worst humanitarian crisis  with thousands of civilians killed and millions suffering from  famine The Senate passed the resolution in March  54 to 46  The vote in the Senate and in the House makes it clear that the United States will not continue to follow the despotic  anti democratic leadership coming out of Saudi Arabia   said Senator Bernie Sanders  independent of Vermont and one of the lead sponsors of the resolution   The United States should not be led into a war by a despotic  undemocratic  murderous regime  Supporters of the Yemen resolution have faced a grueling road in recent months to get the legislation onto the president s desk  The Senate   led by the resolution s authors  Senators Mike Lee  Republican of Utah  Christopher S  Murphy  Democrat of Connecticut  and Mr  Sanders   first passed the measure 56 to 41 in December  but Paul D  Ryan  the House speaker at the time  refused to take it up His successor  Speaker Nancy Pelosi  did  and the House easily passed it in February  But House Democrats inadvertently derailed the process by supporting a surprise procedural motion offered by Republicans to declare the chamber s opposition to anti Semitism  By attaching an unrelated amendment to the Yemen resolution  the House ended its  privileged  status  which would have forced the Senate to quickly take it up and send it to Mr  Trump The Senate then had to start from scratch The vote on Thursday amounted to a do over  Republicans again tried to derail the resolution with a last minute procedural maneuver to attach an amendment to condemn the movement to boycott  divest from and sanction Israel  a provision that put Democrats in a difficult position But this time  intent on ensuring the legislation would not be knocked off course again  Democratic leaders rallied their rank and file to oppose Republicans  efforts  Representative Ted Deutch  a Florida Democrat and one of the strongest pro Israel voices in the House  stood to condemn the Republican maneuver  This is about politics   he said   This is about trying to drive a wedge into this caucus where it does not belong  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the No  2 Democrat  accused Republicans of  using Israel as a partisan cudgel  and urged his colleagues to oppose the measure  Its intention is not to unite but to divide  Its intention is not to support our ally but to kill this bill through a cynical and dishonest tactic   Mr  Hoyer said as Democrats stood and applauded   Let s stop playing games with this very important and serious issue  To persuade the president to support the legislation  a bipartisan group of lawmakers   including Representatives Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and one of the lead sponsors of the resolution  and Matt Gaetz  Republican of Florida and one of the president s staunchest allies   requested to meet with the president  appealing to his desire  to achieve our shared interest in responsibly drawing down needless conflicts throughout the world  The House resolution employs the 1973 War Powers Act  which gave Congress the ability to compel the removal of military forces absent a formal declaration of war  Those powers  created in the wake of the Vietnam War  have almost never been used  as lawmakers have demurred from intervening in politically sensitive matters of war  peace and support for the troops  When we started talking with folks about doing this  they basically laughed it off   said Stephen Miles  the director of Win Without War  an advocacy coalition that lobbied for the resolution   They said it wouldn t happen  Congress doesn t ever invoke the War Powers Act  It was a really long arduous process of education  In its justification for opposing the resolution  the White House argued that the use of the act  is flawed  because the Pentagon has provided  limited support to member countries of the Saudi led coalition  in Yemen  That argument may have been more resonant years ago   repeated bipartisan attempts in 2016 to rebuke the American role in the Saudi led intervention stalled in both the House and the Senate  beginning with efforts to block the sale of munitions to the Saudis But after the killing of Mr  Khashoggi  a Virginia based columnist for The Washington Post  lawmakers on both sides of the aisle  livid at the administration s equivocal response  signaled a new willingness to reconsider the relationship with Riyadh  Lawmakers have grown increasingly vocal about reasserting their oversight on foreign policy  We are clawing back our constitutional responsibilities   said Representative Jim McGovern  Democrat of Massachusetts And the public has become more aware of the crisis in Yemen  where an estimated 80 percent of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance or protection and millions are without access to clean drinking water  according to the United Nations

In the post Watergate era  most Americans have taken for granted that a president would not fire an F B I  director investigating him  or replace an attorney general for insufficient loyalty to the president s personal interests  Dangling a pardon before potential witnesses to influence their testimony  Unheard of Whatever one s feelings about the end of the Mueller investigation  the Barr letter makes one thing clear  The guardrails that were established after Watergate against these types of abuses have been smashed  We still need to see the full Mueller report  but unless corrective steps are taken  Mr  Trump and Mr  Barr will have changed  perhaps profoundly  the shape of presidential power  and in troubling ways It s therefore up to Congress and the 2020 presidential candidates to step in and harden the policies that for 40 years prevented improper political interference in law enforcement They can do this by enacting comprehensive legislation to codify rules and practices that were previously voluntary  Those who subscribe to the Barr memo view of expansive executive power might claim that such legislation would violate the Constitution  On the contrary  such legislation would help enforce it First  Congress should restrict when and how the White House intervenes in law enforcement actions  giving teeth to the norms of the post Watergate era  One model for such legislation is a reform born out of President Richard Nixon s abuse of the I R S  to target enemies  Congress made it unlawful for certain officials  including the president  to  request  directly or indirectly   any I R S  officer or employee to  in effect  weaponize a taxpayer audit  Congress could apply that approach by prohibiting a president from intervening in individual law enforcement proceedings   or at a minimum require notification when a president or members of the White House staff do so  Such a rule would have imposed an additional bar  for example  on the president trying to get the Department of Justice to block the AT T Time Warner merger in retaliation for CNN s coverage  or from trying to investigate or prosecute political opponents Second  Congress should ensure that if the president issues or even dangles pardons in an attempt to block an investigation into his own interests  legislators will receive documents regarding the underlying investigation  once it s concluded   This will both ensure accountability and deter bad faith behavior  Representative Adam Schiff s Pardon Abuse Prevention Act provides a good start  it could be supplemented to apply to so called dangled pardons and to force disclosure of discussions with pardon seekers in investigations implicating the president Third  Congress can make it harder for the government to mislead the public  A little known law called the Information Quality Act creates a requirement that federal agencies ensure the quality  objectivity  utility and integrity of information they provide to the American people  Strengthening the act so that it applies to the president would help expose disinformation and make it more difficult for presidents to take executive actions based on false  determinations  and  findings   Finally  Congress should prohibit the president from using federal law enforcement powers to interfere in an electoral campaign  Procedures designed to check some such activity exist in the United States Attorneys Manual  but that merely compiles prudential guidelines  Congress should harden these rules and expand them to cover other law enforcement agencies  such as the Department of Homeland Security   It could require a Civil Service process to approve sensitive actions around campaign season  An even stronger measure could require early stage confidential judicial approval before a law enforcement action that might impact the outcome of an election could be taken  Such reforms would make it harder for a president to abuse power   such as by timing investigations or announcements to affect a political campaign  using the security clearance process to silence critics  sending immigration authorities to polling places or intervening in Secret Service activities to protect candidates and events Campaign season shouldn t bring government to a halt  and law enforcement shouldn t ignore actual wrongdoing in an electoral context  But given the abuses we ve seen in the past two years and others that might easily take place in the future  we ignore additional protections at our peril Some of these ideas already have bipartisan support  Clear statements by Congress implementing constitutional principles would also provide standards by which courts and the American people could judge the president s conduct The Constitution commands that the president  take care that the laws be faithfully executed   At its core  this commands the president to act in good faith  The founders thought this directive was so important they put it in the Constitution not once but twice  in the  take care  clause and the president s oath As the founders understood  the only reason We the People would delegate sovereignty to elected officials is if we were assured they would exercise that power in the public interest  If our legal system were to approve of the president exercising that power instead to protect his own interests  as the Barr letter does  we may find that our democratic experiment won t extend much longer Ian Bassin   ianbassin  and Justin Florence   justingflorence  are co founders of the nonpartisan nonprofit Protect Democracy  They both previously served as associate White House counsels The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what

WASHINGTON   At the heart of President Trump s negotiations with China is a troubling contradiction  The United States wants to use the trade talks to encourage the country to adopt a more market oriented economy  But a key element of a prospective deal may end up reinforcing the economic power of the Chinese state Negotiators are still working out deal terms  but any agreement seems certain to involve China s promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods  For Mr  Trump  this is an essential element that will help reduce the United States  record trade deficit with China and bolster farmers and other constituencies hurt by his trade war But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state  and most will be carried out by state controlled Chinese businesses  further cementing Beijing s role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese  It seems like those types of really simplistic purchasing commitment type of arrangements would actually reinforce state ownership rather than discourage it   said Rufus Yerxa  the head of the National Foreign Trade Council  which represents the United States  largest exporters After months of talks  the two sides are inching closer to an agreement  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  and Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  discussed the remaining sticking points with their Chinese counterparts on Thursday evening and Friday in Beijing  Mr  Mnuchin wrote on Twitter on Friday that the talks had been  constructive  Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by this week  to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He  the Chinese special envoy charged with negotiating the deal  who will begin meeting with his American counterparts on Wednesday The United States and China had been looking to reach a tentative agreement by the end of Mr  Liu s visit  with a signing ceremony between Mr  Trump and President Xi Jinping of China potentially later this month But the two sides are still wrestling with two major sticking points  how an agreement will be monitored and enforced and how many of Mr  Trump s tariffs come off and when  said Myron Brilliant  executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce Mr  Brilliant said there was no question the United States and China were  in the endgame with regard to a deal   However  he said these factors were  complicating the fact that the agreement is 90 percent done at this point  To pave the way toward an agreement  China made several announcements that could benefit American companies  Last week  Chinese regulators approved JPMorgan Chase s request to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country  a change China had discussed since entering the World Trade Organization two decades ago  Chinese officials have also floated the idea of an expanded trial that would allow foreign cloud computing companies to operate more freely On Sunday evening  China s Finance Ministry issued two statements saying that Beijing would continue to suspend tariffs it imposed last year on American cars and car parts in retaliation for Mr  Trump s tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese imports  Those tariffs  which were suspended while the two sides tried to reach an agreement  were supposed to resume at the end of March  but China said it would extend the suspension indefinitely as a gesture of good will ImageChina imported more than  100 billion worth of American goods last year  including large volumes of soybeans CreditChristopher Smith for The New York TimesThe Finance Ministry said   We hope that the U S  and China will work together to step up consultations and make practical efforts toward the goal of ending trade friction  While the two sides are closer to an agreement than at any point in the past  it remains unclear how successful the Trump administration will be in achieving its key goals  The president s trade war was initiated in large part to try to reorient the Chinese economy and force it to become more open to American companies and investment  Using punishing tariffs as leverage  the Trump administration has pressed China to roll back its heavy hand in the economy  including asking Beijing to curtail subsidies to state owned firms and to end its practice of forcing foreign companies doing business in China to transfer their technology to Chinese competitors China has not readily committed to these goals  in part because such commitments are seen as infringing on China s sovereignty and undercutting the power of the Chinese state  What the Chinese have agreed to most readily is purchasing American goods  especially commodities that can fuel their economy While the final list could be different  the United States and China have discussed the purchase of products including corn  soybeans  sorghum  natural gas  oil  coal  chemicals  semiconductors and airplanes  according to people with knowledge of the talks The Trump administration views these purchases as necessary to bolster the president s support across farming and manufacturing communities hard hit by the trade war and to help narrow the gap between what China sells to the United States and what it buys  The administration has been working on various draft lists of what it wants China to purchase  according to people who have viewed them The final purchasing amount is not yet clear  In December  Mr  Mnuchin said that China had made an offer to buy more than  1 2 trillion in American goods as part of the talks  But economists and China analysts have cautioned that such a large amount could be hard for the United States to produce and export The United States exported just  120 billion of goods to China last year  With the American economy hovering near full employment  it lacks the productive capacity to raise exports by hundreds of billions of dollars in the short term  The United States could redirect some of the goods it sells to other countries to China instead  for instance diverting soybeans headed to Europe to China But a deal that would require China to buy even more from the United States is raising concerns that China could expand its leverage over the United States  If it can be negotiated by government fiat  it can be taken away by government fiat   said Kevin Book  managing director at ClearView Energy Partners  an energy focused research firm The deal could usher in a wave of new American exports if China agrees to open its markets more fully  Removing its requirements that American carmakers and financial services firms team up with a Chinese entity to do business in the country  for instance  could give those firms more ability to sell goods and services to China But in other industries  including agriculture  energy and aviation  purchases associated with a trade deal would be made directly by state controlled entities  And while that would mean greater revenues for American companies  skeptics say it could also increase the leverage that China has over the United States in the future  We are handing them the ability to coerce our companies   said Derek Scissors  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute ImageWhile China would like to buy more tech goods  one of the Trump administration s biggest fears about China is that it is leading a state sponsored effort to unseat the United States as the leading technological power CreditKin Cheung Associated PressSuch a purchasing arrangement could also provoke challenges at the World Trade Organization  which bars its members from granting special advantages or privileges to any one country  as well as directing state enterprises to purchase goods from a specific country China has already demonstrated its ability to influence commodity purchases depending on the tenor of relations  analysts said  Once trade tensions flared  China drove its purchases of American oil to nearly zero last year  Mr  Book said  After a breakthrough in talks this year  China ramped up its purchases of United States soybeans  How easy would it be for the government of China to then turn off that tap when it gets into a dispute with the U S    Mr  Yerxa asked Recent events have also raised a question over some components of the purchasing package under discussion  China had planned to buy Boeing 737 Max series planes  But the crash of a 737 Max in Ethiopia in early March  the second deadly crash of the new plane in less than five months  has thrown those plans into question Last week  China suspended the airworthiness certification for the model entirely  a move Richard Aboulafia  vice president for analysis at the Teal Group  described as  pretty aggressive   I think there s a very good chance that this is less about public safety and more about trade negotiation leverage   Mr  Aboulafia said It s also unclear how many purchases of semiconductors  the advanced components that power circuits in laptops  smartphones and other electronics  will ultimately be in the deal While China would like to buy more of the advanced technology  the Trump administration is concerned about allowing Beijing to gain an upper hand in the next generation of technology  The administration has pushed China to roll back its Made in China 2025 campaign  an industrial plan that pumps state money into building cutting edge industries  like advanced manufacturing and aviation China had proposed last year to purchase  200 billion of American semiconductors  according to people with knowledge of the deal  Beijing wanted to buy the semiconductors straight from fabrication lines at American factories and then do the necessary packaging and testing in China  The United States rejected that idea  The two sides have since discussed a smaller number  but it is not clear now how many semiconductor purchases will ultimately be included in a deal The semiconductor industry has publicly warned that additional purchases could result in the Chinese government s gaining more power to control where Chinese companies buy products  While Chinese companies may buy more American components in the short term  the industry warns that Beijing could ultimately use such a system to redirect purchases to Chinese suppliers instead For now  administration officials are still trying to assure lawmakers that their trade deal will achieve the economic changes the United States wants and will require much more than purchases When pressed by lawmakers in February about whether the deal would require more than just additional sales to China  Mr  Lighthizer told Congress   I do not think it should just be a purchase agreement

WASHINGTON   Democrats controlling the House are proposing to cut back President Donald Trump s budget hikes for the Pentagon while significantly increasing spending on the domestic programs they favor Tuesday s move ramps up a battle with Trump and puts the Democratic House on a collision course with the GOP held Senate as the two chambers consider separate paths forward on the 12 annual spending bills  Work on the legislation is sure to consume lawmakers for months Trump s budget promised a 5  defense budget increase to  750 billion next year  while cutting day to day operating budgets for domestic agencies by  62 billion  or 10  Trump s proposal is a nonstarter with Democrats and Republicans alike  but there s been no progress on forging a bipartisan agreement that would be required to stave off the return of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration The Democratic proposal is by Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth of Kentucky and powerful Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York The plan would boost funding for nondefense agencies to  639 billion  up from  605 billion now  with  7 5 billion on top of that to cover costs for the U S  Census Defense would get a boost from  716 billion now to  733 billion under the Democratic plan  cutting Trump s planned Pentagon increase of  34 billion in half Yarmuth failed in his efforts to develop a more traditional   but nonbinding   congressional budget plan that would put lawmakers on the record on tax increases  Medicare and agency spending  Divisions among Democrats proved too difficult to overcome  and even the stripped down plan released Tuesday exposed rifts between party liberals and more pragmatic lawmakers The bill is scheduled for a committee vote Wednesday  but liberal Democrat Ro Khanna of California announced Tuesday evening on Twitter that he would oppose the measure  saying it would fund  endless wars  while not adding enough to domestic programs At issue is the roughly one third of the federal budget called discretionary spending that Congress passes each year  which is comprised of Cabinet agency budgets  Larger  mandatory  programs like Medicare and Social Security mostly run on autopilot Yarmuth said the plan is  a responsible framework for the country that ensures we make the needed investments for American families  our economy and our security  Without a deal signed into law by Trump  crunching budget limits   called spending  caps  in Washington speak   would kick in  whacking the defense budget down to  576 billion and nondefense agencies down to  543 billion  Lawmakers set the painful limits back in 2011 as a deficit cutting backstop in case a budget  supercommittee  failed to come up with an alternative The supercommittee collapsed in failure and lawmakers have been dealing with the hangover ever since  passing three different two year deals to set more realistic caps  The most recent catchall spending bill  passed in February to end a 35 day partial government shutdown  marked the end of the most recent agreement Republicans immediately blasted Tuesday s measure  which  unlike prior spending agreements  doesn t included offsetting spending cuts elsewhere in the budget to limit its impact on the deficit  House Democrats are not focused on doing a budget  nor are they focused on addressing our nation s mountainous debt   said Rep  Steve Womack of Arkansas  the top Republican on the Budget Committee   This bill doesn t include offsets or bipartisan input   key components of past caps deals  Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  D Calif   and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   would like to forge another bipartisan agreement to establish higher  more realistic spending levels  We have had some conversation about what we would do about the caps and where we go from here   Pelosi said Tuesday at a Washington event hosted by Politico But no real progress has been made  lawmakers and aides say  in great part because the White House is hostile to the idea Once Democrats translate their proposal into spending legislation  it s sure to attract a string of veto threats from the White House Instead  speculation has mounted that any measure to ease the automatic cuts may be tacked on this summer to must pass legislation to maintain the government s ability to issue bonds to cover its expenses  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump eased up Tuesday on his threats to shut the southern border this week as officials across his administration explored half measures that might satisfy the president s urge for action  like stopping only foot traffic at certain crossings Facing a surge of Central American migrants trying to enter the U S   Trump last week threatened to seal the border this week if Mexico did not immediately halt all illegal immigration into the U S   a move that would have enormous economic consequences on both sides of the border While Trump on Tuesday did not back off the idea completely  he said he was pleased with steps Mexico had taken in recent days and renewed his calls for Congress to make changes he contends would solve the problem  Let s see if they keep it done   he said of Mexico   Now  if they don t  or if we don t make a deal with Congress  the border s going to be closed  100    He also said that he might only close  large sections of the border  and  not all of it   He added that his posturing was  the only way we re getting a response  Later Tuesday  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen held an emergency call with Cabinet members and White House aides  saying   We are going to treat it as if we have been hit by a Category 5 hurricane   according to a person on the call  The person was not authorized to discuss the call publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Nielsen was creating an emergency operations center and named U S  Border Patrol official Manny Padilla as an operational crisis coordinator to manage the response from within the different immigration agencies at the Department of Homeland Security  Padilla is a 30 year Border Patrol veteran and was recently the head of the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas His job will be different from that of the immigration or  border czar  that Trump is considering  the official said Closing the border completely would disrupt manufacturing supply lines and the flow of goods ranging from avocados to cars  making for a  potentially catastrophic economic impact   in the words of Republican Sen  Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader Some inside the administration also worry it would only exacerbate illegal immigration Meantime  administration officials grappled with how they might minimize the impact of a shutdown or implement less sweeping actions White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow  for example  told CNBC he s been looking at potentially keeping truck lanes open  We are looking at different options  particularly if you can keep those freight lanes  the truck lanes  open   he said  As for the hundreds of thousands of tourists and workers who cross the border legally  Kudlow said   that may be difficult  Earlier  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had told reporters that  while   Eventually  it may be that it s the best decision that we close the border   the president was  not working on a specific timeline  and all options remained on the table  The Council of Economic Advisers  she said  was conducting a number of studies on the impact  and  working with the president to give him those options  White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in an appearance on MSNBC that closing only certain entry ports  or parts of all of them  could be among the steps short of closing the entire border It was a shift from Trump s threat late last week to seal the whole border  and quickly   I am not kidding around   he said then  exasperated by the swelling numbers of migrants  thousands of whom were being released into the U S  because border officials had no space for them  Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100 000 arrests or denials of entry in March  a 12 year high  More than half of those are families with children  who require extra care With southern border facilities near a breaking point  U S  officials are busing many migrants hundreds of miles inland and dropping them off at bus stations and churches  Trump has mocked and vowed to end that  catch and release  practice but overwhelmed authorities saw no choice Responding to Trump s threats  Nielsen rushed home late Monday night from Europe  where she was attending G7 security meetings and intended to fly to the border mid week to assess the impact of changes already made  including reassigning some 2 000 border officers assigned to check vehicles to deal with migrant crowds and new efforts to return more asylum seekers to Mexico as they wait out their case Officials were hoping to have as many as 300 asylum seekers returned to Mexico per day by the end of the week near Calexico and El Paso in Texas and San Ysidro in California  Right now  only 60 a day are returned Nielsen has also requested volunteers from non immigration agencies within her department and sent a letter to Congress seeking more money and detention space and broader authority to deport families faster  The request was met with disdain by Democrats Even absent the extraordinary step of sealing a national border  delays at border stations have been mounting due to the personnel reassignments  Homeland Security officials said  When the Otay Mesa  California  entry port closed for the night Monday  150 trucks were still waiting to get into the U S Shutting certain border stations or parts of them would not be unprecedented  Over the Thanksgiving holiday last year  Trump claimed he d already  closed the border  after officials briefly closed the northbound lanes at San Ysidro  California  for several hours in the early morning to bolster security because of concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members Mexican officials announced Monday they d pulled 338 Central American migrants  181 adults and 157 children  off five passenger buses in a southern state that borders Guatemala  and said they had detained 15 possible smugglers on immigration law violations  But that was not unusual for Mexico  which has for years been cracking down on migration In 2014 then President Enrique Pena Nieto launched a program that was described as ensuring orderly migration but in practice resulted in making it much more difficult for Central Americans to transit    Associated Press writers Catherine Lucey and Darlene Superville in Washington and Maria Verza in Mexico City contributed to this report     

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered a crackdown on counterfeit products on third party online marketplaces  asking for more information on how the United States can better track and curb such sales  The memo signed by Trump said that the value of global trade in counterfeit and pirated goods may rise to half a trillion dollars a year  with about 20 percent of this trade infringing upon U S  intellectual property  The president has decided it is time to clean up this Wild West of counterfeiting and trafficking   White House economic adviser Peter Navarro said on a conference call with reporters Companies including Amazon com Inc  eBay Inc and China s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd have policies that ban counterfeit goods and have pointed to their investments in programs to keep fakes off their platforms The memo did not identify specific companies by name   Amazon invests heavily in proactive measures to prevent counterfeit goods from ever reaching our stores  In 2018 alone  we spent over  400M fighting counterfeits  fraud  and other forms of abuse   an Amazon spokesperson said on Wednesday Alibaba said in a statement that it welcomes the initiative  and the attention it brings to the global fight against counterfeiting   Alibaba has developed best in class systems to protect IP and battle the scourge of counterfeiting   the company said   We look forward to further advancing the working relationship and cooperation that we have with the U S  federal agencies mentioned in today s order  as well as with our global commerce peers  The move comes as Trump and his economic advisers are locked in trade talks with China that the president says aim to reduce the theft of U S  intellectual property The order requires the Homeland Security Department  together with the departments of Commerce and Justice  to provide recommendations in 210 days on how to address the problem through better monitoring and enforcement  Navarro said   Reporting By Steve Holland  Editing by Meredith Mazzilli  

WASHINGTON    Not any longer  And with that  a triumphant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to close the book Tuesday on a divisive Republican debate  convincing President Donald Trump to shelve plans to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters It was a rare public disclosure of private counsel from the Republican leader  And it signaled that  after two years in Trump s Washington  Republicans on Capitol Hill are figuring out how to handle the president and his impulsive swerves on policy Trump insisted Tuesday it was his idea to switch course  I wanted to delay it myself   Trump said during an event at the White House   I want to put it after the election  Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week  backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   he said Speaking later Tuesday at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump said   Republicans should not run away from health care      If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose  Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  The president stunned Republicans last week by announcing he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  insisting the GOP could become the  party of health care   Republicans wanted no part of a do over after their failure to replace the law in 2017  Facing a revolt from the ranks  McConnell told the president he needed him to listen  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Several times McConnell told Trump to listen  the person said  And it worked  Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much  So we don t have a misunderstanding about that   McConnell said Tuesday Trump s shift   he tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections  when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House    made clear that the health care debate will be left for voters to decide during the race for the White House That arrangement suits Democrats just fine  They are denouncing Trump s attempt to overturn the ACA in court and floating various health care plans  including an expansion of government funded Medicare with so called  Medicare for All   setting up a stark contrast between the parties for the campaign trail Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will  hold Americans hostage through 2020  on an issue that affects millions of people  He said that Trump  insists he has a magic plan that we can see if only the American people re elect him  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats  health care battle with Trump is  a values fight  After Trump dropped the issue on Republicans last week  many hoped it would just go away  They had no comprehensive proposal to replace the ACA law and no big plans to unveil one  Publicly and privately  Republicans tried to talk to Trump McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking Rep  Mark Meadows  R N C   a Trump confidant  called shifting the debate to 2021  a very pragmatic decision   He said Tuesday that  spending quality time to develop a comprehensive strategy  would be  critical  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s 2010 health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017 when Republicans controlled both chambers in Congress  He still blames the late Sen  John McCain for joining other senators to oppose a last ditch plan While Republicans gained Senate seats last fall  GOP senators   particularly those up for re election next year   weren t looking for another fight over the law  They saw how the issue played in 2018  when Democrats made it the cornerstone of their successful drive to win back the House Preserving health care protections  and especially for people with pre existing conditions  resonates with voters  According to AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide  nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care at the top of a list of key issues As Democrats have blamed Republicans for trying to end the ACA  GOP backed challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts Last week  the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down  an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured In his late Monday tweets  Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that  will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America  Republicans appeared relieved that  for now  that battle will be fought during the campaign  rather than in Congress The No  2 Senate Republican  John Thune of South Dakota  said the president  has some big ideas and  to his credit  wants to solve problems   But Thune said   you run into that wall of reality   of a divided Congress with Democrats in control of the House  which requires bipartisanship  Trying to convey what the

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump took a shot on Tuesday at former Vice President Joe Biden  a possible Democratic rival in the 2020 race for the White House  mocking him over allegations of unwanted physical contact with women In a speech to a fundraising dinner for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump twice alluded to the allegations from two women that are hanging over Biden as he weighs whether to enter the contest to become the Democratic candidate in November 2020 presidential elections A former Nevada state legislator last week accused Biden of kissing her on the back of the head at a 2014 event  and a Connecticut woman said Biden rubbed noses with her at a 2009 event  Biden has said he did not believe he ever acted inappropriately  and his defenders have said he is known for hugging and being physically affectionate In wide ranging remarks that meandered for more than 80 minutes but often circled back to the 2020 race  Biden was the only potential rival Trump mentioned by name   a sign that he would view Biden as a strong challenger  were he to enter and win the Democratic race Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama and had a long career in the Senate before that  He had been expected to announce his bid for the Democratic primary race this month and has led the large field of Democratic hopefuls in opinion polls Trump told the dinner  which raised  23 million for Republicans running for the House of Representatives  a story about wanting to kiss a general he met in Iraq who had promised an expedient end to a campaign against Islamic State militants in Syria  I said   General  come here and give me a kiss   I felt like Joe Biden   Trump said  drawing laughter and applause Earlier  he told the crowd   which was dotted with members of the House   that they would be  going into the war with some socialists  in the next election  It looks like the only non   sort of  heavy socialist is being taken care of pretty well by the socialists   Trump said One of Biden s accusers has been a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders  who has already entered the Democratic primary race  and whose views are to the left of Biden  I was going to call him   I don t know him well   I was going to say   Welcome to the world  Joe  You having a good time  Joe  You having a good time   Trump said Trump struggled during his 2016 run for office with multiple accusations of unwanted sexual contact from women  particularly after videotaped remarks emerged of Trump bragging about groping women Biden  while campaigning for Trump s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton  had said he would like to take Trump  behind the gym  to beat him up for the comments   Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland  Editing by Michael Perry  

WASHINGTON   His border shutdown went from imminent to uncertain  A major health care push was declared and then delayed  Funding cuts were inserted in his proposed budget and just as quickly taken out President Donald Trump has been exploring the art of the climb down Trump pivoted on two big policy fronts this week  easing up on his threats to quickly close the southern border and deciding that a fresh effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act should wait until after the 2020 election The moves came as Republicans  outside groups and aides expressed anxiety about the potential economic and political fallout from Trump s proposals The president s swift backpedaling underscored his off the cuff style and suggested that more such drama is likely ahead as he tries to sync his policymaking with his re election campaign To many  the Washington whiplash was another reminder that Trump tweets first and governs later  Most presidents and even most CEOs  when they make a decision that is going to have financial impact or personnel impact  you seek a lot of input   said Republican strategist Rick Tyler   He doesn t do that  Even his own communications staff says he goes by his gut  The president s pronouncements and social media blasts are often surprise attacks  They can vanish as quickly as they emerge if political expedience warrants a different tack His announcement last week that the GOP was going to take on health care again despite a bruising and unsuccessful effort in 2017 stunned most in his own party and seemed driven in part by a lingering desire to fulfill his oft repeated 2016 campaign promise to repeal  Obamacare  He surprised his own education secretary with the declaration that he was reversing a plan to ax federal aid for the Special Olympics after the proposed cuts sparked a public outcry Few working for him ever want to get out in front of a Trump announcement for fear it will change at the last minute Trump s latest policy twists come after the conclusion of the special counsel s Russia investigation and as the president is turning his attention to his 2020 campaign His loose style also reflects his current leadership team  Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is viewed as a less controlling figure than previous chiefs  seeking to provide Trump with analysis and information  but not trying to restrict his conversations or steer his decisions After threatening last week to seal the border if Mexico did not immediately halt all illegal immigration into the U S   Trump on Tuesday appeared to be laying the groundwork for a delay  saying he was happy with steps taken by Mexico and that he would like to see Congress pass legislation revising the immigration system  Still  he held open the possibility of a border shutdown  saying   I m totally ready to do it  Trump has been threatening the closure privately for months  but his staff has been trying to slow him down with data about the economic impact and suggestions on ways to lessen the financial hit The president acknowledged the economy was on his mind Tuesday but played down those concerns  saying   Let me just give you a little secret  Security is more important to me than trade  On health care  Trump plunged into the fight again last week  prompted by a court deadline  But his motivations were always as political as they were legislative  with the president not wanting to cede a 2020 campaign issue to Democrats  And allies stressed Tuesday that the president had never laid out a timeline for legislation With his tweet Monday night  Trump made clear there would be no vote until after the 2020 election  though he insisted a GOP plan still was in the works His downgrade came after pressure from congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who said he told Trump  we were not going to be doing that in the Senate  Asked if he was acting at McConnell s behest  Trump insisted   I wanted to delay it myself  Heading into 2020  Trump sees border security and health care as key issues for his political base and he is expected to keep pushing them even if he dials back specific threats Speaking Tuesday night at the National Republican Congressional Committee s spring dinner  he declared that Republicans  should not run away from health care   If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose   Trump said    Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Kevin Freking contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   Stephen Moore  President Trump s presumptive nominee for a seat on the Federal Reserve board  said on Tuesday that he had no plans to withdraw from contention for the job despite ethical and financial problems that have surfaced in recent days  It s full speed ahead   Mr  Moore said in a brief interview before an event he was attending at the Trump International Hotel in Washington His potential nomination to the Fed has been clouded by revelations of a current tax lien and child support issues stemming from a previous marriage  Court records show that Mr  Moore  a conservative economist and a longtime adviser to Mr  Trump  was held in contempt of court in March 2013 for failing to pay more than  330 000 for spousal support  child support  attorney s fees and a one time fee to his ex wife  Allison Moore Mr  Moore also owes  75 000 in federal taxes  interest and penalties  according to court documents filed last year  which said a tax lien had been placed last year on his home in Montgomery County  Md Mr  Moore said that the White House was  100 percent  behind him and that he did not expect any other red flags to derail his expected nomination  He declined to address the specifics of the tax lien or the contempt of court citation  It s all been resolved   Mr  Moore said After his divorce became final in 2011  Mr  Moore failed to pay six consecutive months of child support   and only a small fraction of the nearly  19 000 a month that he had agreed to pay his ex wife  according to court documents Mr  Moore failed to respond to repeated requests from the Virginia court to make payments and did not show up for a deposition in the case  In 2013  the court ordered him to sell his home to raise money to pay the debt and forced him to set up an automatic bank transfer each month  After Mr  Moore paid  217 000 toward the debt  Ms  Moore asked the court to revoke the order to sell his home  which it did Mr  Moore previously told The New York Times that his dispute with the Internal Revenue Service was a result of a misunderstanding  He said he had claimed both the value of alimony to his former wife  which is deductible on federal tax forms  and the value of his child support payments  which are not eligible for a tax break  He also referred questions about the tax lien to his wife  Anne Carey Moore  who also said Mr  Moore had inadvertently deducted both alimony and child support payments On Monday  a Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County  Va   issued a temporary injunction sealing the 2011 divorce records at the request of Mr  Moore s former wife  The judge scheduled a Friday hearing on the merits of keeping the documents under seal  and Mr  Moore said he planned to ask the court to seal them permanently A moment before the interview  Mr  Moore was overheard telling an acquaintance that the attention on his personal life had been difficult  It s been a stressful time   he said But the personal drama does not seem to have affected Mr  Trump s plan to nominate Mr  Moore  who recently impressed him with calls for the Fed to cut interest rates  When the president told reporters that he would nominate Mr  Moore  a former editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal and the founder of the Club for Growth  the White House had not performed the kind of vetting that is typical for nominees On Tuesday  Larry Kudlow  director of the National Economic Council  said both he and Mr  Trump continued to support Mr  Moore for the Fed s board of governors  I think he ll make a great governor   Mr  Kudlow said   We are standing fully behind his candidacy  Asked if Mr  Trump was concerned about any of the recent allegations against Mr  Moore  Mr  Kudlow replied   No  not at all  He declined to specify when Mr  Moore would be formally nominated   He s being vetted right now  He s going through the regular process  He ll do fine  Mr  Kudlow  who was a best man at Mr  Moore s wedding  appeared to make light of the situation on Tuesday evening during a screening of a new film at the Trump Hotel After Mr  Moore gave opening remarks and saluted his wife  Anne  Mr  Kudlow expressed confidence in the nomination and offered a comedic caveat  All those good things will come true as long as you let Anne Moore deal with the I R S  The audience erupted in cheers and laughter  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump said Monday he wants to follow up on criminal justice reform with efforts that help federal inmates find jobs after they leave prison Congress passed legislation last year called the First Step Act that gives judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders and boosts prisoner rehabilitation efforts  The effort drew strong support from Republicans and Democrats worried that mandatory minimum laws had generated unfair sentences in many drug related cases Trump said Americans with criminal backgrounds are unemployed at rates up to five times the national average  which stood at 3 8 percent in February He said a  Second Step Act  will focus on  successful re entry and reduced unemployment for Americans with past criminal records   His goal is to cut that unemployment rate for ex prisoners to single digits within five years The president was short on details about what future legislation would include  but the White House said Trump s budget for the next fiscal year proposes more than  500 million to help prisoners succeed after their release  When we say  hire American   we mean all Americans  including former inmates who have paid their debt to society   Trump said Trump was joined on stage by a handful of former prisoners who have been helped through the First Step Act  He asked each of them to speak  sparking a unique level of spontaneity  sadness and cheer in the White House East Room as they recounted their experience  Gregory Allen noted that two months ago he was in a prison cell  and now he was telling his story at the White House  calling it an example of what would  make America great again   Allen said  borrowing from the president s trademark phrase as the audience laughed and applauded  

WASHINGTON   The House voted Wednesday to condemn the Trump administration for pushing a federal appeals court to obliterate the Affordable Care Act  and it urged the Justice Department to defend the law in court The vote  240 186  was nonbinding  but it documented the House s support of the health law  which was passed nine years ago without the votes of any Republicans  With the resolution  Democrats sought to put Republicans on the record for failing to come to the defense of the health law s most popular provisions  such as protecting people with pre existing medical conditions and mandating coverage for  essential health benefits   like mental health coverage  prescription drugs  emergency services and maternity care Eight Republicans voted for it  One Democrat opposed  The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land  and it is the responsibility of the Justice Department and the administration to defend the law of the land in court   Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said   What are they doing  Just the opposite  Why  Because they don t believe in governance  That is why they are happy to shut down government  The resolution  which expresses the sentiment of the House but is not subject to approval by the Senate or by President Trump  states   The actions taken by the Trump administration seeking the invalidation of the A C A  s protections for people with pre existing conditions  and later the invalidation of the entire A C A   are an unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people  Republicans called it an empty gesture  This will do nothing for your health care   said the House Republican leader  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California   But what will it do  It will make a great press release  Representative Greg Walden  Republican of Oregon  said the resolution was a political screed and  doesn t do a darn thing to protect people with pre existing conditions   Democrats would rather play politics with health care and attack the president for political purposes  rather than work with us on what could and should be bipartisan solutions   Mr  Walden said Democrats relished the opportunity to test Republicans  commitment to health care  an issue sure to figure in 2020 elections  I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeatedly claim that they stand for protections for people with pre existing conditions and for other protections included in the Affordable Care Act   said Representative Frank Pallone Jr  of New Jersey  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee   Well  now is your chance to show it  A federal judge in Texas invalidated all of the Affordable Care Act in December  Last week the Trump administration told the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  in New Orleans  that it agreed with the judge s decision  California and other states that support the Affordable Care Act have appealed the decision If the entire law is struck down  millions of people could lose coverage provided through the expansion of Medicaid and through private insurance subsidized by the federal government ImageRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California  the House Republican leader  called the House resolution an empty gesture   This will do nothing for your health care   he said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesRepublicans have voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act  and many were reluctant this week to criticize the position taken in court by the Trump administration  But they said they would be ready to respond if the law falls to a legal challenge  If the court strikes down the Affordable Care Act  Republicans will act to protect those with pre existing conditions   said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas  the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee   We will work to make health care more affordable  guaranteeing that folks can see local doctors or go to their local hospitals  and we will preserve other important provisions  such as no lifetime limits and allowing kids to stay on their parents  plans until age 26  At the same time  Mr  Brady called the existing health law unconstitutional and called the resolution criticizing the Justice Department a  political stunt  The House Energy and Commerce Committee is working on legislation to hold down insurance costs and reverse what Democrats describe as the administration s efforts to sabotage the health law But Senate Republicans have been badly divided as they consider a response to Mr  Trump s announcement late Monday on Twitter that the party was  developing a really great HealthCare Plan  to replace the Affordable Care Act Some  averse to an election year fight on the issue  have said they would wait to see what Mr  Trump might propose  Some have praised him for raising the issue again  Back home  what we have right now is an unmitigated disaster   said Senator David Perdue  Republican of Georgia   As an elected official  it s our responsibility to bring solutions  And what President Trump is saying is that if Congress is gridlocked right now  which it is on this topic  then he wants to start a dialogue about what it is he stands for  And I applaud that  But Mr  Trump pulled back his request for a health law replacement after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  told him no such legislation would be coming before the 2020 election Opinion polls show that Democrats have a political advantage on health care  Asked why voters should trust Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act  after they failed in 2017  Senator Ron Johnson  Republican of Wisconsin  said   I would understand their skepticism  The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the health law s requirement for people to have insurance   the individual mandate   as an exercise of Congress s taxing power  Judge Reed O Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth ruled that the requirement became unconstitutional after Congress brought that tax penalty to zero in the tax cut signed by Mr  Trump in 2017  and he said that other provisions of the law could not survive because they were inextricably linked to the mandate Two Republican state attorneys general  Dave Yost of Ohio and Tim Fox of Montana  filed a legal brief this week saying there was  no basis  to strike down the whole law just because the individual mandate was unconstitutional They said the mandate could be severed from the health law without throwing out other provisions  like the protections for people with pre existing conditions  The Justice Department under Mr  Trump initially said that the mandate and the protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down  But last week  the department went further and said it agreed with the Texas judge who ruled the entire law was invalid  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Wednesday to rein in what the administration calls the  Wild West  of online trafficking in counterfeit goods The memorandum is aimed at stopping the sale of counterfeit products on sites like Amazon  eBay and China s e commerce leader  Alibaba  This president has decided that it s time to clean up this Wild West of counterfeiting and trafficking   said Peter Navarro  director of the White House National Trade Council  The central core of the problem is that right now  third party online marketplaces     have zero liability when it comes to trafficking in these counterfeit goods  That simply has to stop  We are going to attack that on numerous fronts  In a statement released on Wednesday  Amazon said that it  strictly prohibits  the sale of counterfeit products and welcomes more coordinated support from law enforcement to stem the problem  Amazon said that last year it spent more than  400 million fighting counterfeits  fraud and other forms of abuse  We have built industry leading tools like Brand Registry  Transparency and our newly launched Project Zero to protect our customers and help rights owners drive counterfeits to zero   the company said   With these and other tools  we ensure that over 99  of the products that customers view on Amazon never receive a complaint about counterfeits  Navarro said discussion of possible actions the administration will take to deter online trafficking in counterfeit merchandise is premature  He says the directive orders the Department of Homeland Security to work with other agencies on a report identifying the scope of the problem  The report also is to identify the origin of the fake goods and recommend administrative  regulatory  legislative or policy changes to stem the problem Alibaba also released a statement saying it would welcome the administration s work to combat counterfeiting  The company said it has developed systems to protect intellectual property and has worked with brand name companies  law enforcement  consumers and trade associations to battle the problem The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that the value of trade in counterfeit and pirated goods is about a half trillion dollars a year  with roughly 20  infringing on U S  intellectual property  according to the directive The U S  is engaged in a trade dispute with China after the Trump administration made several complaints  including that China was stealing U S  trade secrets and was forcing companies to give them technology to access its market  Trump imposed tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese imports  about half what the United States buys from that country  China retaliated with tariffs on about  110 billion of U S  items  Trade talks are ongoing Navarro told reporters in a conference call  however  that the new memorandum has nothing to do with the U S  China trade talks or Trump s criticism of Amazon owner  Jeff Bezos  Trump has accused Amazon of not paying its fair share of taxes  harming the U S  Postal Service and putting brick and mortar stores out of business A recent Government Accountability Office report examined four categories of frequently counterfeited goods  and  based on a small sample of these goods purchased through various online third party marketplaces  investigators found that more than 40  were counterfeit  Navarro said    AP Retail Writer Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   In President Donald Trump s estimation  the 2020 census will be pointless unless a question is added that asks people if they are citizens That opinion makes him a distinct outlier in government  business and society  where the big census conducted every 10 years produces a gold mine of information on how people live and  of course  how many there are TRUMP   Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question  Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together     tweet Monday THE FACTS  Trump s disdain for conducting the once a decade census without a citizenship question is not shared by his own Census Bureau researchers  Nor is it consistent with the many operations of government and business that make billions of dollars in spending decisions as well as policy decisions based on the most accurate possible count of the U S  population According to January 2018 calculations by the Census Bureau  adding a citizenship question to the decennial census form would cause lower response rates among noncitizens  leading to an increased cost to the government of at least  27 5 million for additional phone calls  visits to the home and other follow up efforts to reach them  The Constitution requires a count every 10 years of  the whole number of persons in each state   long understood to include all residents of the U S The count goes to the heart of the U S  political system  It s used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House and how the electoral votes that decide presidential elections are distributed It also shapes how 300 federal programs distribute more than  800 billion a year to local communities  according to an analysis by the GW Institute of Public Policy at George Washington University  Communities and businesses depend on it  as well  in deciding where to build schools  hospitals  job training centers  grocery stores and more The GW institute s analysis of the effects of an undercount on five programs administered by the Health and Human Services Department  for instance  found that 37 states lost a median of  1 091 in the 2015 budget year for each person missed in the 2010 census Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has argued that a citizenship question is needed   or is  very important   as Trump puts it   to help the government better comply with the Voting Rights Act  But the Justice Department has been enforcing the 1965 law  which was passed to help protect minority groups  political rights  with citizenship data already available from other government surveys Meantime  civil rights groups and states with higher shares of immigrant populations such as California and New York cite a greater harm to the political rights of minority groups if a citizenship question in the decennial census dissuades immigrants from participating  resulting in diminished representation in the U S  House Not since 1950 has the census collected citizenship data from the whole population The Supreme Court this month is hearing the Trump administration s appeal of a federal judge s ruling in New York that Ross  whose department oversees the census  violated federal law by making an  arbitrary and capricious  decision that twisted contrary evidence  A judge in California also has ruled that a citizenship question would violate the Constitution s requirement to count the population    Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

WASHINGTON   For Donald Trump  the rigid rules of golf are flexible  allowing for the kick of a wayward ball into a better location  skipping a putt that looks close enough  What s the big deal That is according to Rick Reilly  a former Sports Illustrated columnist who has just written the book  Commander in Cheat   which alleges Trump is guilty of all sorts of sins on the golf course In an interview with Reuters on Thursday  Reilly laid out a number of accusations to support his view that the U S  president s golf game is  well  not par for the course  particularly for a president who owns a string of golf resorts Among the charges  Playing with pros Tiger Woods  Dustin Johnson and Brad Faxon in November 2017  Trump hit two balls in the water on one hole but didn t charge himself any penalty strokes The pros all saw it happen  but just grinned their way through it  Why didn t they call him out for the violation  Because he s so fun and we want our own stories to tell about the cheating   Reilly said he was told At Winged Foot  a famous golf club in Westchester County  New York  Trump had a reputation among the caddies for kicking his ball into a better position so often that they called him  Pele   the former soccer star  Reilly said While Trump has in the past claimed a golf handicap of 2 8  meaning he typically will average three strokes over par over 18 holes  his handicap is actually about 10  said Reilly  This idea that Donald Trump is a great golfer   he s not   said Reilly   He s good  He s a 72 year old man who s a 10 handicap  That s pretty good  But why isn t that good enough  One time Democrat Hillary Clinton  who Trump defeated in the 2016 election  had her brother  Hugh Rodham  to play a round at Winged Foot but showed up wearing shorts and was told he had to have long pants  Reilly said Rodham ended up wearing Trump s rain pants in order to meet the dress code  and gave them back when he was done  This didn t sit well with Trump when he found out about it  Somebody tells Trump this and he was so mad he made the club buy him a whole new rain suit   said Reilly Reilly said the point of the book is to show what Trump is really like behind the scenes  Golf is a window into a guy s soul and this gives a pretty good view of the guy   he said The White House declined to comment   Reporting by Steve Holland  Editing by Susan Thomas

his brand is faring in one important metric  his  E Score   a number compiled by E Poll Market Research that is not publicly available  but which marketing executives  network television stations and

AUSTIN  Texas   The Texas Senate has approved a resolution supporting President Donald Trump s assertion that there is an immigration  crisis  on the U S  Mexico border The non binding language was introduced on the floor by Houston Republican Sen  Paul Bettencourt on Tuesday Outnumbered Democrats said they were blindsided and complained bitterly during hours of heated debate   but they didn t have the votes to stop it The purely ceremonial resolution stated that the  Texas Senate supports the president in his efforts to move forward with emergency action  on the border Still  lawmakers had previously largely avoided thorny immigration debates  despite Texas  1 200 mile border with Mexico The U S  House and Senate voted against Trump s use of emergency power to build a border wall  but he vetoed the resolution and Congress was unable to override him

President Trump  in his most recent rebuke of Central American nations for what he says is their failure to address the issue of migration  announced plans to cut off aid to three nations   Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador   known as the Northern Triangle  Critics of the cuts say they will target programs aimed at preventing violence  curbing extreme poverty and hunger  and strengthening the justice system   the very problems residents of those countries give for leaving home and pursuing a more stable future elsewhere  Though the administration has offered little in the way of details about what precisely could be cut  the State Department notified Congress on Friday night that it would divert about  450 million in aid from the region  President Trump also threatened to seal off the southern border of the United States with Mexico if that country  doesn t get with it  So what s really at stake  and what types of programs could these cuts affect in each nation  The United States Agency for International Development describes the multiyear Strategy for Central America  which is responsible for dispersing much of this aid  as focused on institutional reforms and developmental challenges that drive migration  The programs it supports enhance security  improve governance and promote prosperity  Here are some examples of programs financed by American dollars in the three countries targeted by President Trump  ImageCoffee Mill worker Rosa Gonzalez  left  sorts coffee beans on a conveyor belt at Fedecocagua  a coffee mill outside of Guatemala City  as the

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump told House Republicans on Tuesday that they need to embrace health care reform and make it the first thing they vote on following the 2020 election Speaking at an annual fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump told GOP lawmakers and supporters they have the advantage on a variety of issues  but conceded that Democrats have the advantage on health care  We have to take that away from them   Trump said  Republicans should not run away from health care   he added   You can t do it  You re going to get clobbered  He told the GOP House members   You are the minority  I hate to say  That s not going to last long   Democrats hold a 235 197 majority in the House with three vacancies The Democrats found success in 2018 by attracting support from women  minorities and college educated voters  particularly in suburban districts  Many wanted a check on the president  That success filtered down to state and local races  with Democrats flipping hundreds of seats in state legislatures and picking up seven governorships To turn that momentum  Trump is focusing on the economy and casting Democrats as outside the mainstream in their support for policies such as  Medicare for all  and the  Green New Deal  to combat climate change  If they beat me with the Green New Deal  I deserve to lose   he said The buzzword for Republicans is  socialism   and Trump turned to it on several occasions Tuesday night Still  he said some of the Democrats  proposals could prove enticing to votes in the short term  He said free health care sounds very seductive  Don t underestimate the power of socialism to get a vote   Trump said  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is  fully behind  Stephen Moore  his choice to help lead the Federal Reserve  despite unflattering details that have come to light about Moore s personal life  a top White House official said Wednesday while also complaining about Washington s  toxic  environment  I spoke to the president yesterday  He completely supports Steve  I certainly do  People are being awful hard on him     This town is a toxic town in some respects   Larry Kudlow  director of the National Economic Council  told reporters   So we are fully behind him  fully behind him  Kudlow said Moore is  a smart guy  who  would be a breath of fresh air on the Fed  and so far it s all systems go  Moore is a former Trump campaign adviser who helped design massive tax cuts the president signed into law in 2017  He has been affiliated with multiple conservative groups  including as the Heritage Foundation s chief economist  leading some economists to say Moore could inject politics into an institution that strives to keep decisions about monetary policy free of political influence Moore has taken a series of controversial stances on the Fed  and has acknowledged the need to learn more about how the central bank works He also has said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell should be fired for rate hikes last year that Moore claims undermined the benefits from Trump s tax cuts  Trump has also publicly come down hard on Powell over those increases  The Fed recently announced it will not raise interest rates in 2019  a decision Powell said was not influenced by the president Trump has yet to forward Moore s nomination to serve on the Fed s Board of Governors to the Senate for confirmation  His required background check has yet to be completed According to published reports and court records  Moore had a lien of more than  75 000 filed against him in January 2018 for unpaid taxes  and has fallen behind on alimony and child support payments to his ex wife After Trump s announcement in March  Moore said his criticisms of the Fed  including his suggestion about dismissing Powell  were likely written  in a time of anger  While the Fed s recent actions have been more in line with the easy credit stance the administration is seeking  Trump has made sharp attacks on the central bank at recent meetings  according to a report Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal  The newspaper quoted an unnamed source present at one of the meetings as saying that Trump told the group that he told Powell during a recent telephone conversation   I guess I m stuck with you  Asked about that comment during his appearance at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor  Kudlow said he thought it was an  expression of love and affection  on the part of the president Under the law that governs the Federal Reserve  a president can only remove a Fed chairman for cause  Courts in cases that involved other agencies that use similar language have interpreted it to exclude policy differences On the separate issue of tariffs  Kudlow said Trump would veto legislation being considered by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley  R Iowa  that  among other things  would scale back the president s virtually unlimited power to impose tariffs on imports he declares a threat to national security  The president is not in favor of that at the moment  Not in favor of that   Kudlow said  He added that the president believes imposing tariffs  or even merely threatening to impose them  gives him the upper hand in trade talks with other countries  China most notably Trump slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports last year and believes China would not currently be negotiating a trade deal with the U S  had he not imposed the levies  Kudlow said A Chinese delegation is in Washington this week for another round of talks  following a U S  team s trip to Beijing last week for discussions    AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report

WASHINGTON   White House adviser Ivanka Trump is planning a trip to Africa to promote a global women s initiative she s leading President Donald Trump s daughter will visit Ethiopia and Ivory Coast over four days this month  The White House said Wednesday that her schedule includes a women s economic empowerment summit in Ivory Coast as well as site visits and meetings with political leaders  executives and female entrepreneurs in both countries Accompanying her will be Mark Green  administrator of the U S  Agency for International Development  On parts of the trip  they will be joined David Bohigian  acting president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  as well as Kristalina Georgieva  interim president of the World Bank Group  which is hosting the summit OPIC provides loans  loan guarantees and political risk insurance  funding projects that stretch across continents and industries It will be Ivanka Trump s first visit to Africa since the White House undertook the Women s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative in February  In a statement to The Associated Press  she said she was  excited to travel to Africa  to advance the effort Georgieva said in a statement that economic empowerment  can help unleash the enormous potential of women entrepreneurs for job creation and economic growth  especially in Africa  The initiative involves the State Department  the National Security Council and other U S  agencies  It aims to coordinate current programs and develop new ones to assist women in job training  financial support  legal or regulatory reforms and other areas Ivanka Trump says the goal is to economically empower 50 million women in developing countries by 2025 Money for the effort will come through USAID  which initially set up a  50 million fund using dollars already budgeted  The president s 2020 budget proposal requests  100 million for the initiative  which will also be supported by programs across the government as well as private investment  The White House spending plan would cut overall funding for diplomacy and development Ivanka Trump has made women s economic empowerment a centerpiece of her White House portfolio  She has made a number of international trips  with a focus on these issues  including to Japan and India  Her travel to Africa follows a five day tour that first lady Melania Trump made there last year  with a focus on child welfare Like the first lady  Ivanka Trump s efforts could be complicated by the president  who was criticized last year after his private comments about  s   hole countries  in Africa and other regions were leaked to journalists  

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Monday hosted about 300 guests  including convicted felons  at the White House for the  First Step Act Celebration   a party intended to bring attention to a rare piece of bipartisan legislation he passed last year  and which he plans to highlight on the campaign trail The East Room celebration capped a day of events dedicated to overhauling the criminal justice system  an issue that agencies across the government have been asked to elevate The labor secretary  Alexander Acosta  participated in a panel on work force development  Ben Carson  the secretary of Housing and Urban Development  led a session about prisoner re entry  Ivanka Trump  the president s daughter and senior adviser  weighed in at a session dealing with incarcerated women  Kim Kardashian  the reality TV star  was even invited to participate in the panels and the party  but could not attend Months after the legislation passed  and amid foreign policy blunders and a defeat on funding a wall along the southern border  Mr  Trump s administration is putting the issue front and center  As president  I pledged to work with both parties for the good of the whole nation   Mr  Trump said at the East Room gathering  pointing to the legislation as an example of bipartisan work that he said was  so important to me  But some activists who helped work on the legislation   which would expand job training and early release programs  and modify sentencing laws  including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders   have expressed concern that Mr  Trump is more attuned to the political opportunities the law offers him  rather than with ensuring it is enacted effectively Mr  Trump s budget  released last month  listed only  14 million to pay for the First Step Act s programs  The law passed in December specifically asked for  75 million a year for five years  beginning in 2019  The funding gap was first reported by The Marshall Project The Office of Management and Budget  however  noted that the bill passed after the budget had already been finalized and that there was always an understanding that funding for the First Step Act would be revisited  On Monday night  Mr  Trump said that  my administration intends to fully fund and implement this historic law   It was the line that many concerned advocates had been hoping to hear  The answer is a resounding yes  We re fully committed to doing that   Ja Ron Smith  a White House adviser who has worked extensively on putting the First Step Act in place  said in an interview  referring to the funding In a budget justification document  the Bureau of Prisons  which operates under the Justice Department  said that it had not concluded how much money would be required to put the First Step Act into effect  But it went on to say that fulfilling the law was a  priority  and that the Bureau of Prisons  budget for re entry activities  will be prioritized to fully fund the requirements of the act  The document also noted that the prison bureau planned to dedicate  147 million in the 2020 fiscal year to First Step Act related activities  which include the cost of expanding halfway housing  the cost to relocate people and  85 million for the Second Chance Act grant program  which aids states and nonprofits in reducing recidivism Despite the assurances from the president on down that the changes remain a budget priority  questions about funding have advocates on the issue concerned and keeping up public pressure  The First Step Act cannot fulfill its promise of turning federal prisons toward rehabilitation and preparing men and women to come home job ready if it is not fully funded   said Jessica Jackson Sloan  national director of  Cut50  a prisoner advocacy group that worked closely with the White House to get the legislation passed  Ms  Sloan said the group had been meeting with appropriators and talking to White House officials for months  to ensure that the proper funding is requested and appropriated  Others who have worked on the issue said it still remained to be seen whether the White House would push for full funding when it comes time to work out appropriations in a spending bill  and whether there would be an effort to make the Justice Department comply with it  I hope that the president s budget has been amended to specifically fund First Step  but there is so much that needs to be done after that   said Holly Harris  the executive director of Justice Action Network  which has worked with a bipartisan group on criminal justice overhaul efforts   We need the president to lean in hard on his allies in Congress  Ms  Harris noted that her group continued  to be skeptical  that officials at the Justice Department would prioritize the issue  It was not a priority for Jeff Sessions  the first attorney general in the Trump administration  who fought Jared Kushner  the president s son in law  on making it one  But his successor  William P  Barr  said in his confirmation hearing that he would fully carry out and support the law  Mr  Barr has also met with Mr  Kushner at the White House and understands that it is a priority for top officials  White House officials said Mr  Kushner helped persuade the president to get behind the prison reform measure last year  by assuring him that it had the backing of conservatives and that it was also popular with African American voters  whose support for the president was anemic in his 2016 campaign At a campaign rally in Grand Rapids  Mich   last week  Mr  Trump described the First Step Act as legislation that politicians had been trying to do  for so many years  He added a dig at his opposition   While we are pushing and pursuing all of these common sense policies to advance the common good for our citizens  Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism  resistance and revenge  The kickoff party on Monday offered Mr  Trump an opportunity for a photo op with the convicted felons  many of whom were African American  as his campaign advisers want him to expand his appeal beyond his base  Mr  Trump called many of the First Step Act beneficiaries up to the microphone to speak  where they grew emotional and thanked him for signing the legislation Many Democratic lawmakers and prison advocacy groups were happy to work with the Trump administration on the legislation  despite early skepticism about Mr  Trump s commitment to the issue  Some of them  like Representative Josh Gottheimer  Democrat of New Jersey  attended the event at the White House on Monday evening  and were even name checked by Mr  Trump  But what has to accompany that  obviously  is ensuring that the bill is implemented   Ms  Harris said  

ANNAPOLIS  Md    In a countermeasure to a proposed Trump administration rule  Maryland would become the first state to stop participating in a federal family planning program known as Title X  under a bill that received final approval Wednesday in the Maryland General Assembly The Maryland Senate voted 28 16 for the measure  sending the bill to Republican Gov  Larry Hogan  whose spokesman said the governor would review the bill before deciding whether to sign it The rule proposed by President Donald Trump would prohibit family planning clinics funded by the program from making abortion referrals  Critics denounce that as a  gag rule   The Maryland measure would prevent the state s health department from accepting Title X money if it s conditioned on excluding family planning providers and medically approved services  Maryland is very fortunate that our legislators safeguard a woman s right to access family planning services   said Karen Nelson  CEO of Planned Parenthood of Maryland   Our state has to step in far too often to fulfill the responsibility of the federal government  Sen  Bryan Simonaire  a Republican who voted against the bill  said it was bad policy  because it would prevent federal money from flowing into the state that could help faith based organizations provide health services  He described the debate over the bill as  a turf battle protecting one group against another   and expressed support for the administration s rule  It protects Title X health care providers so they are not required to choose between participating in the program and violating their own consciences by providing abortion counseling and referrals  and that s really what s at the heart of this   Simonaire said of the administration s rule change The Title X program  enacted in 1970  makes family planning services available to low income individuals for free or at low cost Sen  Ron Young  a Democrat who supported the bill  said no organizations are being shut out  because they can apply directly to the federal government for funding  It is our policy that family planning should be allowed to discuss the full range of family planning  which is what you can do at the organizations that we support through the state   Young said   If we were to accept these funds  it would be going against our state policy of full planning  The state would fund Maryland s Family Planning Program at the same level as the previous year  Maryland approved legislation in 2017 that created a state funded family planning program in the event of changes at the federal level  Hogan did not veto the bill  but it became law without his signature Maryland recently joined more than a dozen states that have filed lawsuits against the administration over the rule Religious conservatives and abortion opponents contend that Title X has been used to indirectly subsidize Planned Parenthood  the leading abortion provider in the U S Groups such as National Right to Life Committee  an organization that opposes abortion  have praised the Trump administration rule  saying it does not cut funding  but  merely ensures that health facilities receiving Title X funds do not perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning   

The House Intelligence Committee has asked one of the top contractors to President Trump s inaugural to provide it with documents about the event  a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday  opening up a new line of inquiry into the planning and financing of the ceremonies The committee asked for documents from and an interview with Stephanie Winston Wolkoff  who had been a close friend of the first lady  Melania Trump  and who had helped plan the celebrations and parties around the inaugural  the person said  The request was disclosed by a lawyer for Ms  Winston Wolkoff in a letter this week to the inaugural committee It is unclear what was requested  or why the intelligence committee is now involved  But it adds a new layer to the existing federal investigations into the inaugural committee  which was run by Thomas J  Barrack  a close friend of the president  with help from some former Trump political aides  They include Rick Gates  who previously pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  and who has been cooperating with various investigations for more than a year In February  federal prosecutors issued a subpoena to the inaugural committee demanding that it turn over documents about donors  finances and activities  The subpoena sought documents related to all of the committee s donors and guests  any benefits handed out  including tickets and photo opportunities with the president  federal disclosure filings  vendors and contracts Among other issues  federal prosecutors have been investigating whether foreigners illegally funneled donations to Mr  Trump s inaugural committee and a pro Trump super PAC in hopes of buying influence over American policy  according to people familiar with the inquiry The inquiry has been looking at whether people from Middle Eastern nations   including Qatar  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates   used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two funds  Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns  political action committees and inaugural funds A spokesman for the intelligence committee  Patrick Boland  declined to comment on the request it made for documents from Ms  Winston Wolkoff  Representative Adam Schiff  the California Democrat who is chairman of the committee  has said that the panel would investigate any  financial or other leverage  that  foreign actors  might have over Mr  Trump and his administration The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III A lawyer for Ms  Winston Wolkoff declined to comment  The Wall Street Journal reported the request from the intelligence committee on Wednesday Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have been investigating donors to and spending by the inaugural committee since last year Their investigation was prompted by a recording between Ms  Winston Wolkoff and Michael D  Cohen  the president s former personal lawyer and fixer  that the prosecutors found on Mr  Cohen s cellphone  In a separate case brought by those prosecutors  Mr  Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging hush money payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Mr  Trump Ms  Winston Wolkoff has been cooperating with that probe since last fall  earlier than inaugural officials knew  according to the letter from her lawyer A sealed court order prohibited Ms  Winston Wolkoff from disclosing the fact that she received a subpoena from the federal prosecutors in Manhattan  That order  which lasted for 180 days  recently expired  a person briefed on the letter from her lawyer said Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York  in Brooklyn  have also been looking into questions about donations to the Trump inaugural committee  They have been examining Mr  Barrack s ties to the Middle East  among other matters  according to the people briefed on the work The inaugural committee raised  107 million and spent more freely than those of previous presidents  In 72 days  it spent about  100 million  roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Presidents Barack Obama or George W  Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurations Ms  Winston Wolkoff  with a partner  set up a firm that oversaw broadcast rights for the inaugural events and worked on the documentary project featuring interviews with top inaugural committee officials

NEW YORK   News industry leaders are fighting back against the charge by President Donald Trump and his supporters that the administration s summation of special counsel Robert Mueller s report proved that journalists were  so wrong for so long  in their coverage of the Russia investigation The latest to weigh in was Steve Coll  dean of Columbia University s Graduate School of Journalism  who wrote in a New Yorker magazine essay this week that it s wrong to conclude journalism failed because Mueller did not charge Trump with conspiring with Russians to influence the 2016 election  The New York Times and The Washington Post shared a Pulitzer Prize  awarded by Columbia in 2018  for their reporting on the issue  a prize Trump says should be taken away Complicating the issue is the broad definition of the news media circa 2019  encompassing everything from painstakingly sourced investigative stories to overheated tweets to opinionated pundits  It s premature to pronounce this coverage as some kind of epic press failure   said Nancy Gibbs  former Time magazine editor and a Harvard University professor of press  politics and public policy  People angered by the press  role in investigating the president will use Mueller s findings as a lever in any way they can  she said  That doesn t mean that they re right   Gibbs said The phrase  so wrong for so long  was used by White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney during a CNN appearance on Sunday  He said  we need to figure out  what happened with reporting on the story  Sean Davis  co founder of the Federalist online magazine  said the same thing in the lead of a Wall Street Journal editorial earlier in the week that argued  America s blue chip journalists botched the entire story   The president retweeted his story  I m not sure what you re saying the media got wrong   replied CNN s Jake Tapper   The media reported the investigation was ongoing  Other than the people in the media on the left  not on this network  I don t know anybody who got anything wrong  We didn t say there was conspiracy  We said that Mueller was investigating conspiracy  Mulvaney  without offering specifics  said to Tapper that  if that s your recollection of history  that s great  Face it  the media got this wrong   he said   It s OK  people get stuff wrong all the time  Just not at this level  There were obviously disputed individual stories along the way  ABC suspended Brian Ross for a story wrongly alleging that Trump had asked former national security adviser Michael Flynn to discuss foreign policy with the Russians before he was elected  Three CNN journalists resigned over a story falsely linking a Trump aide to a Russian investment fund  The special counsel s office denied a Buzzfeed report that it had evidence Trump had directed lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress over a Moscow office project Yet much of what the public learned over the past two years on the story was the result of relentless digging by reporters In tweets over the past week  Trump repeated his contention that the mainstream media is the enemy of the people  and said the Times  and Post s Pulitzers should be stripped  The Times  in response  tweeted a picture of its Pulitzer winners and noted that every story cited in their prize winning entry has been proven correct Top editors at the Times and Post  Dean Baquet and Marty Baron  and CNN chief Jeff Zucker offered similar statements noting it was their organizations  job to show what people in power are doing  and prosecutors  responsibility to determine what is legal or illegal  A sitting president s own Justice Department investigated his campaign for collusion with a hostile nation   Zucker said   That s not enormous because the media says so  That s enormous because it s unprecedented  Not every top news executive was eager to get involved  representatives for news presidents at ABC  CBS and NBC either turned down or didn t reply to interview requests   We re going to keep doing our job   MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement  The coverage of the investigation did include embarrassments   specious chyrons  tendentious talking heads and retracted scoops  among them   Columbia s Coll wrote   Yet it does not follow that American journalism failed because the best resourced newsrooms in the nation chose to report assiduously on the Mueller investigation and its subjects  only to learn that Mueller did not prove that Trump had conspired with Russia  If there s any media soul searching to be done  it may involve cable news  In the Trump era  Fox News and MSNBC are frequently the most watched cable networks in general  both appealing to different camps Fox News Channel s Sean Hannity has been Trump s biggest advocate on cable news  making him a target for the president s opponents  Yet MSNBC s Rachel Maddow was criticized this week by Slate s Willa Paskin  who said turning on her show  was like discovering a Facebook friend is on the verge of a nervous breakdown   She said that while Maddow s audience was not as malignant as Hannity s   more than one cable news host can disservice their audience at the same time  Harvard s Gibbs recalls watching reporters and pundits sitting side by side on cable panels  with roles confused when pundits were asked what they were hearing and reporters questioned about what they thought Journalists have long believed that readers and viewers understand the difference between reporting and commentary  Coll said  It would be unrealistic to expect them to make such a distinction

The Trump administration s decision to cut off aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras to punish their governments for failing to curb migration is a rash response to a real policy dilemma  Cutting off aid will needlessly deepen tensions between Congress and the administration  and it will exacerbate migration from the region without twisting Central American politicians  arms  But we shouldn t pretend that the aid itself was doing much good   in fact  the best move right now would be to significantly change the way aid to Central America is structured  to push those countries to alleviate the political  economic and social pressures driving people north in the first place Immigration fueled tensions between Congress and the White House are likely to reach a new high as a result of the decision to cut off aid to Central America  The president s declaration of a state of emergency to build his wall already triggered a battle over the power to legislate  that fight will now grow to include the power of the purse  The potential cost is greater than heightened acrimony  As each side will surely dig in its heels  sensible immigration and foreign policies  such as bipartisan efforts to address the rising number of asylum seekers or to prevent Guatemala from sliding into authoritarianism  will get lost in the scuffle The decision to cut off aid is bound to drive up migration numbers  American aid to Central America has a lot of problems  Its total amounts are paltry  and it is mostly distributed inefficiently in large blocks by foreign contractors  Nonetheless  that aid is about the only outside support available to Central American governments confronting relentless poverty and violence  And some of the aid does work  There is good evidence that violence prevention assistance to El Salvador has contributed to a decrease in the homicide rate  a likely factor behind the drop in migration to the United States ImagePeople waiting at the border crossing in Nuevo Laredo  Mexico  to apply for asylum sometimes stay at this overcrowded migrant shelter for weeks  even months CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesCutting off foreign assistance is unlikely to persuade Central American governments to take actions that reduce the migratory flow  The amount of aid provided pales in comparison with revenue accrued through migrant remittances  The  500 million sent to these countries in 2017 was less than 3 percent of the money received as remittance each year  And as Venezuela has shown  the United States isn t the only source of support   Mr  Trump s aid cutoff simply opens the door for China or Russia  Governments of the region  especially of Guatemala and  to a lesser degree  of Honduras  are indifferent to the plight of their poor who migrate  Especially as these governments turn increasingly authoritarian and criminal  they are more than happy to rid their countries of real and prospective opponents  For too long  Central American governments and elites have gotten away with abdicating their fiduciary  social and legal responsibilities to their citizens  They have failed to collect tax revenue and to invest in social programs and job creation that alleviate the plight of their poor  And they have aligned themselves with vast organized criminal networks  These networks  acting either independently or in alliance with increasingly sophisticated gangs  are responsible for terrorizing community members into fleeing their countries and for transforming migration into a lucrative criminal enterprise If the Trump administration is serious about forcing the hand of Central American governments  it can t just cut off aid   an alternative policy approach is urgently required  Rather than turn a blind eye to creeping authoritarianism  it should pressure governments to become more democratic and less beholden to corrupt elites and criminal networks ImageEl Salvador s president elect  Nayib Bukele  at the Heritage Foundation in Washington in March CreditEric Baradat Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThere could not be a more opportune or urgent moment to do so  particularly in El Salvador and Guatemala  Mr  Trump should reach out to the Salvadoran president elect  Nayib Bukele  and help him make good on his campaign promise to ensure transparency by establishing a commission to investigate corruption and criminality  Timing is even more critical in Guatemala  Congress has already pushed the country s government to improve accountability by revoking the visas of corrupt public officials and business people  The administration should embrace and further these efforts  especially in the run up to elections this year  in which several factions are trying to block the candidacy of Thelma Aldana  a crusading former attorney general  for president In all of these cases  American aid can be used both as a carrot to promote reform and as a support mechanism to help politicians like Ms  Aldana achieve needed reform  As sometimes happens with this administration  Mr  Trump is half right  American aid is not working  and Central American governments need to be called to account for their mismanagement  But ending that aid will just make everything worse  Instead of being a giveaway  it needs to be structured as an incentive for domestic reform  Not only will that cut down on migration  but it will help give Central Americans what they have been longing for  a safe and prosperous region where they can imagine a future for their children Read moreOpinion articles on

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Thursday he recommended former pizza chain executive and Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board Trump told reporters at the White House that Cain is going through checks  and he imagines he will be in good shape   Reporting by Jeff Mason  Writing by Doina Chiacu  Editing by Chris Reese  

WASHINGTON   After two years of playing coy  the Trump administration is reportedly finally ready to unveil its plan for Israeli Palestinian peace  The plan s details remain confidential  but if it is anything like President Trump s moves so far on the Israeli Palestinian issue  it will be bold Some of those steps have worked out far better than the president s critics anticipated  Moving the United States  embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  for example  failed to elicit the protests in the wider Arab world many predicted  even as Israelis celebrated it as correcting a historical injustice Another of the administration s bold strokes has been to all but eliminate the United States  once considerable aid to Palestinians  And while that has attracted far less attention than the embassy move  it is likely to prove more consequential for American and Israeli interests  and for the president s hoped for deal   and not for the better Until recently  Palestinians were one of the largest recipients of American aid  Then  in August  the Trump administration announced it would not make about  300 million in payments due to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency  or Unrwa  which provides schooling  housing and other services to those it designates as refugees in Gaza and elsewhere  Around the same time  the State Department also revealed that it was cutting about  230 million in other aid to the Palestinians  ending support for programs bringing together Palestinian and Israeli children and hospitals in East Jerusalem  among others This left untouched only assistance to the Palestinian security forces  long popular with both Israeli and American security officials  Yet in October  Congress adopted and Mr  Trump signed legislation that would make the Palestinian Authority  in return for accepting this and any other assistance  subject to the jurisdiction of American courts  This prompted Palestinian officials at the end of last year to reject further aid The Trump administration has good reasons to be frustrated with both the Palestinian leadership and aid organizations  Unrwa has long been accused of failing to adequately monitor its staff and the curriculum in schools that it runs for extremism  and of inflating the number of Palestinian refugees to perpetuate its mission  Mahmoud Abbas  the Palestinian Authority s president  ordered contacts with the United States frozen after the embassy move and has refused to engage with American envoys regarding the Trump administration s efforts to devise an Israeli Palestinian peace plan  The United States has made clear that the decisions on aid are meant to apply pressure on Mr  Abbas to return to the negotiating table   a goal consistent with longstanding American policy Nevertheless  the elimination of American aid to the Palestinians is unlikely to achieve that goal  In fact  in the long run  it will probably undermine both American and Israeli interests The Trump administration is right that American aid to the Palestinians provides Washington with leverage  but it is applying that leverage to the wrong end  Few observers believe that Mr  Abbas is interested in negotiating with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump  having rebuffed their less conservative predecessors or  even if negotiations resumed  that a peace deal could be reached at this time Yet aid can be leveraged to advance American aims in other ways  Past administrations have used it to strengthen the authority of Palestinian officials who favor peace and to deter the Palestinian Authority from pursuing Israel at the United Nations and in international courts  Congress has sought through the Taylor Force Act to compel the Palestinian Authority to cease the reprehensible practice of paying the families of terrorists  by reducing aid to the Palestinians by an amount equal to what the Palestinian Authority pays to families of prisoners and accused terrorists  And many supporters of Israel would have liked to see American funding for Unrwa used to compel the organization to reform  These goals have been undermined by the elimination of aid  You can t tie strings to assistance that has already been cut Aid is not just about dollars  but about engagement that confers influence  Aid programs bring American officials into contact with a wide swath of Palestinian society  which can help ensure that American influence outlasts the current leadership of the Palestinian Authority  It would be rash to assume that the vacuum left by the United States will not be filled by others  such as Russia  whose agenda in the region diverges sharply from Washington s Finally  American aid has been a stabilizing influence in both the West Bank and Gaza  Many U S A I D  programs began in the aftermath of the Second Intifada and were designed to prevent a return to such turbulence  Over the past 15 years  security assistance programs have helped build Palestinian security forces to supplant the semiofficial militias that fueled violence during the Second Intifada  These Palestinian security forces have effectively coordinated with the Israeli Army to combat terrorism in the West Bank By curtailing violence  raising standards of living and keeping children in school  American assistance has contributed to a long period of relative calm  if not peace  It is for this reason that Israeli officials have for years quietly supported its continuation Anyone who supports Israeli Palestinian peace should hope for the success of Mr  Trump s plan  But peace will ultimately require more than the agreement of leaders  It will require a Palestinian security force that can fend off those determined to use violence to derail peace efforts and a civil society that can ensure that peace is not just a top down proposition  Aid to the Palestinians   conditional and coordinated with Israel   should be a part of American policy  It could not only help President Trump s plan succeed but also ensure stability if peace efforts founder Michael Singh   MichaelSinghDC   a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the United States National

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to give Mexico a  one year warning  before closing the southern border  retreating on a threat he made last week that he would close the border in the coming days if Mexico did not halt all illegal immigration  The only thing  frankly  better and less drastic than closing the border is tariff the cars coming in  and I will do it   Mr  Trump said  speaking to reporters after a meeting with the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council   I don t play games  He added   If the drugs don t stop  or largely stop  we re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products  in particular cars   the whole ballgame is cars  And if that doesn t stop the drugs  we close the border   Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Mr  Trump cited the flow of drugs over the border as his red line  But last Friday  he announced on Twitter that  if Mexico doesn t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border  I will be CLOSING the Border  or large sections of the Border  next week  Since then  the White House has backed off that time frame for an action that would carry severe economic consequences if Mr  Trump followed through with it  Nearly  1 7 billion of goods and services flow across the United States Mexico border every day  according to the U S  Chamber of Commerce  About 500 000 legal workers  students  shoppers and tourists also cross the border daily Mr  Trump s latest reversal came after Republican lawmakers and his own economic advisers warned him of the consequences of the move  Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  said   I would hope we would not be doing that sort of thing  Furious lobbying by the president s own economic advisers and a flood of incoming data from outside groups helped to shift the president s thinking on shutting down the border  a person familiar with the situation said Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  Kevin Hassett  the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers  and their deputies communicated to the president how economically disastrous the policy would be  including the effect on daily economic growth starting within 48 hours of the closing White House officials had already been vague about the president s plans to follow through on his threat  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  told reporters this week that Mr  Trump  is not working on a specific timeline   And on Tuesday  during a meeting with Jens Stoltenberg  the NATO secretary general  the president said   I haven t made that intention known   when asked specifically about his threat to close the border this week Talking to reporters at the White House on Thursday  Mr  Trump said he was going to either close the southern border with America s third largest trading partner or  tariff the cars   He said he would  probably start off with the tariffs  But tariffs on cars coming across the southern border would largely drive up costs for American and European automakers   and their customers  Most of the cars and car parts coming from Mexico are intended for multinational automakers  including American car companies like General Motors and Ford It is also unclear the degree to which Mr  Trump could impose auto tariffs under the terms of his newly renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement  While the new deal  called the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  has yet to be ratified  it includes a provision that exempts Mexican cars from tariffs as long as they stay below a certain level of imports  Only imports above that cap  which is quite high  would be eligible for a levy  the agreement states The president is scheduled to travel to Calexico  Calif   on Friday for a photo op at a newly fortified section of the border While Mr  Trump backed off his threats to immediately close the southern border  the Department of Homeland Security has reallocated officials working at the ports of entry to handle a surge of unauthorized crossings by large groups of migrants  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said on Monday  The move has resulted in long delays and increased traffic at ports of entry Ms  Nielsen has also permitted Customs and Border Protection to reallocate as many as 2 000 officials from the ports  The move comes as more Central American families have crossed the border in recent months in search of asylum  leading to overflowing detention facilities and mass releases of migrants into cities along the border  

A coalition of states and advocacy organizations sued the Trump administration on Wednesday over its rollback of school nutritional standards championed by the former first lady Michelle Obama that required students be served healthier meals In lawsuits filed Wednesday  the groups claim that the administration illegally issued rules last year that weakened requirements that school meals contain less salt and more whole grains  The rules were part of the Healthy  Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010  a crucial part of Mrs  Obama s signature  Let s Move  campaign The suits claim the Agriculture Department violated the Administrative Procedure Act  issuing its rules with little public notice and no reasoned explanation and against overwhelming opposition from the public  The courts have already struck down a series of high profile rule changes by the administration for the same reason The coalition of states  led by New York  filed suit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York  Other states that signed on to the suit include California  Illinois  Minnesota  New Mexico  Vermont and the District of Columbia  Additionally  two advocacy organizations  Center for Science in the Public Interest and Healthy School Food Maryland  filed a similar complaint in Federal District Court in Maryland The attorney general of New York  Letitia James  announced the lawsuit outside a Brooklyn elementary school  Public School 67  which serves residents of the Ingersoll Houses  a low income apartment complex run by New York City  Ms  James said 99 percent of those students qualified for free or reduced price meals before 2017  when the city made school lunches free for all students With local officials  parents  a pediatrician and antihunger advocates at her side  Ms  James said the Trump administration  by rolling back nutritional requirements  was  attacking the health and the safety of our children   particularly the poorest  including the two million across the state who live in poverty  For many of our students  the meals they receive at school are the only hot nutritious meals they eat during the day   she said   And access to healthy and nutritious food should never be determined by your ZIP code or your socioeconomic status  Ms  James said the administration abandoned the Obama era nutritional standards without doing any scientific research beforehand  and despite the science underlying the requirements for healthier meals  which she said shows that healthier school meals can improve the overall health and school preparedness of students The advocacy organizations said the agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue s mission to  Make school meals great again  has put the health of more than 30 million students at risk  This is not just wrong  it s illegal   said Anne Harkavy  the executive director of Democracy Forward  which is representing the Center for Science in the Public Interest and Healthy School Food Maryland The Agriculture Department did not respond to a request for comment The Obama era rules  completed in 2012  kick started the administration s campaign to fight childhood obesity  starting with students  lunch trays  The rules required schools participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs to reduce the amount of sodium  serve foods rich in whole grains  increase the amount of fruits and vegetables  and limit saturated and trans fats  They also required that flavored milk be fat free In May 2017  on his first week on the job  Mr  Perdue announced he would roll back the rules  quipping   I wouldn t be as big as I am today without chocolate milk   Mr  Perdue allowed schools to request an exemption from the whole grain requirements  delay the sodium mandate and serve 1 percent flavored milk instead of nonfat In 2018  the Agriculture Department published a final rule that permanently delayed and eliminated sodium targets and cut in half the amount of whole grains that needed to be served  It also allowed schools to continue to serve low fat milk  a standard that is not challenged in the lawsuits The Agriculture Department argued that the Obama era rules were burdensome for school districts  and resulted in increased costs and decreased participation in the federal school lunch program  If kids aren t eating the food  and it s ending up in the trash  they aren t getting any nutrition   Mr  Perdue said in announcing the rollbacks He also said that he heard from students that food was less tasty  The agency wrote in an interim rule that certain states needed the flexibility to  plan and serve meals that are economically feasible and acceptable to their students and communities   and  culturally appropriate   Agriculture Department officials cited requests from states for exemptions to serve tortillas  grits and breakfast biscuits The department maintained that continually granting exemptions was unsustainable  Among those that supported the Trump administration was the School Nutrition Association  which represents school food professionals  saying that the rules were too stringent But the advocacy organizations pointed out that the overwhelming majority of public comments submitted for the 2017 rule supported keeping the original 2012 standards for sodium and whole grains  and that the Agriculture Department s own data acknowledged that nearly all schools participating in the National School Lunch Program were making progress toward meeting the requirements The lawsuits also argue that Congress mandated that science  not taste  guide federal law  For decades  Congress has required that federal nutrition standards align with government issued dietary guidelines and be rooted in other nutritional research  The suits said the department has ignored that requirement Laura MacCleery  the policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest  a food and health watchdog  said the Trump administration s effort sought to  torpedo an enormous success story that was really evolving to achieve a significant improvement in school food  A food policy adviser for New York City  Anna Bessendorf  said on Wednesday that city school meals already met or exceeded the Obama administration s 2012 standards and would continue to do so despite the Trump administration s reversals Parents at Wednesday s announcement who applauded the lawsuit said the daily reality of what the public school cafeterias served to their children was more complicated  Most of the time they hit the nail on the head   said Ayanna Behin  a community education council leader in Brooklyn whose two children  13 and 10  are in public school Nobody on hand said they had seen or heard of evidence of school lunches becoming less healthy since the Trump administration changed course Cartons of sweetened milk are still on lunch trays in New York  and Ms  James and Democracy Forward said they might challenge the milk standard in the future  The question is  will this give permission to school districts that want to backslide   said Liz Accles  the executive director of Community Food Advocates  which worked with Ms  James when she served as the city s public advocate  to push for free lunches citywide

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was prepared to close the U S  southern border if necessary but that Mexico has apprehended thousands of people in recent days and its actions have made a big difference in the immigration situation Trump threatened on Friday to close the border with Mexico this week unless Mexico took steps to help the United States with illegal immigration  a move which had threatened to overload U S  ports of entry in the region The administration softened its tone on the issue on Tuesday  saying Mexico was taking greater responsibility for dealing with the immigration flows  They have started to do a significant amount more  We ve seen them take a larger number of individuals  and hold those who have asylum claims in Mexico while they are being processed in the United States  White House spokeswoman Sanders told reporters at the White House  We ve also seen them stop more people from coming across the border so that they aren t even entering into the United States  So those two things are certainly helpful and we d like to see them continue   Sanders said Trump hinted at a softening earlier in a Twitter post on Tuesday   After many years  decades   Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border  mostly from Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador   he said He also told reporters at the White House he was still prepared to do that if necessary but that Mexico had apprehended thousands of people in recent days  having a big impact on the border situation    Reporting by Steve Holland  Writing by David Alexander  Editing by Alistair Bell

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised NATO countries for increasing their financial contributions to the Western alliance  but he hounded them to pay even more  saying America still shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of protecting Europe The president met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg  who was in Washington to mark the 70th anniversary of the organization formed to counter Russian aggression The two leaders had kind words for one another  But in the past  Trump has called NATO  obsolete  and suggested he might pull the U S  out of the alliance if member nations didn t significantly boost their defense spending  We ve worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair share   Trump told reporters   At some point  it s going to have to go higher  Trump took credit for the increased spending  However  spending by the 29 NATO countries  which dropped after the end of the Cold War  has actually been rising since 2014   before Trump took office  Prior to our getting here  NATO s spending was going way  way down   he said   It was just a one way road down  And since I became president     it s been a rocket ship up  and we have to keep it that way  After Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimean Peninsula  member countries agreed to boost defense budgets and  move toward  spending 2  of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024  The U S  spends about 3 4  of its GDP on defense Since Trump took office  European allies and Canada have added  41 billion to their defense budgets  By the end of next year  this will rise to  100 billion  Stoltenberg said  Germany  however  remains the main target of Trump s ire because it now plans to spend 1 5  by 2024  which is lower than the 2  guideline  Germany is not paying their fair share   Trump said   I have a great feeling for Germany  but they re not paying what they should be paying  We re paying for a big proportion of NATO  which is basically protecting Europe  Stoltenberg has said that the 2  guideline was not invented by the United States and was a target the 29 allies set in 2014 before Trump took office  But he thanked Trump for his  strong commitment to NATO  and for his leadership in getting member nations to increase their commitments  The allies are really stepping up   Stoltenberg said in an interview later with The Associated Press  The clear message from President Trump has helped   is having a real impact  And this is about doing what NATO allies have pledged to do  We still have a long way to go   much to do   but we have really seen very strong progress in defense spending from NATO allies  At times  Stoltenberg has served as a buffer between Trump and some European allies that he has angered Trump  who ran on an  America First  platform  slapped tariffs on the European Union  and pulled the U S  out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal  Trump s eagerness to get along with Russian leader Vladimir Putin   in spite of Russia s meddling in the 2016 U S  presidential election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years  has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat  NATO s single greatest challenge is the absence of strong  principled American presidential leadership for the first time in its history   two former U S  envoys to NATO  Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute  wrote in a report on the 70th birthday for the Harvard Kennedy School s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs Lute and Burns said NATO leaders considered not holding a 2019 summit to mark the 70th anniversary at all because they feared Trump would  blow up a meeting in controversy as he has done each time he has met with NATO leaders during the past two years   The alliance plans a scaled down summit of leaders in December that Trump is expected to attend Allies see Trump as NATO s  most urgent  and often most difficult  problem   they wrote in their report  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump  saying their conclusion was  just simply wrong  and adding that the administration has worked hard to make NATO stronger Stoltenberg is slated to address Congress on Wednesday   a first for a NATO secretary general The NATO foreign ministers  first session Thursday will focus on Russia  The ministers are expected to endorse a package of measures to improve NATO s defenses in the Black Sea Other topics will be NATO s mission in Afghanistan and Turkey s announced decision to buy a Russian surface to air missile system  Turkey is a NATO ally  but the Russian system is not compatible with NATO systems and is considered a threat to U S  F 35 aircraft They also will talk about U S  and Russian plans to withdraw this summer from a 1987 landmark arms control treaty  The U S  accuses Russia of violating the treaty  Moscow says the U S  is not in compliance If the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty is scrapped  neither Washington nor Moscow would face legal constraints on deploying land based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between 500 and 5 500 kilometers  310 to 3 410 miles   Defense officials say the Pentagon plans to begin flight tests later this year of two types of missiles that have been banned by the treaty for more than 30 years  Russia is deploying more and more of these weapons and therefore we call on Russia to come back into compliance with this treaty   Stoltenberg said    Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is suggesting he will defer until after 2020 his push for a Republican health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act Trump tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections   when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House  Republicans were cool after Trump surprised them last week with an unexpected pivot to the issue and his claims the GOP will be the party of health care  They don t yet have a comprehensive plan to replace the law  known as  Obamacare  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017  And while Republicans gained Senate seats last fall  there s no indication that GOP senators want another fight over repealing  Obamacare   particularly not those up for re election next year Health care  especially protections for people with pre existing conditions  resonates with voters and helped Democrats in the November elections According to AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide  nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care as the most important among a list of key issues  A Quinnipiac University poll last week found 55  of Americans supporting the improvement and not the replacement of the nation s health care system With Democrats controlling the House  any attempt to dismantle the law could not pass Congress Still  Trump last week appeared to commit his party to a new push for a plan to replace the health law  We are working very hard on that   Trump said as he was heading out to a Michigan rally He said Republicans  are going to work together to come up with something that s really spectacular  In his late Monday tweets  Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that  will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America  Challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts Last week  the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down  an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured and reignite a winning political issue for Democrats  

WASHINGTON   The Democratic head of a powerful U S  House committee asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of President Donald Trump s personal and business tax returns on Wednesday  in a long awaited move widely expected to lead to a long court battle with the White House The request  in a letter from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig  is viewed by Democrats in the House of Representatives as a vital first step toward oversight of Trump s income taxes and business network  which some lawmakers believe could be rife with conflicts of interest and potential tax law violations  It is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials  To maintain trust in our democracy  the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly  as laws intend   Neal said in a statement IRS and U S  Treasury officials were not immediately available for comment Trump defied decades of precedent as a presidential candidate by refusing to release the tax documents and has continued to keep them under wraps as president  saying his returns were  under audit  by the IRS  Trump s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recently testified in Congress that he did not believe the president was being audited but may have used the audit claim to avoid scrutiny that could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties  Trump was dismissive of the request but continued to make the audit argument in comments to reporters during a meeting with U S  military leaders on Wednesday   Is that all   the president asked when told Democrats wanted to see six years of his returns   Usually it s 10  so I guess they re giving up   he said   I ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name  you re audited  But until such time as I m not under audit  I would not be inclined to do that   Neal based his request on his committee s oversight jurisdiction of the IRS  specifically its alleged audits of Trump and the extent to which the agency has enforced the tax laws against the president  OVERSIGHT PRESSURECongressional Republicans oppose Neal s effort  saying such a move sets a dangerous precedent by turning the confidential tax documents of a U S  citizen into a political weapon  This particular request is an abuse of the tax writing committees  statutory authority and violates the intent and safeguards of     the Internal Revenue Code   Representative Kevin Brady  the committee s top Republican  said in a statement Independent analysts welcomed the move   The Ways and Means Committee s strongest oversight ability is making sure the IRS is operating properly   said Steve Rosenthal  a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank in Washington  It was the third time this week a Democratic led House committee exerted oversight pressure on Trump  Earlier on Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee authorized its chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full investigation report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed a former White House security chief on Tuesday Neal s committee initially planned to request only Trump s personal tax returns  But some Democrats and independent analysts pressed for them to include business returns to better gauge the president s activity in the private sector  The request includes returns for eight entities  Donald J Trump Revocable Trust  DJT Holdings LLC  DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC  DTTM Operations LLC  DTTM Operations Managing Member Corp  LFB Acquisition Member Corp  LFB Acquisition LLC and Trump National Golf Club A Democratic aide said the committee selected a manageable number of business entities that provide a vital window on Trump s business activity  Although Trump has never released his returns  the New York Times last year cited a  vast trove  of returns and financial records saying it showed he engaged in tax schemes including cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions of dollars in taxes  The White House called the report misleading    Reporting by David Morgan  Doina Chiacu and Alexandra Alper  Editing by Peter Cooney and G Crosse  

WASHINGTON   U S  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he told President Donald Trump the Senate would not be doing a comprehensive healthcare bill  even as Trump has sought to revive healthcare as an issue for the 2020 campaign  I made it clear to him  Trump  we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters  McConnell said he spoke to Trump on Monday and pointed out that with the House of Representatives in Democratic hands  it was better for the Republican run Senate to focus on matters like prescription drug pricing that were not a comprehensive effort to revisit healthcare   Reporting by Susan Cornwell  Editing by James Dalgleish

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is distorting reality when it comes to disaster aid for hurricane stricken Puerto Rico In a flurry of angry tweets Tuesday  he argues the U S  territory has gotten more than its fair share of money to rebuild after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017 He asserts the territory had already received  91 billion in aid  which is flat wrong  and readers of his tweets would not know from them that Puerto Ricans are U S  citizens TRUMP   Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane  more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before  HOGAN GIDLEY  White House spokesman   The fact is  they have received more money than any state or territory in history for a rebuild     interview Tuesday with MSNBC THE FACTS  The money Puerto Rico has received for hurricane relief is nowhere close to  91 billion  Nor is the amount provided greater than for any other hurricane that has struck the U S According to the White House  Trump s  91 billion estimate includes about  50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades  along with  41 billion already approved  But actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed more slowly from federal coffers  about  11 billion so far Even if the  91 billion figure eventually comes to fruition  it would not be the most ever provided for hurricane rebuilding efforts  Hurricane Katrina  which hit Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states in 2005  has cost the U S government more than  120 billion    TRUMP   The pols are grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA     tweet Tuesday THE FACTS  Trump appears to suggest Puerto Rico is not part of the U S  as he criticizes its territorial government for taking  from USA   He does not criticize other Americans for taking  from USA  Gidley  speaking on MSNBC  called the notion that Trump was referring to Puerto Ricans as noncitizens  absolutely ridiculous   But in the same interview Gidley had referred to Puerto Rico as  that country   When pressed about his wording  Gidley said it was a mistake and he meant to say  territory  Puerto Ricans are Americans    Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Tuesday his pressure on NATO nations to pay more for their defence is leading to tens of billions of dollars more in contributions  but the allies may need to boost their budgets even more Trump used a well worn script about burden sharing with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in talks at the White House  The meeting came a day before NATO foreign ministers sit down in Washington for what is expected to be a session dominated by concerns about Russia Trump  who has ruffled feathers among European allies by repeatedly saying that NATO nations needed to pay more and ease the burden on the United States  said his tactics have paid off  Since I came to office it s a rocket ship up  We ve picked up over  140 billion   107 billion  in additional money  and we look like we re going to have at least another  100 billion in spending by the nations   by 2020   he said The U S  president said he would like to see NATO members pay more than 2 percent of their gross domestic product for defence  Trump told NATO leaders last year to increase defence spending to 4 percent of GDP  He said the United States pays 4 3 percent of its GDP to NATO Trump singled out Germany for not doing enough  while praising German Chancellor Angela Merkel  Germany honestly is not paying their fair share   he said   They re not paying what they should be paying  They re paying close to 1 percent  The White House  in a statement  said that Trump met with Stoltenberg to mark NATO s 70th anniversary and reaffirm U S  support for the alliance  The White House said the two leaders  reviewed NATO s unprecedented progress to increase burden sharing  and also discussed  ongoing efforts to fight terrorism  and  check Russian aggression   WE LL GET ALONG WITH RUSSIA Trump said a stronger NATO provides a bulwark against Russia  but that he believed relations with Moscow will be fine  As has been his norm  Trump was reluctant to criticise Russia  I hope we have a good relationship with Russia   he said   But I think we ll get along with Russia  Stoltenberg  who is to address a joint meeting of the U S  Congress on Wednesday  singled out Russia for  violating the INF treaty   the Cold War era Intermediate range Nuclear Forces treaty Trump in February announced plans to withdraw the United States from the INF treaty this summer  saying Russia was in violation of it Russia is sowing discord in the alliance by selling to NATO member Turkey the S 400 air defence system  The United States has halted delivery of equipment related to its F 35 fighter jets to Turkey over its S 400 plans  We have very serious concerns about its stated plans to proceed with the acquisition of the S 400 missile defence system and there will be potential consequences  within sanctions law and the F 35 programme if they continue   said a senior State Department official who briefed reporters The United States says that Turkey s purchase of the Russian air defence system would compromise the security of F 35 aircraft  which is built by Lockheed Martin Corp The official  speaking on condition of anonymity to preview the meeting of NATO foreign ministers  said the gathering would discuss all elements of the military threat posed by Russia  including in the Black Sea  as well as the Afghan peace process and members  budget contributions to the alliance The official said the NATO allies would seek to agree on a package of measures to bolster NATO s military presence in the Black Sea  which has become a flashpoint with Moscow over its seizure of Ukrainian ships last year  The focus is on the defence and deterrence posture of the alliance in the Black Sea region   said the official  adding that a plenary session on Thursday would focus on Russia  including what Washington sees as Moscow s breach of the INF treaty   Reporting by Steve Holland and Lesley Wroughton  editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Leslie Adler

WASHINGTON   The U S  House of Representatives will sue to block President Donald Trump s transfer of money to pay for a border wall along the border with Mexico  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday The Republican president in February declared a national emergency at the border to secure the money that Congress refused to give him for the wall  The President s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds  an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority   Pelosi  the top Democrat in Congress  said in a statement She said a congressional legal advisory group voted to authorize the lawsuit  In a stinging rebuke  the Democratic controlled House passed legislation to terminate the emergency Trump declared at the U S  Mexico border but Trump issued the first veto of his presidency in March to block that measure  The House will once again defend our Democracy and our Constitution  this time in the courts   Pelosi said in a statement   No one is above the law or the Constitution  not even the President  U S  Attorney General William Barr said the president s emergency declaration was legal   Reporting by Doina Chiacu  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   The Republican led U S  Senate on Wednesday changed its procedures to speed up the confirmation of President Donald Trump s nominees for some lower court judgeships and sub Cabinet level positions The move to shorten debate on such nominees from 30 hours to two hours was resisted by Democrats but they could not block it because Republicans hold 53 seats in the 100 seat chamber Senator Mitch McConnell used his powers as majority leader to make the change  which will set a precedent that will apply to district court judges  the lowest rung of the judiciary  but not vacancies in the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts  The Senate has historically provided greater protection for whichever party is in the minority than the 435 seat House of Representatives by allowing longer debating time before votes and requiring 60 yes votes for most approvals  Those conventions have been whittled away by both Democrats and Republicans in recent years as the mood in Washington has become more and more polarized  however  with each party accusing the other of misusing the rules Reducing the time for debate will  begin to unwind this partisan paralysis  for the good of the Senate   McConnell said on Wednesday  Democrats slammed the procedural change  At a time when leader McConnell brags about confirming more judges than anyone has done in a very long time  he feels the need to invoke the terribly destructive and disproportionate procedure   Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Fifty three district court nominees have been confirmed during Trump s first two years in office against 44 confirmed at the same point in the presidency of Democratic President Barack Obama During Obama s presidency  Senate Democrats took steps to more easily win approval of his nominations by requiring only a simple majority vote for administration posts and judges other than Supreme Court nominees  They also limited debate to two hours  but that move expired at the end of that Congress after Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 elections  In 2017  McConnell expanded the simple majority procedure to include Supreme Court confirmations in order to overcome Democratic opposition to Trump s first nominee  Neil Gorsuch The fight over the confirmation of federal judges has been raging for years  as divisive issues before the courts include hot button issues like abortion  the death penalty and money in politics  Republicans are hoping that they can confirm as many of Trump s conservative picks as possible while they control the Senate and White House Democrats were enraged in 2016 when McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland  Obama s pick to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court At the time  McConnell said that choice should be made by whoever won the November 2016 presidential election Since he became president in January 2017  Trump has won confirmation of 37 appeals court judges  compared to 55 appeals court judge confirmations during Obama s entire eight years  Such confirmation votes would not be subject to Wednesday s procedural change  Click here to see a graphic showing Trump s appeals court appointments  https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL    Reporting By Amanda Becker and Richard Cowan  additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Lawrence Hurley  Editing by Sonya Hepinstall

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration on Wednesday will resume negotiations with China toward ending a trade war that has deepened uncertainty for businesses and investors and dimmed the outlook for the global economy The two sides are to meet for the ninth time  with analysts expressing optimism that the world s two biggest economies might be near some kind of agreement  Negotiators met in Beijing last week in talks that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as  constructive   Now  Vice Premier Liu He  a close confidante of President Xi Jinping  is leading a Chinese team to Washington  We have been encouraged by the tone of the negotiations   Myron Brilliant  head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  told reporters Tuesday Brilliant estimated that the two sides are 90  of the way to an agreement but cautioned that  the last 10  is the hardest part  the trickiest part  At the heart of the dispute are the Trump administration s allegations that China steals technology and coerces U S  companies to hand over trade secrets   all part of Beijing s zeal to overtake U S  technological dominance  To pressure China  the United States has imposed tariffs on  250 billion in Chinese goods  The Chinese have counterpunched by taxing  110 billion in U S  imports Forecasters at the World Bank and International Monetary  among others  have downgraded their outlook for the global economy  partly because the U S  China rift is damaging trade and causing businesses to slow their investment until they know how the dispute will end Tensions have eased somewhat since President Donald Trump met Xi in Buenos Aires late last year and the administration ended up suspending its plans to raise tariffs on  200 billion of the Chinese imports to buy time for negotiations We re making headway   Larry Kudlow  Trump s top economic adviser  said Tuesday  describing the talks as  a larger  grander discussion than anything we ve ever had in U S  China relations  Analysts say two major sticking points  in particular  stand in the way of any agreement First  Trump wants to preserve at least the 25  tariffs he has imposed on  50 billion in Chinese imports as a way to maintain leverage over Beijing  China wants those sanctions lifted Second  the two sides must develop a mechanism to ensure that China honors any commitments it makes in an agreement  The administration complains that China has repeatedly failed to keep promises it made in previous trade talks The Chinese are widely expected to agree to buy substantially more American products   likely including soybeans and natural gas   to help narrow the United States  trade deficit in goods and services with China  which hit a record  379 billion last year  America s trade deficit with China has been a chronic complaint of Trump  although many economists say a bilateral trade gap is relatively insignificant Congressional Democrats and others have warned Trump against reaching any agreement that settles for more U S  exports to China without also requiring Beijing to adopt serious economic reforms  Stand firm  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y   said Tuesday   Skip the political photo op and make good on your promise to stand up for American businesses and workers when China takes advantage  Christopher Adams  a former China specialist at the Treasury Department and the Office of the U S  Trade Representative who is a senior adviser at the Covington   Burling law firm  added   There has to be something substantive on the structural issues  Otherwise  the criticism will be severe  Whatever negotiators agree to  analysts say  they are unlikely to end the long standing tensions between America s mostly open  capitalist economy and a Chinese economy in which the Communist Party and the central government command the dominant role Even with a deal  Adams said   a lot of the underlying issues will still be with us unresolved because they re rooted in fundamental differences between the US and Chinese systems

President Trump than he indicated  according to government officials and others familiar with the matter The investigators had already written multiple summaries of the nearly 400 page report  and

WASHINGTON   The  cooling saucer  of the United States Senate keeps going into the microwave For the third time in six years  the majority party in the Senate detonated the so called nuclear option on Wednesday to unilaterally change years old rules of the chamber with a simple majority vote  This time  to work through a backlog of President Trump s judicial and administration nominations  Republicans cut the time between ending debate and a final confirmation vote on executive branch nominees and district court judges from 30 hours to two The change was a provocative step that reignited a bitter partisan fight over presidential nominations that has raged for a decade and spanned presidencies from both parties  Democrats dwelled at length over the blockade that stopped Judge Merrick B  Garland from ascending to the Supreme Court in the final year of Barack Obama s presidency to angrily question how Republicans could complain about the handling of Mr  Trump s nominees  There s no other word but  hypocrisy    said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader The majority leader  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  justified his actions on the Garland nomination  saying Democrats would have done the same thing to a Republican Supreme Court nominee  And he said Democrats started the process in 2003  when they began routinely filibustering a Republican president s nominees Mr  McConnell s move on Wednesday was intended to break the Democratic blockade over dozens of judicial and sub cabinet nominations sent to the Senate by the Trump administration and to appease Mr  Trump  who has been badgering him to take such a step for months  We had hoped the Democrats would negotiate  but their base will roast them alive if they supported  a compromise deal unblocking Trump nominees  said Senator John Cornyn  Republican of Texas  who is a close ally of Mr  McConnell But the one party rule change   which followed maneuvers by Democrats in 2013 to end the 60 vote threshold for most judges and executive branch nominees  and by Republicans in 2017 to end the 60 vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees   knocked down another pillar of Senate custom that separated it from the majority rule House  And it took the chamber one step closer to ending the defining procedural bulwark of the Senate  the 60 vote requirement for moving ahead with most legislation  The Senate has changed so dramatically under McConnell s influence   said Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the second ranking Democrat in the upper chamber   He is corrupting the Senate into an institution that is more like the House of Lords than what the framers intended  We have walked away from amending  debating and legislating  Mr  Schumer declared it  a very sad day for the Senate  Mr  McConnell answered   This is not a sad day  this is a glad day   We know you don t like Donald Trump  but he won an election and he is entitled  to  set up  his government  he continued Under the new rules  the Senate approved the nomination of Jeffrey Kessler to be assistant secretary of commerce  It was then to approve Roy Kalman Altman to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Wednesday s rule change was not as sweeping as the 2013 move  made when Democrats controlled the chamber  to abolish the 60 vote threshold on most nominees  Nor was it as provocative as 2017  when the Republican majority extended that 51 vote confirmation threshold to the Supreme Court after Mr  McConnell spent most of 2016 blocking Judge Garland s nomination But Wednesday s precedent opens the way for Mr  McConnell to speed up the nominating process for sub cabinet level posts and Federal District Court judges  appointments that represent as many as 80 percent of administration nominees  Democrats say that by limiting the time between cutting off debate on a nominee and voting on final confirmation  the Senate loses time needed to vet nominees Senate Democrats   who have been marginalized by Mr  McConnell s hardball style of leadership   said Wednesday s move represented an attack on institutional norms put in place to ensure full debate For Mr  Trump  the change is long overdue  For more than a year the White House  spurred on by Mr  Trump and officials in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs  has prodded Mr  McConnell to invoke what has been referred to on Capitol Hill as a  mini  nuclear option But Mr  McConnell resisted  in part because of the opposition of two moderate Republicans  Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee Their opposition ebbed in recent weeks after sporadic talks overseen by Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer to unfreeze some of the nominations fell apart  Mr  Trump expressed his frustration over the logjam during his hourlong appearance at the Republicans  weekly lunch in the Capitol last week  This is crazy   he said  according to two people in the room   We have all these people  ambassadors  who have put their whole lives on hold  waiting to be confirmed A day later  Mr  McConnell  speaking at a second strategy lunch with his conference  blasted Mr  Schumer and claimed he was avoiding a compromise out of fear that he would be publicly attacked by liberals in his party He singled out Mr  Schumer s own former spokesman  Brian Fallon  who now leads a progressive coalition that lobbies against the appointment of conservative judges  Chuck won t make a deal because he s afraid of Brian Fallon   Mr  McConnell said  according to a person familiar with his remarks Mr  Fallon did not respond to a request for comment  The only thing stopping a deal is Senator Mitch McConnell  because Senator McConnell wants to change the rules   said Justin Goodman  Mr  Schumer s current spokesman Mr  Schumer has privately expressed frustration with his recent interactions with Mr  McConnell  particularly the majority leader s unwillingness to even consider a separate deal for nonjudicial appointments  In a recent leadership meeting  Mr  Schumer complained that Mr  McConnell was offering him a deal that  chopped off four fingers  as opposed to cutting off his whole hand  Senate Democratic aides said Every Senate Democrat voted against the rule change on Wednesday  Two Republican senators  Mike Lee of Utah and Ms  Collins  also opposed it  The Senate s rules protect the rights of the American people by balancing the competing interests of majorities  minorities and individual senators   Mr  Lee said The actual nominations were less controversial than the rule  and a handful of Democrats crossed the aisle to vote for Mr  Altman Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer  who bear no great affection for each other  engaged in an uncommonly emotional duel on the Senate floor   holding in rapt attention two dozen senators who  in near unison  deposited their iPhones on their desks or laps to watch At one point  Mr  Schumer  speaking from a prepared text  turned to confront Mr  McConnell directly  accusing the leader of abusing  the brute power of the majority  to push the change  I m sorry my Republican colleagues have gone along with Senator McConnell s debasement of the Senate   he said Mr  McConnell sat impassively at his desk a few feet away as Mr  Schumer spoke  He stared down at the carpet and fussed with his shirt cuffs  wearing a wry  mocking grin When he stood to defend himself  his face betrayed the strain  gradually reddening into a crimson blush that spanned from cheekbone to jaw  as he accused Democrats  under the leadership of  a fella named Chuck Schumer   for weaponizing the filibuster over the past 15 years  He started the whole thing   Mr  McConnell said  turning to face Mr  Schumer  

WASHINGTON   Amid blowback from Capitol Hill  President Donald Trump switched gears again Wednesday  suggesting he never wanted Congress to vote to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election Trump s new tweets shifted his rationale for the  Obamacare  fight  First he said it was his choice to push off the health care votes  Then he said he never expected there to be any votes at all until after 2020 Trump claimed Wednesday he had never intended to reopen old wounds  But in keeping the issue at the forefront  the president put fresh attention on the GOP s long running and thus far unsuccessful effort to end ACA  I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me   the Republican Party   Trump tweeted  adding   I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election  That s not how congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader McConnell  understood Trump s sudden shift to the issue last week Nor did it stop Democrats from calling attention to the health care issue Wednesday The Democratic controlled House used a near party line 240 186 vote to condemn the Trump administration for joining a federal lawsuit aimed at annulling former President Barack Obama s health care law  Minutes later  the House Democrats  campaign organization launched digital ads in the districts of around 40 Democrats in competitive seats  saying they d  fought back  against GOP efforts to gut the statute s protections The GOP s bitter internal fight over health care in 2017 remains a sore subject for the president  He often retells the story of the late Arizona Sen  John McCain s  no  vote that killed the repeal and replace effort  Republicans  hit hard on health care issues during the 2018 midterm election  had no plans to take up the issue again before the next one Trump s fight was on display when he told Republican senators last week that his White House was developing a plan to replace the Obama health law  The sudden move stunned GOP leaders on Capitol Hill  While Trump wanted them to become  the party of health care   they feared it could be for all the wrong reasons if they were forced into a do over of the tough votes McConnell on Tuesday issued a rare public disclosure of his private counsel to the president  warning that another health care fight would be politically costly and doomed to fail now that Democrats control the House  The usually tight lipped leader said afterward that the president agreed to shelve his health care push until after the campaign  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters Tuesday Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week   backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  mindful that Republican unfulfilled promises to  repeal and replace  the Obama era law stand as a glaring failure of his administration  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   Trump said Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  After Trump said last week he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  McConnell faced a revolt from the ranks McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking    Associated Press writers Zeke Miller  Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram  Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar  Darlene Superville and Kevin Freking contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   The U S  and China opened a ninth round of talks Wednesday  aiming to further narrow differences in an ongoing trade war that has deepened uncertainty for businesses and investors and cast a pall over the outlook for the global economy The latest negotiating session on American soil follows a similar set of talks held last week in Beijing Larry Kudlow  a top White House economic adviser  said  good headway  was made when U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met in the Chinese capital with a delegation headed by Vice Premier Liu He  a confidant of President Xi Jinping Kudlow expressed optimism that the parties would narrow the areas of disagreement further this week  They ll be here for three days  maybe more   he told reporters at a roundtable sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor Others said they ve been encouraged by the tone of the negotiations thus far Myron Brilliant  head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  estimated Tuesday that the two sides are 90  of the way to an agreement but cautioned that  the last 10  is the hardest part  the trickiest part  At the heart of the dispute are the Trump administration s allegations that China steals technology and coerces U S  companies to hand over trade secrets   all part of Beijing s zeal to overtake U S  technological dominance  To pressure China  the United States has imposed tariffs on  250 billion in Chinese goods  The Chinese have counterpunched by taxing  110 billion in U S  imports Forecasters at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  among others  have downgraded their outlook for the global economy  partly because the U S  China rift is damaging trade and causing businesses to slow investment until they know how the dispute will end Tensions have eased somewhat since President Donald Trump and Xi met in Buenos Aires late last year and the administration ended up suspending its plans to raise tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese imports to buy time for negotiations Kudlow said the talks are covering a host of issues that the two sides  have never really covered before  and that progress was being made on all fronts   which is the assessment administration officials from Trump on down have been making publicly for weeks  We re not there yet and we hope this week we get closer   Kudlow said Analysts say two major sticking points  in particular  stand in the way of any agreement First  Trump wants to preserve at least the 25  tariffs he has imposed on  50 billion in Chinese imports as a way to maintain leverage over Beijing  China wants them lifted Second  the two sides must develop a mechanism to ensure that China honors any commitments it makes in an agreement  The administration complains that China has repeatedly failed to keep promises it made in previous trade talks The Chinese are widely expected to agree to buy substantially more American products   likely including soybeans and natural gas   to help narrow the United States  trade deficit in goods and services with China  which hit a record  379 billion last year  America s trade deficit with China has been one of Trump s chronic complaints  although many economists say a bilateral trade gap is relatively insignificant Congressional Democrats and others have warned Trump against reaching any agreement that settles for more U S  exports to China without also requiring Beijing to adopt serious economic reforms  Stand firm   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y   said Tuesday   Skip the political photo op and make good on your promise to stand up for American businesses and workers when China takes advantage  Christopher Adams  a former China specialist at the Treasury Department and the Office of the U S  Trade Representative who is a senior adviser at the Covington   Burling law firm  added   There has to be something substantive on the structural issues  Otherwise  the criticism will be severe  Whatever negotiators agree to  analysts say  they are unlikely to end the long standing tensions between America s mostly open  capitalist economy and a Chinese economy in which the Communist Party and the central government command the dominant role Even with a deal  Adams said   a lot of the underlying issues will still be with us unresolved because they re rooted in fundamental differences between the U S  and Chinese systems     Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States and China were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks  while warning Beijing that it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without a pact The two countries are engaged in intense negotiations to end a months long trade war that has rattled global markets  but hopes of a resolution soared after both sides expressed optimism following talks in Beijing last week Speaking to reporters at the White House at the start of a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  Trump said some of the tougher points of a deal had been agreed but there were still differences to be bridged  We re getting very close to making a deal  That doesn t mean a deal is made  because it s not  but we re certainly getting a lot closer   Trump said in the Oval Office  And I would think with  oh  within the next four weeks or maybe less  maybe more  whatever it takes  something very monumental could be announced  Trump said he would hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping if there were a deal Xi assured Trump that text of the China U S  trade could be finalised soon  in a message conveyed by Liu He According to state run news agency Xinhua  Liu He told Trump that Xi believed under his and Trump s leadership  China U S  relations will make new and greater progress Xi said that in the past month or more  the two sides  trade teams had maintained close contact and  achieved new and substantive progress on issues in the text of two countries  trade agreement    I hope the two sides  trade teams can continue working in the spirit of mutual respect  equality  and mutual benefit to resolve each other s concerns  and finish negotiations on the text of the China U S  trade agreement soon   Xi said to Trump through Liu KEEPING LEVERAGE Trump declined to say what would happen to U S  tariffs on  250 billion worth of goods as part of a deal  China wants the tariffs lifted  while U S  officials are wary of giving up that leverage  at least for now  Asked about the benefits of an agreement for China  Trump said   It s going to be great for China  in that China will continue to trade with the United States  I mean  otherwise  it would be very tough for us to allow that to happen  Goods trade between the United States and China  the world s two largest economies  totaled  660 billion last year  according to U S  Census Bureau data  consisting of imports of  540 billion from China and  120 billion in exports to China On China s behalf  Liu cited  great progress  in the talks because of Trump s direct involvement and expressed hope that the talks would lead to  a good result  U S  SEEKS SWEEPING CHANGESTrump has previously threatened to impose punitive tariffs on all imports from China  more than a half trillion dollars worth of products  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  who is leading the talks for the Trump administration  said there were still some  major  major issues  to resolve and praised Liu s commitment to reform in China  Asked about the remaining sticking points  Trump mentioned tariffs and intellectual property theft  He said he would discuss tariffs with Liu in their meeting  Some of the toughest things have been agreed to   Trump said  He later said that an enforcement plan for a deal remained a sticking point as well   We have to make sure there s enforcement  I think we ll get that done  We ve discussed it at length   he said Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are holding talks in Washington with a Chinese delegation this week after meeting together in Beijing last week  The current round of talks is scheduled to go through Friday and possibly longer Hopes that the talks were moving in a positive direction have cheered financial markets in recent weeks  But U S  stocks were mixed on Thursday as investors waited for more developments in the trade negotiations  with the Dow Jones industrial Average slightly higher  and the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slightly lower    N The United States is seeking reforms to Chinese practices that it says result in the theft of U S  intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology from U S  companies to Chinese firms Administration officials initially envisioned a summit between Trump and Xi potentially taking place in March  but some U S  lawmakers and lobbying groups have said recently they were told that the administration was now aiming for a deal in late April OUTSTANDING ISSUESWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last week that the talks were  not time dependent  and could be extended for weeks or even months longer While some reform pledges by Beijing are largely set  including an agreement to avoid currency manipulation  an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China keeps its pledges and the status of U S  tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods must be resolved  China has been very clear  publicly and privately  that they would like to see all the tariffs removed   U S  Chamber of Commerce international affairs chief Myron Brilliant told reporters on Tuesday   The  Trump  administration has been equally clear that they want to keep some of the tariffs in place as a way to have leverage over China fulfilling its obligations under whatever final package is reached

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump eased up on his threats to close the southern border as officials across his administration explored half measures that might satisfy the president s urge for action  like stopping only foot traffic at certain crossings Facing a surge of Central American migrants trying to enter the U S   Trump last week threatened to seal the border this week if Mexico did not immediately halt all illegal immigration into the U S   a move that would have enormous economic consequences on both sides of the border While Trump on Tuesday did not back off the idea completely  he said he was pleased with steps Mexico had taken in recent days and renewed his calls for Congress to make changes he contends would solve the problem  Let s see if they keep it done   he said of Mexico   Now  if they don t  or if we don t make a deal with Congress  the border s going to be closed  100    He also said that he might only close  large sections of the border  and  not all of it   He added that his posturing was  the only way we re getting a response  Later Tuesday  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen held an emergency call with Cabinet members and White House aides  saying   We are going to treat it as if we have been hit by a Category 5 hurricane   according to a person on the call  The person was not authorized to discuss the call publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Nielsen was creating an emergency operations center and named U S  Border Patrol official Manny Padilla as an operational crisis coordinator to manage the response from within the different immigration agencies at the Department of Homeland Security  Padilla is a 30 year Border Patrol veteran and was recently the head of the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas His job will be different from that of the immigration or  border czar  that Trump is considering  the official said Closing the border completely would disrupt manufacturing supply lines and the flow of goods ranging from avocados to cars  making for a  potentially catastrophic economic impact   in the words of Republican Sen  Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader Some inside the administration also worry it would only exacerbate illegal immigration Meantime  administration officials grappled with how they might minimize the impact of a shutdown or implement less sweeping actions White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow  for example  told CNBC he s been looking at potentially keeping truck lanes open  We are looking at different options  particularly if you can keep those freight lanes  the truck lanes  open   he said  As for the hundreds of thousands of tourists and workers who cross the border legally  Kudlow said   that may be difficult  Earlier  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had told reporters that  while   Eventually  it may be that it s the best decision that we close the border   the president was  not working on a specific timeline  and all options remained on the table  The Council of Economic Advisers  she said  was conducting a number of studies on the impact  and  working with the president to give him those options  White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in an appearance on MSNBC that closing only certain entry ports  or parts of all of them  could be among the steps short of closing the entire border It was a shift from Trump s threat late last week to seal the whole border  and quickly   I am not kidding around   he said then  exasperated by the swelling numbers of migrants  thousands of whom were being released into the U S  because border officials had no space for them  Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100 000 arrests or denials of entry in March  a 12 year high  More than half of those are families with children  who require extra care With southern border facilities near a breaking point  U S  officials are busing many migrants hundreds of miles inland and dropping them off at bus stations and churches  Trump has mocked and vowed to end that  catch and release  practice but overwhelmed authorities saw no choice Responding to Trump s threats  Nielsen rushed home late Monday night from Europe  where she was attending G7 security meetings and intended to fly to the border mid week to assess the impact of changes already made  including reassigning some 2 000 border officers assigned to check vehicles to deal with migrant crowds and new efforts to return more asylum seekers to Mexico as they wait out their case Officials were hoping to have as many as 300 asylum seekers returned to Mexico per day by the end of the week near Calexico and El Paso in Texas and San Ysidro in California  Right now  only 60 a day are returned Nielsen has also requested volunteers from non immigration agencies within her department and sent a letter to Congress seeking more money and detention space and broader authority to deport families faster  The request was met with disdain by Democrats Even absent the extraordinary step of sealing a national border  delays at border stations have been mounting due to the personnel reassignments  Homeland Security officials said  When the Otay Mesa  California  entry port closed for the night Monday  150 trucks were still waiting to get into the U S Shutting certain border stations or parts of them would not be unprecedented  Over the Thanksgiving holiday last year  Trump claimed he d already  closed the border  after officials briefly closed the northbound lanes at San Ysidro  California  for several hours in the early morning to bolster security because of concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members Mexican officials announced Monday they d pulled 338 Central American migrants  181 adults and 157 children  off five passenger buses in a southern state that borders Guatemala  and said they had detained 15 possible smugglers on immigration law violations  But that was not unusual for Mexico  which has for years been cracking down on migration In 2014 then President Enrique Pena Nieto launched a program that was

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s Senate GOP allies  frustrated by delays in confirming dozens of lower profile nominees  rammed through a rules change Wednesday that cuts back debate on most of his picks The GOP plan  approved 51 48  indefinitely restored rules in place during the first few years of President Barack Obama s second term  Those rules had lapsed  allowing any senator to force 30 hours of debate on a nominee The rules change limits debate on most nominees to two hours instead of 30  White House selections for the Cabinet  Supreme Court and appeals courts would be exempted from the new rules  Every Democrat opposed the maneuver  joined by two Republicans  Susan Collins of Maine and Mike Lee of Utah The Senate changed the rules after a partisan debate that featured unusually personal finger pointing between the chamber s party leaders  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   and Minority leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y  They have battled over judicial filibusters since the administration of President George W  Bush McConnell  no stranger to obstructionist tactics himself  said the situation had gotten out of hand  with the Senate taking 128 votes to end debate on Trump s nominees during his first two years in office  far more than under other presidents  The comprehensive campaign by Senate Democrats to delay Senate consideration of presidential nominations is now more than two years old   McConnell said   It s time for this sorry chapter to end  Pointing at Schumer repeatedly during a tartly worded speech  McConnell said the battles on presidential nominees date back to Schumer led filibusters of Bush appeals court picks such as Miguel Estrada  whose nomination stalled after a lobbying campaign by liberal judicial activists  He started this whole thing that we ve been wrestling with since 2003  cooked it up  convinced his colleagues to do it   McConnell said Schumer said McConnell was Machiavellian  cynical and hypocritical  and used his speech to recount a series of GOP power plays  This is a very sad day for the Senate  At a time when Leader McConnell brags about confirming more judges than anyone has done in a very long time  he feels the need to invoke the terribly destructive and disproportionate procedure of the  nuclear option  in order to fast track even more of President Trump s ultra conservative nominees to the federal bench   Schumer said Schumer  however  supported this step in a 2013 vote orchestrated by then Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   that eliminated the filibuster on Cabinet nominees and most judicial appointees  The maneuver allows the majority to change the rules on a party line vote Republicans said at the time that Reid and Democrats would come to regret the change  which has given Trump largely free rein to fill numerous judicial vacancies that have piled up over the years  I share some of the responsibility for where we find ourselves today   said Sen  Michael Bennet  D Colo  He said McConnell  said at the time that  you re going to come to regret this decision   and I will say this about him  he was right  I do  Many Democrats  who benefited from prior rules changes under Obama  now say the GOP move will enable Trump and future presidents  so long as their party controls the Senate  to run roughshod over the Senate They say the hurdles required to win confirmation should be difficult as a way to ensure nominees are ethical  qualified and responsive to requests by senators for information  There is no emergency that justifies changing the Senate rules  Sen  McConnell himself admitted the Senate has plenty of time to consider nominees   said Sen  Dick Durbin  D Ill   This is all about avoiding close scrutiny for extreme ideological nominees that Republicans want to pack onto the federal courts for lifetime appointments  But other Democrats  McConnell said  indicated behind the scenes that they could support the rules change provided that it wouldn t take effect until the next administration Democrats also say that GOP complaints over their tactics now ring hollow after the obstructionism Obama experienced over his two terms Merrick Garland  a federal appeals court judge nominated to the Supreme Court by Obama  failed to get a Senate hearing  and Republicans stalled numerous other Obama judicial nominees   both when the GOP was in the minority and then after retaking the Senate in 2015 Armed with the White House and control of the Senate  Trump is now confirming both district and appeals court judges at a dizzying pace and is positioned to reshape the federal judiciary even if he fails to win a second term  

WASHINGTON   Democrats mocked President Donald Trump on Tuesday for pushing back his promise of sweeping healthcare reform until after the 2020 election  and said they were happy to make it a central campaign issue Trump had pledged in recent days to use court action to end Obamacare  the signature law of his Democratic predecessor  Barack Obama  and said his Republican Party would push over the next few months for a better healthcare plan at lower cost for most Americans But Republican leaders in Congress quickly shied away from the issue and pushed him to reconsider In a series of late night tweets on Monday  Trump did just that  saying there would be no vote on any healthcare legislation until after next year s election Democrats gleefully jumped on the delay  saying it showed Trump and his party had no idea what to do with healthcare beyond repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021  Translation  they have no healthcare plan   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said   They are for repeal  they have no replace  Mitch McConnell  the Republican Senate majority leader  said he told Trump on Monday the party was not about to restart work on comprehensive healthcare legislation  noting Republicans were unable to pass a plan when they controlled both chambers of Congress in the first two years of the Trump presidency  I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters  Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in November elections after campaigning heavily on strengthening Obamacare FIRST VOTETrump said on Tuesday he and Republicans would draw up a new healthcare plan ahead of the 2020 election and implement it soon afterward  I think we re going to have a great healthcare package     If we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency   which I hope are two good assumptions   we re going to have a phenomenal healthcare   Trump told reporters He said a Republican plan would mean most Americans pay lower premiums and deductibles for their healthcare than they currently pay under Obamacare  revisiting a promise he made during the 2016 campaign Trump told House Republicans in a speech on Tuesday night that they should campaign on a pledge to make healthcare the first vote in Congress after the 2020 election He said one of the major reasons Democrats won control of the House last year was because Republicans did not have a healthcare plan to put forward to voters  Republicans should not run away from healthcare  You can t do it  You re going to get clobbered   Trump said While Trump s delay gives Republicans more time to knit together an alternative to Obamacare  it all but guarantees a 2020 battle over the divisive issue  Don t let President Trump fool you  America  Republicans are not the party of healthcare  They are the party that wants to end your healthcare   Schumer said at a rally on Tuesday   We Democrats will not stop fighting tooth and nail to protect America s healthcare  today  tomorrow  and on in through 2021  Trump and his fellow Republicans vowed in the 2016 presidential election to  repeal and replace  Obamacare but failed to do so during their first two years in power  despite control of both the Senate and the House  Several of the leading candidates for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination  including a number of current U S  senators  have already made healthcare a major part of their campaign message Trump accuses Democrats of seeking  a socialist takeover of American healthcare   and is certain to take that argument onto the 2020 campaign trail   I see what the Democrats are doing  It s a disaster what they re planning and everyone knows it   he told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday   Reporting by Susan Heavey and Susan Cornwell  dditional reporting by Roberta Rampton  Editing by Susan Thomas  Bill Berkrot and Peter Cooney

WASHINGTON   U S  congressional Democrats on Wednesday authorized a powerful committee chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 election  moving closer to a legal clash with President Donald Trump s administration The Democratic led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to enable its chairman  Jerrold Nadler  to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller s unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides including political strategist Steve Bannon Nadler has not yet exercised that authority  with the timing of any such move uncertain  The committee vote was 24 17 along party lines  with Democrats in favor and Trump s fellow Republicans opposed Attorney General William Barr  a Trump appointee  issued a four page summary of Mueller s main conclusions last month including that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400 page report by mid April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence gathering sources and methods In addition to Bannon  the committee authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn  former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson They are among 81 people  agencies and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates Nadler s panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would ignore a Democratic demand turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline  Democrats have expressed concern Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign Nadler said he would work with Barr  for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials  and will go to court to get permission to obtain the grand jury material  But if that doesn t work out in a very short order  we will issue the subpoenas   Nadler added       The committee must see everything   The potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government s third branch   the judiciary Representative Doug Collins  the committee s top Republican  said Democrats are  desperate for dirt on this president   This is reckless  It s irresponsible  And it s disingenuous   Collins said   It s also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing  making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy  It was not clear how likely the Justice Department would be to hand over subpoenaed documents  It could ignore a subpoena  running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress  and prepare for a potentially lengthy court battle INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACTIONIn another development  the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic led House Intelligence Committee  led by Trump critic Adam Schiff  is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump s inaugural committee Citing people familiar with the request  the Journal reported that the effort signaled that Congress is expanding its probe of how the inaugural committee raised and spent more than  100 million  The report could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters Barr s March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice  Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller s inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump  Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice  Moscow denied election interference  Mueller and U S  intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U S  Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report  If the department still refuses  then it should be up to a judge   not the president or his political appointee   to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record   Nadler said  Trump ally Lindsey Graham  Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  wrote on Twitter that the House panel s demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was  dangerous and ridiculous  The Justice Department declined comment  Priebus declined to comment  A lawyer for Priebus  Bannon and McGahn  as well as a Bannon spokeswoman  did not immediately respond to requests for comment Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries  Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge s permission to get access to Mueller s grand jury material  which is protected under federal law  Nadler said Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far  Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well  noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report s release to Congress   Reporting by David Morgan  Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld  Sarah N  Lynch  Steve Holland and Mark Hosenball  Editing by

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Monday he was willing to wait until after the 2020 presidential election to get Congress to vote on a new healthcare plan  giving Republicans time to develop a proposal to replace Obamacare Congressional Republicans have been unable thus far to draft a proposal to replace Democratic President Barack Obama s signature Affordable Care Act despite frequent vows to do so in recent years Trump s vow last week that the Republican Party will be  the party of healthcare  caught his fellow Republicans off guard after the Justice Department backed a lawsuit intended to wipe out Obamacare  which has helped millions of Americans get health insurance In a series of tweets on Monday night  Trump said Republicans are developing  a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums  cost    deductibles than Obamacare   In other words it will be far less expensive   much more usable than ObamaCare  Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House   he said Trump s move suggests he is willing to debate the future of the U S  healthcare system during the 2020 presidential election campaign than try to reach agreement on a plan sooner   Reporting By Steve Holland  editing by Darren Schuettler  

WASHINGTON   The arrest of a Chinese woman who carried a malware laced device into Mar a Lago  President Trump s Florida resort  has exposed porous security at the private club and escalating tensions between Secret Service agents and the resort s staff members  who vet guest lists and allow people onto the sprawling grounds At times neither side has had full clarity on who was entering Mar a Lago  Secret Service agents must rely on club receptionists and other employees to crosscheck visitors  former officials said Communication breakdowns allow for security breaches   like the one on Saturday  when the woman  Yujing Zhang  32  was arrested with four cellphones  a hard drive  a laptop and a malware infected thumb drive  She said she was there to attend a  United Nations Friendship Event  that had never been scheduled Her arrest revealed gaps in Mr  Trump s security as well as the challenge of protecting a president who spends less time at the remote  fortified Camp David and more time at his busy resort with sometimes hundreds of guests  The normally tight lipped Secret Service was so disturbed by the breach that it issued an unusual statement that effectively blamed the Mar a Lago staff for not tightly tracking the comings and goings of guests  The Secret Service does not determine who is invited or welcome at Mar a Lago  this is the responsibility of the host entity   the agency said in a statement late Tuesday   The Mar a Lago club management determines which members and guests are granted access to the property  The arrest of Ms  Zhang came against a backdrop of increasing interest in Mar a Lago in China  where advertisements on the internet and on social media sell invitations to the club  which also functions as a for profit enterprise that rents itself out  The advertisements promise the prospect of rubbing elbows with the president and his associates at banquets  fund raisers and other events  Access to Mar a Lago is highly prized in China  bestowing respect  influence and the allure of potential business opportunities After Ms  Zhang was stopped  she produced a copy of a Chinese language invitation for the friendship event that was promoted by Cindy Yang  who had previously owned a string of massage parlors where the police shut down a prostitution ring in February  The authorities said the patrons included Robert K  Kraft  a friend of the president s and the owner of the New England Patriots Ms  Yang  who is active in groups backed by the Chinese government and Communist Party  is no stranger to Mar a Lago herself  Last year  she attended a Trump fund raiser at the resort and posed for a photo with the president Federal officials said they were still investigating Ms  Zhang and what kind of malware was on her thumb drive  It was not yet clear whether she was just a striver seeking selfies at the president s resort or whether she had links to Chinese intelligence  Ms  Zhang s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment Hotels owned by the Trump Organization have come under cyberattack before  in 2015  credit card information was stolen from a number of Trump hotel properties  But that appeared to be criminal action  rather than the act of a state Some of the Chinese promoters of these events flaunt their connections to China s ruling Communist Party and the department that promotes its foreign policy abroad  the United Front Work Department When the president is in Palm Beach  as he was on Saturday  agents must construct a government security system on top of what is essentially a private residence  Questions about the process arose about a month after Mr  Trump assumed office in 2017  when resort guests took plain sight photos of Mr  Trump and the Japanese prime minister discussing a North Korean missile launch  Several Democratic lawmakers called for an investigation into how the club was vetting its visitors  The Secret Service relies on the club s security  who has the guest list to tell them who belongs and who doesn t   said Don Mihalek  executive vice president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association  which represents the Secret Service  The Secret Service is not in the club membership business and does not have visibility on who these members are or what they re entitled to   said Mr  Mihalek  a former Secret Service agent who was assigned to Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign and presidential details from 2007 to 2011   That s the standard for any protected site outside of the White House  On Wednesday  Mr  Trump praised the Secret Service and his staff at Mar a Lago for helping to catch the woman   The person at the front desk did a very good job  to be honest with you   he said ImageThe president s frequent visits to Mar a Lago make the resort a visible target for supporters  protesters and  officials fear  others who might try to breach security layers meant to protect Mr  Trump CreditT J  Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesA former employee who worked at Mar a Lago from 2016 to 2018 said that the arrest of Ms  Zhang was not surprising  people have been caught on the property previously  In one notable example  a woman gained access to the Mar a Lago computer system and changed the automatic screen saver to the name of the president  preceded by an expletive  according to the employee  who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of legal retribution The former employee said security at the estate was not particularly strong  particularly when Mr  Trump was not there   a fact that was well known among the staff Joe Kirschbaum  who helped write a Government Accountability Office report on Mar a Lago security  said congressional inspectors received little help from the White House or the Trump Organization  He warned that it was not the responsibility of the Mar a Lago staff to keep Mr  Trump safe  and that the limited amount of information allowed to the Secret Service could create future problems In a letter on Wednesday  several Democratic senators asked Christopher A  Wray  the F B I  director  to assess the security conditions at Mar a Lago  The latest incident raises very serious questions regarding security vulnerabilities at Mar a Lago  which foreign intelligence services have reportedly targeted   wrote Senators Chuck Schumer of New York  Dianne Feinstein of California and Mark Warner of Virginia The president has personally instructed members to pack fund raisers beyond the ticket limit at Mar a Lago  according to one event organizer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations with Mr  Trump The fund raisers  which occur most weekends during the height of the winter season   usually held in hopes that the president or his family members may drop in   are staged in a large ballroom adjacent to the main patio where Mr  Trump eats his dinner Mr  Trump encouraged one organizer to pack the ballroom for a February event beyond the 700 person limit  advising that person to tell his staff at Mar a Lago that he said he would allow the increase  That organizer was told that the Mar a Lago security team had no final say over crowd numbers  but the event still grew to around 730 guests In the end  Mr  Trump did not attend  and it was screened by Mar a Lago officials and a private security company hired by the event s organizers When the president is not at his club  the security bubble becomes easier to break Members and guests must still present identification and check in with the club s security team  but several layers of Secret Service protection are not in place  Laurence Leamer  a Palm Beach resident who wrote a book about Mar a Lago  said in an interview that the scene could be freewheeling   like having dinner at the Outback Steakhouse   adding that the security  seems to me to be incredibly lax  Mr  Trump was at his nearby golf club four miles away when Ms  Zhang showed up at the resort on Saturday  and the process that the Secret Service uses to check visitors when he is in town was in place  officials said  Ms  Zhang was screened by agents before reaching the club s reception area  but confusion over her name and a potential communication barrier led to her entering On Wednesday  the Secret Service was reviewing the Saturday incident with security at Mar a Lago  John Cohen  a former acting under secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who worked closely with the Secret Service on protection details  said the president s  predictable  travel to the resort had made the location vulnerable  That s a nightmare for the Secret Service   he said   A privately owned ranch where the president and his people use the location is much easier than protecting the president when he chooses to go to a private club that s open to members that provides services to those people in exchange for a fee  When people approach a checkpoint at Mar a Lago  the Secret Service is focused on screening them for weapons or explosives  Mr  Mihalek said The agents will also screen for people they label  gate callers   those who have exhibited suspicious behavior   such as waiting for the president at the gate of the White House  From there  an agent will rely on security guards or staff members at the location to verify whether someone is a member or a guest of the club  If I m an intelligence service I m going to pay the membership fee  get someone with a clean background and have them become a member of the community   Mr  Cohen said   I m going to have them bring in guests on a regular basis  and that s going to be my strategy  I now have close proximity to the president s staff and maybe even the president himself

WASHINGTON   As Mississippi s governor toured massive flooding in the state  the Trump administration said Wednesday that it is giving another look to a long dead flood control and drainage project in the Mississippi Delta that had been killed by the George W  Bush administration because of its potential impact on wetlands and wildlife The project  which the late Sen  John McCain once called  one of the worst projects ever conceived by Congress   had called for huge pumps to be built at the confluence of the Yazoo and Mississippi Rivers in Mississippi  It was rejected by the Bush administration in 2008  Had that veto not occurred  we believe that the flooding  particularly in the Yazoo backwater  would have been much less damaging   said Mississippi Gov  Phil Bryant  after touring the region by helicopter Opponents say the pumps could worsen flooding downstream After touring the flooded region  Bryant told journalists that he had spent Monday and Tuesday in Washington  lobbying the administration to override the 2008 EPAs decision to kill the project  On Wednesday  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler confirmed to a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing that his agency is now reconsidering that 2008 decision Communities along the lower Mississippi River have been dealing with flooding for nearly two months  More than 500 000 acres  200 000 hectares  are submerged in the region  including more than 200 000 acres  80 000 hectares  of farmland  Farmers say flooding is harming them financially The U S  Army Corps of Engineers and local agencies are deploying a complex system of levees  dams  floodgates and floodways to try to contain high water and limit damage along the more than 2 000 mile river Floodwaters  have placed a tremendous burden on the lives and property of thousands of Mississippians   Sen  Cindy Hyde Smith  a Mississippi Republican  told Wheeler at Wednesday s hearing Bryant  who has aligned himself tightly with President Donald Trump  said Wednesday that more than 1 100 homes are affected  although some of those are not flooded  but in areas with roads cut off by flooding  Water is so common in the region that some people build small levees around their houses Environmentalists say the pumps would be capable of draining more than 200 000 acres  80 000 hectares  of wetlands   an area larger than all five boroughs of New York City The soggy and frequently flooded lowlands have comparatively few houses but are vital to waterfowl and other wildlife  environmental groups say  The National Wildlife Federation said the pumps would serve primarily  so large landowners can increase agricultural production on marginal lands that have always flooded  Bob Irvin  president of the American Rivers conservation group  said in an email Wednesday that the EPA was moving to revive a  zombie  project  Nothing has changed since the first Bush administration recognized that the Yazoo Pumps project was an environmental disaster and an economic loser   Irvin said The Bush administration had invoked the Clean Water Act  saying it would cause  unacceptable damage  to valuable resources  At the time  it was one of only about a dozen times the federal water law had been invoked to reject a project outright The pump project has been heavily pushed by the Delta Council  a farming and business lobbying group that includes many large farmers in the fertile Mississippi Delta  Before retiring from the Senate  Thad Cochran  long a proponent of the project  made a final attempt last year to put language in a spending bill ordering pump construction to begin despite the EPA veto  it failed Sharkey County Supervisor Bill Newsom  who also manages a cotton gin  is one of many proponents of the pumps  He says farming is the only industry in the region  and says he doesn t want to drain the region s wetlands  just control flooding  We re just simply wanting to have a flood level we can live in   Newsom said last month    Amy reported from Jackson  Mississippi  Associated Press writer Rogelio Solis in Flowood  Mississippi contributed to this report

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  In recent days  President Trump has used Twitter to warn Mexico that he may close the border  to suggest that The New York Times and The Washington Post be stripped of their Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the special counsel s Russia investigation and to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates in 2018 And if Mr  Trump had his way  Brandon Neely  among others  would be blocked from seeing any of those tweets Mr  Neely  a police officer in Houston  is one of an untold number of Twitter users who have been blocked by Mr  Trump  These users  if they are logged into their accounts  cannot see the president s tweets and are unable to reply to them or see others  responses The president s actions led Mr  Neely  along with six others blocked by Mr  Trump  to sue him  saying he had violated their First Amendment rights  A federal judge in Manhattan ruled against Mr  Trump last year  finding that the president s Twitter feed was a  public forum  and  that his blockings were unconstitutional Mr  Trump appealed the ruling  and the case went before a three judge panel in Manhattan last week  The judges seemed skeptical of Mr  Trump s contention that he was acting in a personal  not official  capacity when he blocked people Circuit Judge Barrington D  Parker asked Mr  Trump s counsel  a Justice Department lawyer  why blocking  points of view the president doesn t like  isn t  just a quintessential First Amendment violation  How the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rules in the Trump case may have larger implications  as elected officials around the country expand the use of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter  Federal judges are grappling with the question of how the First Amendment may apply to those accounts Blocking on social media is not a partisan phenomenon  In 2017  for instance  ProPublica sent letters asking all 50 governors and 22 federal agencies whether they had blocked people on social media  Five Republican governors  four Democrats and four agencies responded with information about people they had blocked  Many agencies and more than half the governors did not respond In New York  the issue has arisen with Representative Peter King  a blunt and occasionally combative 14 term Republican congressman who represents parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island  Recently  one of his constituents collected the names of about 70 people who said they had been blocked from commenting on Mr  King s Facebook page  He s like this big tough guy  but he doesn t want to hear any criticism whatsoever   said the constituent  Jacqueline Hassett  who has been blocked and has met with lawyers about the possibility of suing Mr  King The seven Twitter users who sued Mr  Trump have been unblocked  following the lower court ruling   Anybody blocked by the president can still  in theory  view Mr  Trump s tweets  In an entry on its F A Q  page  Twitter tells users   If the account you ve blocked isn t logged in or is accessing Twitter content via a third party  they may be able to see your public

supervisors had violated the First Amendment rights of a constituent by blocking him on Facebook for about 12 hours Elsewhere  a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that three state assemblymen violated the First Amendment when they blocked a liberal advocacy group on Twitter  Jerry Brown  the former Democratic governor of California  produced records in 2017 showing that he had in the past blocked more than 1 500 people on Facebook and Twitter  and Paul Gosar  a Republican congressman of Arizona who in 2017 wrote a post on Facebook titled   So you re upset I blocked you on Facebook  Here s why I don t care  a three part series   said last year in a court filing that he was no longer blocking anyone Jameel Jaffer  the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University  which filed the Trump case and argued the Loudoun County appeal  said that social media accounts may be seen as public forums if they are used to make announcements related to government

main means of communicating with their constituents   Mr  Jaffer said   We want to make sure those officials aren t insulated from criticism  make sure participants in those digital spaces aren t deprived of the opportunity of hearing other citizens  divergent views and make sure these spaces retain their vitality and integrity and aren t transformed into echo chambers  In many ways  Mr  King s Facebook page reflects his public persona  It includes pictures of him in a Long Island diner with retired firefighters  a video of him at a St  Patrick s Day parade and a description of a meeting with an Israeli diplomatic official The page also includes announcements that he was backing legislation to fund the Sept  11 Victim Compensation Fund  co sponsoring a tax deduction bill and introducing a resolution calling for the extradition of people in Cuba who have been charged with crimes in the United States Mr  King said during a telephone interview that he has the right to block who he wants on his Facebook page because it does not use government resources  he also contends that it is separate from his congressional work  He said that his campaign committee pays to boost his posts  which are meant to function like re election ads  I wouldn t have to give any opponent an opportunity to comment on my campaign brochure   Mr  King said  adding that he only blocks some of his critics  usually those who make inappropriate remarks or comment frequently Mr  King has interacted with commenters  thanked supporters and sparred with critics  When a constituent from West Sayville  Chris Ann Rogers Pellegrino  asked on Facebook in 2017 for a  special outside investigation into Trump Russia ties   and told Mr  King she hoped he was loyal to  the fabric of our democracy  his reply was   My loyalty is to the Constitution  not the liberal zeitgeist  Ms  Rogers Pellegrino said she was blocked almost immediately after posting her message  Another constituent  Danielle Miller  said she was blocked last year after disagreeing with a post by Mr  King that said kneeling protests by professional football players were  rooted in the false narrative of police bias against black men  Several constituents who had been blocked said they were concerned that limiting criticism would create a misleading impression that Mr  King s positions are more reflective of his district than they actually are Christine DiBiase Martorana  from Seaford  said she was blocked after posting she was disappointed in Mr  King s  continued emphasis on Islamic terrorism  and asking for his thoughts  on non Muslim terrorists   Meg Rowe  from Brightwaters  said she was blocked after stating that she was keeping track of how many people Mr  King was blocking  It s infuriating  honestly   said Ms  Rowe  who in 2017 began a Facebook page called  Blocked by Peter King  to document blockings and the removal of posts   We just want some avenue to talk with him  even if we disagree  because it s his job to listen to us   

WASHINGTON   Democrats in the House of Representatives are gearing up to issue subpoenas to try to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election and President Donald Trump s actions related to the inquiry The question is  how successful will they be Attorney General William Barr  who has broad authority under Justice Department regulations to decide how much of Mueller s report to release  sent lawmakers a four page letter on March 24 explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  and has promised to release the nearly 400 page report by the middle of this month  with some parts blacked out  or  redacted  That has not satisfied Democrats  who control the House  The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over the complete report  without redactions  as well as underlying evidence Here is an explanation of the legal hurdles Democrats must clear in their subpoena effort  important judicial precedents and Barr s rationale for keeping parts of the report confidential CAN CONGRESS SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH Yes  Committees of the House and Senate possess the power to issues subpoenas for documents held by the executive branch or other subjects in investigations  Under the U S  Constitution  Congress is a co equal branch of the federal government alongside the executive branch and judiciary If Barr refuses to comply with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to obtain the full report and underlying investigative material  the House could vote to hold him  in contempt  and turn to the courts to enforce the subpoena  Legal experts said that process could take years  Barr s  principal conclusions  letter said Mueller s inquiry did not establish that Trump s campaign team conspired with Russia  Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the Republican president committed obstruction of justice but also did not exonerate him  Barr subsequently concluded that Trump had not engaged in criminal obstruction The letter provided scant details of the findings  though Trump immediately claimed  complete and total exoneration   The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over Trump s presidency  House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into Trump  who is seeking re election in 2020 A situation analogous to the current subpoena fight unfolded during the presidency of Trump s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama  In 2012  the House  then controlled by Republicans  subpoenaed internal Justice Department documents related to a failed federal law enforcement operation to track illegal gun sales  dubbed  Fast and Furious   Obama s attorney general  Eric Holder  refused to comply  The House voted to hold him in contempt  marking the first time in U S  history that Congress took such action against a sitting member of a president s Cabinet The Justice Department later turned over thousands of pages of documents but the matter was not resolved until after Obama left office  with a settlement reached in 2018 WHY DID BARR NOT SIMPLY RELEASE THE WHOLE REPORT Barr told lawmakers in a March 29 letter that he was making  redactions that are required  before releasing the Mueller report  He cited four reasons for redactions  protecting secret grand jury proceedings  safeguarding intelligence gathering sources and methods  shielding material that could affect ongoing investigations  and protecting information that would unduly infringe on personal privacy and reputations Grand juries are groups of citizens who meet in secret and decide whether to authorize criminal indictments or demands for evidence sought by prosecutors  U S  law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret  though there are exceptions that let Congress  and even the general public  see it Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege  which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government WHAT LAWS AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS APPLY Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight Under U S  law  grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret  But if a grand jury matter involves  grave hostile acts of a foreign power  or other intelligence information  the information can be shared with appropriate government officials  The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr  Leon Jaworski  a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal  produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings H R  Haldeman  who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff  sought to block that information from Congress  citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr  The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington  which ruled 5 1 against Haldeman  The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation  and noted that the Democratic led House Judiciary committee had taken  elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials   The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office  Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment  If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material  a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play  Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski  citing executive privilege  The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court  saying the president s interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary s need for evidence   Reporting by Jan Wolfe  Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder  

WASHINGTON   White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Wednesday said the Trump administration would soon issue an executive order that would open the door for more natural gas pipelines and exports of liquefied natural gas  or LNG  The administration  which is pushing a policy it calls energy dominance  has been considering an order that would push back against states  including New York  that have blocked interstate natural gas pipelines  Kudlow said the executive order would open the way for pipelines and LNG at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor news outlet  New York has blocked pipelines that would take natural gas from Pennsylvania to New England  which means the region sometimes needs imports of LNG  Early last year  a tanker carrying LNG from a project in Russia s Arctic arrived in Boston Harbor to satisfy demand during a cold snap  It was unclear how the order would overrule the authority of states to rule on pipelines Several politicians in New York  including Governor Andrew Cuomo  have said they want energy companies to focus more on renewable power sources and energy efficiency  instead of building more gas and other fossil fuel fired power plants and infrastructure New York State in recent years blocked the construction of several pipelines that would transport fracked natural gas from the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania to New England  including Williams Cos Inc s Constitution and Northeast Supply Enhancement and National Fuel Gas Co s  NFG  Northern Access  In those cases  New York regulators denied the pipelines on environmental grounds  Trump has attempted to use an executive order to jumpstart TransCanada Inc s long delayed Keystone XL crude oil pipeline  signing an order just two days after assuming office in 2017  But that did not save the pipeline from getting bogged down in the courts and last week he issued another order seeking to breathe life into the project Meanwhile an independent federal agency has taken some steps that could help gas pipelines in New York The U S  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  determined last year that New York regulators waived their right to decide on a water quality certification for NFG s Northern Access project because the state waited too long  FERC this week denied New York s request to rehear that decision  Williams has made a similar argument about the Constitution pipeline    Reporting by Jeff Mason and Timothy Gardner  additional reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York  editing by Franklin Paul  Jonathan Oatis and Susan Thomas  

MEXICO CITY   U S  President Donald Trump s threats to shut the border with Mexico are now affecting what some might argue is the softest spot in bilateral relations   avocados Fearing that a border lockdown would prevent Mexico from shipping the 80 percent of avocados that the United States consumes  processors and wholesalers have started stockpiling the prized fruit used in guacamole or as spread on toast Avocado prices have jumped nearly 50 percent over the last week alone as a consequence Stefan Oliva  a research analyst at Gro Intelligence  which collects and analyzes agricultural data  said  procurement managers  wholesalers and processors  are  clamoring  for avocados in case the border is shut ahead of the Cinco de Mayo celebration Cinco de Mayo commemorates the 1862 Battle of Puebla in which Mexican troops defeated invading French forces and is celebrated all over the United States  but in Mexico the day is mainly celebrated in Puebla The United States imported nearly  2 1 billion worth in avocados from Mexico in 2018  or more than 900 000 tonnes  he said That is some 10 times the value of avocados it buys from the rest of the world and more than 10 times what the United States currently produces  Gro Intelligence data shows   Even those very  very vague threats are enough to scare wholesalers and processors that are relying on consumers   Oliva said   If there is a border shutdown  they will have to circumvent the border and pay an extreme premium  Trump has taken a step back from his threat to close the border to fight illegal immigration  as pressure mounted from companies worried that a shutdown would cause chaos to supply chains  It could disrupt millions of legal crossings and billions of dollars in trade   nL1N21K0Q8 David Magana  a senior analyst specializing in food and agribusiness at Rabobank  said he had observed a 44 percent jump in the price of avocados over the past week  and that it could go higher still  If the border closes  this would be unchartered territory   Magana said   The prices could rise considerably  Alejandro Saldana  chief economist at Ve Por Ms  a Mexican bank that specializes in lending to the agricultural sector  said that a border shutdown could impact other produce  We could see a real impact on the industrial integration there is between Mexico and the U S    Saldana said   There will possibly be disruptions in manufacturing  particularly because a lot of the goods cross the border    Reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher in Mexico City  additional reporting by Julie Ingwersen in Chicago  Editing by Anthony Esposito and Michael Perry  

NEW YORK   Several U S  states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday to undo its recent decision that allowed fewer whole grains and more sodium in school breakfasts and lunches The states accused the U S  Department of Agriculture of ignoring federal dietary guidelines and scientific research on children s nutrition when it eased rules championed by former first lady Michelle Obama to make school meals healthier New York  California  Illinois  Minnesota  New Mexico  Vermont and the District of Columbia said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue acted in an  arbitrary and capricious  manner  and asked a Manhattan federal judge to void the new sodium and whole grain standards  The Trump administration has undermined key health benefits for our children       with deliberate disregard for science  expert opinion  and the law   New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement Spokespeople for the Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to requests for comment The changes announced last Dec  6 affect the federally funded National School Lunch Program  which was started by President Harry Truman in 1946 and feeds more than 30 million  mostly lower income children They are among a series of White House supported efforts to roll back federal regulatory oversight that President Donald Trump considers burdensome to business and economic growth The changes included cutting in half the amount of whole grains required to be served starting in the 2019 20 school year  affording schools more flexibility to offer noodles  tortillas and other foods containing mainly refined grains They also included a five year delay in the maximum sodium target scheduled for the next school year  and elimination of a sodium target set for the 2022 23 school year Perdue has said his agency was committed to nutritious meals in schools  but the changes acknowledged the  challenges  that schools face serving appetizing yet healthy meals  while ensuring that food would not be wasted  Other changes included allowing schools to serve low fat chocolate milk  rather than fat free milk The new rules set aside requirements under the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010  which Michelle Obama had supported in her fight against child obesity It had set new limits for calories  sodium and trans fats  while requiring more fruits  vegetables and whole grains Excessive sodium intake has been linked to heart disease  high blood pressure and stroke  while relatively higher refined grain consumption has been linked to type 2 diabetes  heart disease and obesity The case is New York et al v  U S  Department of Agriculture et al  U S  District Court  Southern District of New York  No  19 02956

SAN DIEGO EL PASO  Texas   Trucks inched through traffic and some stores reported fewer customers in U S  Mexico border towns on Wednesday as staffing shortages tied to a surge in asylum seekers slowed checkpoints and threats of the border closing scared away shoppers U S  President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to close the border  or parts of it  saying Congress could avert such a shutdown by changing laws to fix what he called immigration  loopholes  Business leaders on both sides of the border have lashed out against the threat  saying a shutdown would hurt supply chains and  1 7 billion in daily trade at some of the world s busiest land crossings  Words have meaning  especially when they come from the White House  The mere threat of a border closure does create uncertainty  and uncertainty is the enemy of jobs  economic development and commerce   said Jon Barela  who runs Borderplex Alliance  a U S  Mexico trade and economic development group Already

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump took a step back on Tuesday from his threat to close the U S  southern border to fight illegal immigration  as pressure mounted from companies worried that a shutdown would cause chaos to supply chains Trump threatened on Friday to close the border this week unless Mexico acted  He repeated that threat on Tuesday but said he had not made a decision yet   We re going to see what happens over the next few days   Closing the border could disrupt millions of legal crossings and billions of dollars in trade  Auto companies have been warning the White House privately that it would lead to the idling of U S  plants within days because they rely on prompt deliveries of components made in Mexico The U S  Chamber of Commerce  the largest U S  business lobbying group  has been in contact with the White House to discuss the  very negative economic consequences that would occur across the country   said Neil Bradley  the group s top lobbyist  on a call with reporters  Trump praised efforts by Mexico to hinder illegal immigration from Central America at its own southern border  On Monday  the Mexican government said it would help regulate the flow of migrants  I really wanted to close it   Trump said on Tuesday night at a fundraiser for congressional Republicans The Mexican government has not published apprehension statistics  but a senior White House official said it had provided daily updates to the Trump administration  including specific apprehension numbers  They say they re going to stop them  Let s see  They have the power to stop them  they have the laws to stop them   Trump said earlier on Tuesday PUSH BACKTrump has made fighting illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America a key part of his agenda  but shutting down one of the world s most used borders might be a step too far  even for many of his fellow Republicans  Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell joined Democrats in warning Trump against such a move  Closing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country and I would hope we would not be doing that sort of thing   McConnell told reporters on Tuesday A group representing General Motors Co  Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said in a statement that  any action that stops commerce at the border would be harmful to the U S  economy  and in particular  the auto industry   Dozens of U S  vehicle  engine  transmission and other auto parts plants could close because of a lack of components in the days after a border shutdown  It would also prevent thousands of vehicles built in Mexico from landing in U S  dealer showrooms Automakers exported nearly 2 6 million Mexican made vehicles to the United States in 2018  accounting for 15 percent of all vehicles sold in the country  Some  like the Chevrolet Blazer SUV  are only made in Mexico  Retailers are also raising alarm bells  according to officials with two groups that represent hundreds of U S  retail firms  It will be unprecedented self inflicted pain   said David French  senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation   We are still nervous about this and we have been talking to some of our companies about maybe ramping up direct pressure on the White House by getting CEOs to call   SLOWER BORDERSenior U S  Department of Homeland Security officials said on Tuesday a recent redeployment of some 750 officers on the border to deal with a surge in migrants   mostly Central American families turning themselves in to border agents   had already led to a slowing of legal crossings and commerce at ports of entry  Wait times in Brownsville  Texas  were around 180 minutes  which were two times the peaks of last year   said a senior DHS official on a call with reporters   We ended the day yesterday at Otay Mesa  California  with a backup of 150 trucks that hadn t been processed   the official said  Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Tuesday that backups were delaying commercial traffic at the U S  Mexico border at several crossings  He said the government had not drastically changed its migration strategy following the shutdown threats DHS officials said border facilities had been overwhelmed by families seeking asylum  fleeing poverty and violence in Central America  DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Manuel Padilla  a 30 year veteran of the U S  Border Patrol  would now serve as the agency s coordinator on the border response U S  Customs and Border Protection estimated that some 100 000 migrants were apprehended or encountered at the border in March  the highest level in a decade   The system is on fire   a DHS official said Because of limits on how long children are legally allowed to be held in detention  many of the families are released to await U S  immigration court hearings  a process that can take years because of ballooning backlogs  To try to address the problem  the Trump administration in January started sending some migrants to wait out their U S  court dates in Mexican border cities  On Monday  DHS said it would dramatically ramp up that program  despite court challenges The biggest priority for Nielsen is to seek action from Congress to change the immigration laws  said a DHS official  She sent a letter to Congress last week repeating many of the Trump administration s demands  including a request to quickly deport Central American minors that cross the border alone  Under current law  minors who are not from the contiguous countries of Canada and Mexico are placed in the care of sponsors in the United States  which Nielsen called a  dangerous  pull  factor  for migrants  Migrant advocates and some Democrats in Congress oppose the proposed legislative changes  saying they would send vulnerable children back to dangerous situations in their home countries  Trump said he had spoken with  a few  Democrats on Tuesday about the administration s proposals and added   They re changing their minds    Reporting by Roberta Rampton  Steve Holland and David Shepardson in Washington and Mica Rosenberg in New York  Additional

WASHINGTON   Some of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigators have told associates that the findings of their probe are more damaging for President Donald Trump than Attorney General William Barr indicated in his four page summary  the New York Times reported on Wednesday Citing government officials and others familiar with the situation  the Times said some members of Mueller s team believe Barr should have included more of their material in the summary he released on March 24 of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U S  presidential campaign  The Times said the officials and other sources declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Barr explained It was also not clear how widespread among Mueller s team  which included dozens of lawyers and investigators  are concerns about differences between Barr s summary and Mueller s report  the Times said Peter Carr  a spokesman for Mueller  declined to comment  The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Barr  a Trump appointee  said in the summary that Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election Barr also said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice  Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller s inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump Trump and the White House have hailed the conclusions as a victory for the president  who has denied conspiring with Russians or obstructing justice The attorney general has pledged to release the nearly 400 page report by mid April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence gathering sources and methods The Democratic led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to enable its chairman  Jerrold Nadler  to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller s unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides  including political strategist Steve Bannon   Reporting by Eric Beech  additional reporting by Karen Freifeld and Mohammad Zargham  Editing by Leslie Adler  

WASHINGTON   The U S  government granted waivers to just 6 percent of visa applicants subject to its travel ban on a handful of countries during the first 11 months of the ban  new data reviewed by Reuters shows Trump administration officials have pointed to the waiver process embedded in the travel ban as proof it was not motivated by animus toward Muslims  as critics have charged  but rather serves to protect the United States In June 2018  after legal challenges defeated earlier iterations of the ban  the Supreme Court upheld a revised version and wrote in its majority opinion that the waiver program supported the government s claims that the ban served  a legitimate national security interest  But new data shows that only 6 percent of people subject to the travel ban were ultimately granted waivers during the first 11 months of the ban s full implementation Between Dec  8  2017 and Oct  31  2018  State Department officers ruled on nearly 38 000 applications for non immigrant and immigrant visas filed by people subject to the travel ban who otherwise qualified for the visas and needed waivers to get them They determined that just 6 percent   or 2 216 applicants   met the criteria for a waiver  Of those  670 had not yet received their visas but were expected to do so  The data was provided in a Feb  22 letter from Assistant Secretary of State Mary Taylor to Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen  The letter was received by Van Hollen s office on Wednesday  and his office provided it to Reuters  This data paints a clear   and deeply disturbing   picture of the Trump travel ban   Van Hollen said in a statement to Reuters   The administration repeatedly swore to the Supreme Court and the American people that this was not a de facto Muslim ban and that there was a clear waiver process to ensure fairness  That couldn t be further from reality  A State Department spokesman said on condition of anonymity that  a consular officer carefully reviews each case to determine if the applicant is covered  by the travel ban and  if so  whether the case qualifies for a waiver  The travel ban blocks citizens of Iran  Libya  North Korea  Somalia  Syria and Yemen  as well as some Venezuelan officials and their relatives  from obtaining a broad range of U S  immigrant and non immigrant visas  Chad was previously covered by the ban but was removed in April 2018  The latest data show a slight increase in the waiver issuance rate  Data from December 2017 through April 2018 showed that waivers were issued in 2 percent of visa applications filed by people subject to the travel ban TREMENDOUS HARDSHIPSThe ban s restrictions vary from country to country   Somalis  for instance  can receive short term visas and Iranians are allowed to get student visas  while North Koreans are blocked from all visas In addition to the almost 38 000 applications considered for a travel ban waiver  around 8 100 by people from countries subject to the travel ban were refused in the 11 month period for reasons unrelated to the ban  and nearly 2 600 applicants were found eligible for visas based on exceptions to the ban and thus did not need a waiver Critics say the waiver process is shrouded in secrecy  with vague standards and little information given to applicants about how they can qualify or apply for one  Two federal lawsuits are contesting the fairness of the process The official criteria for a waiver is a three part test assessing whether denying entry to an applicant would cause  undue hardship   if entry of the person would not pose a threat to the United States  and if entry would be in the national interest  There is no application for a waiver   the State Department says it  automatically  considers applicants for them  They  the State Department  are actually actively telling applicants   We don t want your materials in support of a waiver    said Mahsa Khanbabai  an immigration attorney in Massachusetts who has clients subject to the ban   Even in the cases where they do take them  the extraordinary amount of time that it takes to make a decision causes tremendous hardships for people     Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati  Editing by Kieran Murray and Daniel Wallis

Interior Department  continued to lobby for a major client several months after he filed official papers saying that he had ended his lobbying activities The bill for Mr  Bernhardt s services  dated March 2017 and labeled  Federal Lobbying   shows  along with other newly disclosed documents  Mr  Bernhardt working closely with the Westlands Water District as late as April 2017  the month Mr  Trump nominated him to his current job  deputy interior secretary  In November 2016  Mr  Bernhardt had filed legal notice with the federal government formally ending his status as a lobbyist  Westlands  a powerful California agribusiness group  was one of Mr  Bernhardt s main lobbying and legal clients between 2011 and 2016  During that time  Westlands paid Mr  Bernhardt s firm  1 3 million for lobbying services  A New York Times investigation this year revealed how Mr  Bernhardt made it a priority at the Interior Department to promote policies long sought by Westlands  including a weakening of Endangered Species Act protections for a rare fish  Those changes would have led to the release of vast amounts of water from the delicate ecosystem of the San Francisco Bay Delta for irrigation of commercial farmland A spokeswoman for Mr  Bernhardt  Faith Vander Voort  said in an email that the invoice had been labeled incorrectly and that the documents did not describe lobbying activity   David Bernhardt did not engage in regulated lobbying activities for Westlands Water District from the date he de registered forward   she wrote   Mr  Bernhardt engaged in various legal services that supported the senior employees and Directors of the Board of Westlands Water District  who are public officials  operating in their official capacity  These efforts do not constitute regulated lobbying activity  Westlands Water District did not respond to a request for comment The Senate Energy Committee voted 14 6 on Thursday to send Mr  Bernhardt s nomination as interior secretary to the full Senate for a confirmation vote  In committee hearings  Democrats criticized Mr  Bernhardt as beholden to industry while Republicans praised his depth of knowledge  Two Democrats  Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico  and one independent  Senator Angus King of Maine  voted with Republicans in favor of Mr  Bernhardt s confirmation  Senator Lisa Murkowski  the Alaska Republican who leads the committee  said of Mr  Bernhardt Thursday morning   There are accusations about his ethics  I think it s very clear you ve got some well funded groups that are working hard against him  She added   I am aware of no substantiation of them whatsoever  I would be stunned if they would be substantiated  We have known about this previous work he had at Westlands  The documents  including the March 2017  Federal Lobbying  invoice sent to Westlands by Mr  Bernhardt s former firm  were obtained under California open records law by the office of the California attorney general  Xavier Becerra  and by the environmental advocacy group Pacific Advocates  They were reviewed by The New York Times The invoice itemizes the costs of services described as  Westlands Trip   taken by Mr  Bernhardt in late January and early February 2017 from Washington through Denver  Sacramento and Chicago before heading back to Washington  It includes a charge of  2 432 68 for Mr  Bernhardt s travel  as well as a  25 000 charge  for professional services rendered  in February 2017  During the previous year  a period when Mr  Bernhardt was an official registered lobbyist  Westlands paid his firm a  25 000 monthly fee  Lara Day  a spokeswoman for Mr  Bernhardt s former firm  Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck  reiterated that the description of Mr  Bernhardt s work in February 2017 as  Federal Lobbying  was an error   I can confirm that David was not doing federal lobbying   she said Mr  Bernhardt s spokeswoman  Ms  Vander Voort  also said the work performed by Mr  Bernhardt in 2017 did not constitute  regulated lobbying   Several experts who reviewed the documents offered a different interpretation  They pointed out that the documents appear to show Mr  Bernhardt meeting with  and communicating with  federal officials to advocate for policy matters on behalf of a paying client  which is the basic work of lobbying  The action described by the documents  raises ethical questions   said Virginia Canter  the chief ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  a watchdog group   He obviously was engaged in some sort of federal lobbying activity on behalf of Westlands even after he de registered as a lobbyist  Mr  Bernhardt s activities  if they constituted lobbying  could violate federal laws requiring lobbyists to disclose their activities  according to four independent authorities on the rules  The documents include several emails with Johnny Amaral and Thomas Birmingham  the two officials at Westlands who worked closely on federal lobbying matters with Mr  Bernhardt during the time he was a registered lobbyist  They include an email dated December 2016 from John Watts  an aide to Senator Dianne Feinstein  a California Democrat who works on the state s water policy issues  to Mr  Bernhardt and Mr  Birmingham  The subject line is  Memo  Endangered Species Act consistency of California water language   It addresses two issues  endangered species and water rights  on which Mr  Bernhard had lobbied for Westlands On Jan  2  2017  Mr  Bernhardt emailed Mr  Amaral and Mr  Birmingham with  a short draft letter  addressed to Representative David Valadao  Republican of California   expressing appreciation  for the lawmaker s successful efforts to include legislative language related to a water infrastructure bill on which Mr  Bernhardt had already officially lobbied  and thanking the representative for his work on another bill related to water policy in the Central Valley  The final letter sent by Westlands to Mr  Valadao contained several passages identical to those drafted by Mr  Bernhardt On Dec  8  2016  the water infrastructure bill passed the House and Mr  Bernhardt emailed Mr  Amaral expressing optimism that the bill would easily win in the Senate as well Mr  Amaral responded   You re winning all kinds of bets aren t you  We should be going to Vegas     Mr  Bernhardt replied   There is no way it will fail in the Senate  Over the course of the first half of 2017  Mr  Amaral sent several emails to Mr  Bernhardt and a small group of Westlands officials referring to the group s weekly  team  telephone calls  Another email  dated April 19  2017  from Mr  Amaral  asked Mr  Bernhardt if he could make it to a  team breakfast  the following Wednesday  April 25  Bernhardt responded   Yes   Three days later  Mr  Trump nominated Mr  Bernhardt to be deputy secretary of the Interior Department Mr  Amaral now works for another California water district  the Friant Water Authority  He did not respond to voice mail or text messages sent to his cellphone  Ethics experts said the documents shed light on the close relationship Mr  Bernhardt maintained with his former lobbying client   The fact that he is attending a  team breakfast  with Westlands just days before he s nominated is a shocking level of connection with this lobbying client at a moment he is about to enter government   said Delaney Marsco  ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center  a nonpartisan watchdog group   It goes to this deep  intertwined relationship that he had  ImageCashew

WASHINGTON   Some of Robert S  Mueller III s investigators have told associates that Attorney General William P  Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr  Barr indicated  according to government officials and others familiar with their simmering frustrations At stake in the dispute   the first evidence of tension between Mr  Barr and the special counsel s office   is who shapes the public s initial understanding of one of the most consequential government investigations in American history  Some members of Mr  Mueller s team are concerned that  because Mr  Barr created the first narrative of the special counsel s findings  Americans  views will have hardened before the investigation s conclusions become public Mr  Barr has said he will move quickly to release the nearly 400 page report but needs time to scrub out confidential information  The special counsel s investigators had already written multiple summaries of the report  and some team members believe that Mr  Barr should have included more of their material in the four page letter he wrote on March 24 laying out their main conclusions  according to government officials familiar with the investigation  Mr  Barr only briefly cited the special counsel s work in his letter ImageListen to  The Daily   New Insights Into the Mueller

general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four page summary  Members of the special counsel s team say something was lost michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  The Mueller team sent its report to the attorney general  William Barr  The attorney general sent a summary of that report to Congress  Now  new reporting shows members of Mueller s team feel that Barr s summary did not reflect the report they wrote  It s Thursday  April 4  So take us back to the beginning of last week  What do we know at that point nicholas fandosSo we knew that Bill Barr  taking Bob Mueller s 300  to 400 page report  had gone through it extensively and boiled down what he called the  principal conclusions  to just four pages michael barbaroNick Fandos covers Congress  Mike Schmidt covers national security michael schmidtWe were in this unusual situation where the special counsel  Robert Mueller  had sent his report to the attorney general  said  I found no evidence that the campaign conspired with Russia to impact the election  But he declined to make a decision on obstruction nicholas fandosAnd what he said was Mueller didn t reach what Barr called a  traditional prosecutorial decision   In other words  Mueller presented evidence for the fact that the president may have obstructed justice but didn t go as far as to conclude that he had  He essentially punted to the attorney general s office michael schmidtAnd in this case  by Mueller not reaching a determination  he leaves the door open for Barr to come in to say  O K   Mueller didn t make a determination on this issue of obstruction  He did on collusion  I m going to look at all the facts  And he makes his determination   no case to be made here on both of these issues  The problem  though  is that the perception is that Mueller  the independent investigator who s there to do an inquiry free of politics  has not made a call on this central question  But Barr  the president s appointee  who s been there just for a few months  is making the decision  So the question is  is the fix in  Why is it  if Mueller didn t come to an answer  the attorney general did michael barbaroSo at the beginning of last week  we know that Mueller made the unusual decision not to make a call  And Barr made the unusual decision to make a call  And the question is  why michael schmidtIt s not unusual that Barr made a call  The Justice Department is there to decide whether people broke the law or not  And he was doing that  What s different and unusual here is that Barr and Mueller don t look like they re on the same page  music michael schmidtMueller said  I can t make a determination on this issue  And Barr did  So why is it that they looked at it differently  Why was it that Mueller  the prosecutor here  didn t do the one thing that prosecutors at the Justice Department do  which is make a call nicholas fandosAnd that was the question that we ve spent the last week trying to figure out  What is the difference here  What is the evidence that they re looking at  And why did Mueller and Barr make the decisions that they made around this question of obstruction of justice michael barbaroAnd what have we now learned nicholas fandosWhat we ve now learned is that nobody s happy  The team that was working   or at least some of the team that was working with Bob Mueller feels that Barr stepped in and filled the vacuum in a way that didn t properly capture what their 22 month investigation found  And Barr s team feels that Bob Mueller fell short of doing his job michael barbaroSo let s start with the Barr side  Explain more about why the attorney general and those around him are upset michael schmidtSo in not reaching a decision on obstruction of justice  Barr has to go out on his own and make that determination without the top cover of the independent investigator who went out and was supposed to make a determination on whether the president broke the law michael barbaroAnd what do you mean by  top cover  michael schmidtOne of the reasons you have a special counsel is to insulate an investigation from politics and then  when the investigation is concluded  have a way of holding up the product of the inquiry  the fruits of it  to the public and saying  look  this was done free of politics  We assessed this matter based on the facts  And now you have a result that is exposed  at least in part  to the perception that the president s guy made the decision michael barbaroThe attorney general michael schmidtCorrect nicholas fandosUndercutting one of the key points of Mueller s appointment in the first place michael barbaroAnd you re saying that the people in the Justice Department and that Barr himself are upset to be put in that position michael schmidtWell  the system s not working the way it s supposed to  You had Mueller there for one reason   yea or nay on crimes  And on one of these central questions  he couldn t get there  And by stepping back and saying  I don t know  it allows at least the Democrats to say  what  How was this decision made  How did they get to this  How is it that the president s political appointee was the ultimate decider nicholas fandosAnd it gives them real credence to go and say  we need to see all the evidence  We need to see the whole file here because the president s handpicked man made this decision  Maybe we d reach a different conclusion if we looked at the evidence  Bob Mueller seems to have michael barbaroSo then why did Barr choose to make a call on obstruction of justice if he knew and was upset that this was going to be seen as hyper political and that it would fan the flames of Democrats in Congress nicholas fandosThe problem for Barr was that when he got the report and looked at the evidence  to him  it was a pretty clear case that you would not press this kind of charge  that the president hadn t obstructed justice  Now  you ve got to remember that Barr comes to the job with a pretty expansive view of executive power  As Democrats made famous  he wrote a memo before he was appointed attorney general arguing that certain acts by the president shouldn t be construed as obstruction of justice  They re part of his executive powers  And so he looked at this and  I mean  he can t make the same decision that Mueller did  Somebody has to make a choice about whether or not this is a chargeable offense  And he looked at it and says  well  in our judgment and this team s judgment  it s not michael barbaroSo Barr reads the report and thinks  what are you talking about it s not clear whether or not there was obstruction of justice  There  in his mind  clearly wasn t nicholas fandosBarr does acknowledge that there is evidence  basically  of behavior that could be construed as obstructive  He gives credence to what Mueller is presenting but says  when you add it all up  it doesn t tip into  michael schmidtCriminality nicholas fandos  criminal obstructive territory michael barbaroRight  And while it felt political for Barr to reach a conclusion  to make a call that Mueller wouldn t  I have to think it would have felt even more political in Barr s mind for Congress to be the one to perform that role  And so he was upset to have to make this call  but  it sounds like  felt that he had to michael schmidtI don t know if he s upset as much as he looks at this situation and says  this is not the way it s supposed to be working  Someone needs to make a decision on whether the president broke the law  I ll step in and do that  And I think I can do that based on the facts nicholas fandosAnd Congress can still play a role  I m redacting the report  I ll give it to you with sensitive information blacked out  And then you can make your own judgment  But the public has an intense interest in this  And I ve got to say something  And I decide whether acts broke the law or not  And I don t think this one did michael barbaroDo we know if Mueller s team expected Barr to make this call on obstruction of justice after they declined to do so nicholas fandosWe don t know precisely what the Mueller team expected on this obstruction question  It seems that they were not clear in communicating to the Justice Department what they wanted  It may not have mattered anyway  But what we do know is that after Barr came out with this four page summary  which essentially exonerated the president on collusion and said he did not break the law on obstruction  some members of Mr  Mueller s team felt that he had inadequately and only partially represented the work of their 22 month investigation michael barbaroSo this is the other side of your reporting   that not only was the Barr side disappointed with the Mueller side  the Mueller side was disappointed with the Barr side nicholas fandosWhat we have learned is that since Barr made his public statement about a week ago  members of the Mueller team have told associates that they feel  essentially  that his work   if it wasn t misrepresentative of theirs   didn t give the full picture  which they believe is more damaging to the president than the attorney general s letter lets on  Now  we are not saying that every member of the Mueller team is frustrated by this  We don t know what Bob Mueller himself thinks  He remains one of the black boxes at the center of this investigation  But there are members of the team who were involved in the decision making around these issues that we ve been talking about who have watched and been disappointed and angry about how it s being characterized michael barbaroAnd what is the focus of their disappointment  to the degree you understand it nicholas fandosSo when they read Bill Barr s concise four page letter  they were frustrated that he had not drawn more from their own work  And in fact  what we discovered in reporting this piece out is that they had prepared summaries of their own work that were part of the report that they handed over to the Justice Department a couple of weeks ago and felt that some of that material could have easily been drawn into what Mr  Barr handed over  So not that he shouldn t have made a decision about whether the president obstructed justice or not in a criminal sense  but that concurrent with that  he should have put out more of their evidence or analysis to fill out the public picture  The Justice Department says those summaries had sensitive information in them  classified information  secretive grand jury information that couldn t become public  and ultimately didn t use any of it michael schmidtSo what Mueller s folks are essentially saying is  hey  we wrote these summaries  If you were going to go out and say something about this investigation  and you were going to do something as extreme or as declarative as clearing the president  why is it that you didn t include some of the things that we found michael barbaroAnd specifically  why didn t you include some stuff that we found that was pretty damning  You re making it seem like the president didn t do anything wrong michael schmidtDonald Trump has come out in the days after Barr s declaration and said the Mueller report was beautiful  And it completely exonerates him  If you re an investigator who spent the last two years looking at Donald Trump  and you think there s a lot of questionable behavior there  that is something that is going to irritate you mightily michael barbaroI mean  do either of you think that the Mueller people have a legitimate point here  Or is this a classic case of pride of authorship  They wanted to see their work in the public summary nicholas fandosI don t think that we fully know  What seems clear in our reporting is that there was no specific communication or agreement by the Mueller team to the Barr team   you should use these things  or we want these things to be out  They seem to have had an intention  And they certainly now have a regret about it  But we don t know what interaction there was in the actual decision making process that happened that weekend two weeks ago michael barbaroWell  so why do we think that Barr chose not to include more of what was in these summaries  especially the negative material  in his four page summary michael schmidtI think there s one big  broad reason and another contemporary reason  the broad reason being that Barr and many Justice Department officials and  for many years  prosecutors believe that if they decide not to charge someone  the fruits of the investigation should not be just thrown out there for the public or for the enemies of the person who were investigated michael barbaroDirty laundry should not be aired if the subject of those dirty laundry are not charged with a crime michael schmidtIf you cannot meet this incredibly high bar of bringing a federal prosecution  that doesn t mean you then get to just take the trash and just throw it out in the street and let the public rummage through it michael barbaroAnd Mike  by the contemporary example you referred to  I m assuming you re talking about James Comey michael schmidtI m talking about the July 2016 press conference that James Comey held  It s right in the heat of the presidential election  He stands up and says  we  the F B I   have done this investigation into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email account  We don t think there is a case to be made here  But we found some very questionable behavior in how she handled sensitive national security secrets  The press conference was seen as very damaging to Clinton even though a case was never made michael barbaroAnd so you re saying that Barr s view would be  I m not going to be the one to replicate that by drawing from these Mueller team summaries and putting those out into the public sphere michael schmidtCorrect  We don t use criminal investigations to go out and find damaging things that may not be crimes that we then simply release to the public to be used against someone nicholas fandosThe problem is  this was never a normal or average criminal investigation  It has broad national security implications  And it has implications for almost every decision that s made at the highest levels of the government michael schmidtThis is more about a pathway of how you deal with the president s conduct  And what it appears from the Mueller side is that they re saying  look  this is the president of the United States  There s some conduct here that we think the public and Congress should see  And O K   Justice Department  it may not be criminal  But this is the president  And this needs to be examined more thoroughly by the political process and by Congress  It s about a pathway of dealing with the president nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr doesn t seem to disagree with that  fundamentally  He said throughout that he wants to make as much of this report public as possible  But he doesn t think that that absolves him of the Justice Department s role of saying whether or not the president or his campaign broke the law  And so he s grappling with the Justice Department s aversion to talk about individuals that it s not saying broke the law  But yet he knows that the public and the Congress want and probably are owed more information about what did happen  And so he s kind of operating somewhere in the middle of those two things michael schmidtThe difference here is that if I was under investigation  and the Justice Department determined that I didn t break the law  then there s no other process that really needs to be dealt with me  Maybe my company needs to decide whether I get fired or not for that conduct  In this instance  there s another issue with the president  O K   the president didn t break the law  But maybe the president did things with his power that the public should know about  Congress should know about  and need to be more closely examined  Because maybe it s not just about breaking the law  It s about how he conducted himself as president  And does Congress need to deal with that  And what we are starting to see from Mueller s side is this frustration that  hey  we think there s some bad stuff that happened here  But by Barr coming out and not disclosing that but saying the president didn t break the law  he is casting the die on how the public will later look at the president s conduct  It will say that for several weeks after we finished our report  the only thing that was out there was Bill Barr saying the president didn t break the law  and the president turning around and saying  I was fully exonerated  And they re saying  hey  America  we think more of this process needs to play out michael barbaroRight michael schmidtSo this all comes down to the vexing question of  how do we investigate a sitting president  And how is that done in a way that the public has the utmost confidence in that  And in that is this tension between how much independence the investigator should have  In Nixon  that pendulum swung too far in the president s direction  In the Starr investigation of Clinton  it went the other way  The investigator had too much power  And here  between Mueller and Barr s teams  they are fighting that same fight and have different understandings of how this should all be dealt with  And it s the same issue that we ve been looking at for 50 years  just the latest episode of it michael barbaroSo inside of one presidential investigation  these two teams are embodying all the tensions that have basically been present since Watergate nicholas fandosCorrect michael schmidtIt s how much you can tell the public  and how is apparent misconduct by the president dealt with  And there s no clear pathway on that  So whatever Barr does will be viewed by one side as political and laying on the brakes for the president  Whatever Mueller does will be viewed by the president s enemies as trying to get him  And the confidence in that process then erodes  And it s messy  And it s hard to figure out  What are the real facts here  What really happened michael barbaroBut at this point  we re just talking about the summary that Bill Barr sent to Congress  We re still waiting on the full report  So won t this tension that you re describing eventually be more or less resolved when we learn how much information we ll ultimately have access to nicholas fandosIt may be  And we may see a very different set of facts at the end of the day  But I think the question here is about who sets the narrative for the intervening period of time  It may end up being a month before we see a fuller version of the Mueller report  And for that time  Bill Barr s conclusion that the president didn t break the law is going to be the dominant narrative  And I think that what we re hearing from members of the Mueller team is a concern that by the time their fuller work does come out  the narrative is baked   so much so that even if it shows  for instance  that the president didn t break the law but abused his office or conducted acts that Congress will deem inappropriate for his office  that there s not room to have a full debate around that  that the conclusions about the work that they did for 22 months will have been prejudged at that point  and that it won t quite matter what the report says for the president s political fate michael barbaroNick  Mike  thank you very much nicholas fandosThank you guys michael schmidtThanks for having us archived recording  jerry nadler The committee has a job to do  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct michael barbaroOn Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the use of subpoenas to obtain a full copy of the Mueller report archived recording  jerry nadler That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence michael barbaroThe committee s chairman  Democratic representative Jerry Nadler of New York  said he would not immediately issue a subpoena  But his power to do so will intensify pressure on the attorney general  William Barr  to quickly release an unredacted copy of the report archived recording  jerry nadler I will give him time to change his mind  But if we cannot reach an accommodation  then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials michael barbaroWe ll be right back  music michael barbaroHere s what else you need to know today  A Times analysis of deadly terror attacks involving white extremists has found that at least a third of them were inspired by fellow white men who carried out similar attacks and had either professed admiration for them or interest in their tactics  In one case  a school shooter in New Mexico corresponded with a gunman who attacked a mall in Munich  All together  the two men killed 11 people  The connections between the killers crossed continents and highlight how the internet and social media have spread white extremism  And  archived recording  joe biden I ve always

 quite frankly   life  for that matter   is about connecting michael barbaroThat s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow However  the special counsel s office never asked Mr  Barr to release the summaries soon after he received the report  a person familiar with the investigation said  And the Justice Department quickly determined that the summaries contain sensitive information  like classified material  secret grand jury testimony and information related to current federal investigations that must remain confidential  according to two government officials The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III Mr  Barr was also wary of departing from Justice Department practice not to disclose derogatory details in closing an investigation  according to two government officials familiar with Mr  Barr s thinking  They pointed to the decision by James B  Comey  the former F B I  director  to harshly criticize Hillary Clinton in 2016 while announcing that he was recommending no charges in the inquiry into her email practices The officials and others interviewed declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Mr  Barr explained  although the report is believed to examine Mr  Trump s efforts to thwart the investigation  It was unclear how much discussion Mr  Mueller and his investigators had with senior Justice Department officials about how their findings would be made public  It was also unclear how widespread the vexation is among the special counsel team  which included 19 lawyers  about 40 F B I  agents and other personnel At the same time  Mr  Barr and his advisers have expressed their own frustrations about Mr  Mueller and his team  Mr  Barr and other Justice Department officials believe the special counsel s investigators fell short of their task by declining to decide whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed the inquiry  according to the two government officials  After Mr  Mueller made no judgment on the obstruction matter  Mr  Barr stepped in to declare that he himself had cleared Mr  Trump of wrongdoing Representatives for the Justice Department and the special counsel declined to comment on Wednesday on views inside both Mr  Mueller s office and the Justice Department  They pointed to departmental regulations requiring Mr  Mueller to file a confidential report to the attorney general detailing prosecution decisions and to Mr  Barr s separate vow to send a redacted version of that report to Congress  Under the regulations  Mr  Barr can publicly release as much of the document as he deems appropriate Read Attorney General William Barr s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter  by Attorney General William P  Barr  details the main findings of the special counsel s two year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election A debate over how the special counsel s conclusions are represented has played out in public as well as in recent weeks  with Democrats in Congress accusing Mr  Barr of intervening to color the outcome of the investigation in the president s favor In his letter to Congress outlining the report s chief conclusions  Mr  Barr said that Mr  Mueller found no conspiracy between Mr  Trump s campaign and Russia s 2016 election interference  While Mr  Mueller made no decision on his other main question  whether the president illegally obstructed the inquiry  he explicitly stopped short of exonerating Mr  Trump Mr  Mueller s decision to skip a prosecutorial judgment  leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime   Mr  Barr wrote  He and his deputy  Rod J  Rosenstein  decided that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that Mr  Trump had committed an obstruction offense Mr  Barr has come under criticism for sharing so little  But according to officials familiar with the attorney general s thinking  he and his aides limited the details they revealed because they were worried about wading into political territory  Mr  Barr and his advisers expressed concern that if they included derogatory information about Mr  Trump while clearing him  they would face a storm of criticism like what Mr  Comey endured in the Clinton investigation VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S  Mueller III s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started CreditCreditDoug Mills The New York TimesLegal experts attacked Mr  Comey at the time for violating Justice Department practice to keep confidential any negative information about anyone uncovered during investigations  The practice exists to keep from unfairly sullying people s reputations without giving them a chance to respond in court Mr  Rosenstein cited the handling of the Clinton case in a memo the White House used to rationalize Mr  Trump s firing of Mr  Comey Though it was not clear what findings the special counsel s investigators viewed as troubling for the president  Mr  Barr has suggested that Mr  Mueller may have found evidence of malfeasance in investigating possible obstruction of justice   The report sets out evidence on both sides of the question   Mr  Barr wrote in his March 24 letter Mr  Mueller examined Mr  Trump s attempts to maintain control over the investigation  including his firing of Mr  Comey and his attempt to oust Mr  Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to install a loyalist to oversee the inquiry Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation The fallout from Mr  Barr s letter outlining the Russia investigation s main findings overshadowed his intent to make public as much of the entire report as possible  a goal he has stressed since his confirmation hearing in January  He reiterated to lawmakers on Friday that he wanted both Congress and the public to read the report and said that the department would by mid April furnish a version with sensitive material blacked out  He offered to testify on Capitol Hill soon after turning over the report Mr  Barr  who took office in February  has shown flashes of frustration over how the unveiling of the investigation s findings has unfolded  In his follow up letter to lawmakers on Friday  he chafed at how the news media and some lawmakers had characterized his March 24 letter Mr  Barr and Mr  Mueller have been friends for 30 years  and Mr  Barr said during his confirmation hearing in January that he trusted Mr  Mueller to conduct an impartial investigation  He said he told Mr  Trump that Mr  Mueller was a  straight shooter who should be dealt with as such   Mr  Mueller served as the head of the Justice Department s criminal division when Mr  Barr was attorney general under George Bush  and their families are friends Mr  Barr s promises of transparency have done little to appease Democrats who control the House  The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to let its chairman use a subpoena to try to compel Mr  Barr to hand over a full copy of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence to Congress  The chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York  has not said when he will use the subpoena  but made clear on Wednesday that he did not trust Mr  Barr s characterization of what Mr  Mueller s team found  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct   Mr  Nadler said   That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence  Republicans  who have embraced Mr  Barr s letter clearing Mr  Trump  have accused the Democrats of trying to prolong the cloud over his presidency and urged them to move on Mr  Trump has fully embraced Mr  Barr s version of events  For days  he has pronounced the outcome of the investigation a  complete and total exoneration  and called for the Justice Department and his allies on Capitol Hill to investigate and hold accountable those responsible for opening the inquiry  

A 32 year old woman from China carrying four cellphones and a thumb drive infected with malware gained access to Mar a Lago during President Trump s visit to the Florida resort over the weekend  federal court records show The woman  identified as Yujing Zhang  had arrived at the Palm Beach resort and showed two Chinese passports when she sought to be admitted  saying she wanted to use the pool She was allowed to enter by Secret Service agents stationed outside the resort after the Mar a Lago security manager on duty verified that her last name matched the surname of a member of the club  according to a complaint filed in Federal District Court in South Florida When asked if she was the member s daughter   she did not give a definitive answer   the complaint said  It said she was permitted to enter and was escorted to the front desk in a valet driven golf cart Once inside  according to the account filed with the court  the woman said she was there to attend a United Nations Chinese American Association event later in the evening  But no such event existed  according to the complaint  so the club receptionist alerted the Secret Service  Though she had initially said she had come to use the pool  she was not carrying a swimsuit  the complaint said Ms  Zhang told the agent who questioned her on site that she was there for a  United Nations friendship event  and had arrived early to see the pool and take photos  She showed the agent an invitation to the supposed event   but it was in Chinese and no one present could read it At that point  the Secret Service agent escorted her off the property  The agent continued to question her  and when the agent suggested that she had unlawfully gained access to the club  she became  verbally aggressive  and was detained  the complaint states  From there  she was taken to the Secret Service s office in West Palm Beach During the second interview  Ms  Zhang told the authorities that a Chinese friend named Charles had told her to travel from Shanghai to Palm Beach in order to attend the United Nations friendship event and said that she should try to speak with a member of the president s family about Chinese and American foreign economic relations The agents were unable to learn more about Charles  as Ms  Zhang told them that she had only spoken to him via the Chinese instant messaging app WeChat When the authorities searched her belongings  they found that she was carrying four cellphones  a hard drive  a laptop and a thumb drive that was found to be infected with malware She was arrested at that point and charged with lying to a federal agent and gaining access to a restricted area At the time of the incident shortly after noon on Saturday  Mr  Trump was off site  at the nearby Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach  He did not return to the resort until 4 p m The Secret Service said in a statement that determining who gets access to Mar a Lago is up to the resort s management  entering the resort does not permit access to areas used by the president  which require additional security screening  it said It said agents do conduct a physical screening to make sure no prohibited items enter the property  and did so in the case of Ms  Zhang  After undergoing screening at the second Secret Service checkpoint the individual  per club protocol  was immediately met by club reception   the statement said   The Mar a Lago reception staff then determined that the individual should not have been authorized access by their staff and Secret Service agents took immediate action resulting in the arrest of the individual  Ms  Zhang s lawyer  a federal public defender  did not respond to a request for comment  nor did the management at Mar a Lago Access to Mr  Trump by Chinese nationals became an issue last month  when news media reports surfaced showing that a Chinese American woman in Florida who once owned a chain of Asian massage parlors that had been investigated for prostitution had attended a number of events there  and had been photographed there with the president and other officials The woman  Cindy Yang  collected contributions directed toward Mr  Trump s campaign from her friends  family and employees  and had a website on which she advertised that she could provide access to the Trump administration Ms  Yang had advertised an event for March 30   the day of Ms  Zhang s arrest   called the  International Leaders Elite Forum   described as a  once in a lifetime opportunity  and the first event at Mar a Lago with  the Chinese as the protagonist   The Miami Herald reported  The event was later canceled  Ms  Yang worked with an event promoter named Charles Lee  who runs a group called the United Nations Chinese Friendship Association  which is similar to the name of the event that Ms  Zhang cited  the newspaper reported The criminal complaint filed Monday did not draw any connection between Ms  Zhang and Ms  Yang or any of the Chinese American events scheduled over the weekend Elaborate security measures are set up around Mr  Trump s exclusive  members only club  which he frequently visits on weekends away from Washington  When the president is in town  roadblocks are set up in the street leading up to the resort and uniformed Secret Service agents typically establish a large security screening area across the street  with a large sign notifying visitors that they are entering a restricted area Mar a Lago club members are allowed past the initial screening checkpoint and inside the protective perimeter Security breaches surrounding American presidents have been a major issue in recent years There have been several cases of intruders scaling the White House fence and entering the grounds  In one episode in 2014  a man carrying a knife  Omar J  Gonzalez  managed to overpower a Secret Service agent inside the North Portico entrance and run through the ceremonial East Room before he was tackled Weeks after Mr  Trump took office  another man was able to elude multiple layers of security before being stopped near the entrance at the South Portico  In that case  Jonathan Tuan Anh Tran  who was carrying a backpack  jumped over a fence and came within several steps of the White House while the president was inside the residence In perhaps the most notable example  in 2009  a Virginia couple sneaked into a White House state dinner and shook hands with President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama as they stood in the receiving line  Known later as the  State Dinner crashers   the intrusion by Michaele and Tareq Salahi prompted an internal Secret Service investigation and demands for a congressional inquiry Security agents on several occasions in the past have had to turn away people who tried to enter the Mar a Lago resort  some with the apparent intention of approaching the president In several cases  according to The South Florida Sun Sentinel  which reviewed police incident reports  members of the public arrived and told security agents that they had arranged meetings with Mr  Trump A 27 year old Ohio man flew in to Palm Beach International Airport and was flagged to Secret Service agents in April 2018 after he told people he was planning to smoke marijuana with the president  a 32 year old Georgia man wearing military style fatigues told local sheriff s deputies in February of that year that he had an important message  about the war  to deliver to Mr  Trump Don Mihalek  executive vice president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association  which represents the Secret Service  said the episode showed how much the Secret Service relied on the security at Mar a Lago He said the fact that Secret Service agents apparently relied on the determination by a Mar a Lago security agent that Ms  Zhang was related to a member of the club   simply because she shared the member s last name   was problematic  It s a hard position for Secret Service to be in to potentially deny a million dollar committee member   Mr  Mihalek said   It puts Secret Service in a very difficult position because we don t know who are members and who aren t   You re depending on them to say this is an employee and this isn t an employee  We work off a list of names   he said   Our priority is  are you coming in with explosives or not  Ms  Zhang  who court records say was born in 1986  appeared in court in Palm Beach on Monday  and a bond hearing was scheduled for next week  court records show  

Gail Collins  Happy April  Bret  Since we re past Fools  Day  I will avoid any wisecracks about Donald Trump Where are you on the Mueller report  Ready to consign it to the dustbin of history  Demanding to see the full document  I have to admit I m sort of ready to give up and move on  Although you could definitely talk me back into the fold Bret Stephens  Four thoughts  Gail First  Thank God the president of the United States  whatever else we may think of him  did not collude with Russia to get himself elected  I d rather have a scoundrel in the White House than a traitor Gail  You re setting the bar pretty low there  but you re still right Bret  Second  Thank God we have a report at all   which  considering the vindication it brings Trump  and the vindictiveness it brings out of him    would not have happened if the Trumpists had gotten their way and Mueller had been fired  All of those conservatives who impugned Mueller s integrity and his team s impartiality owe them a giant apology Gail  Not holding my breath waiting  Go on Bret  Third  Thank God for Mueller himself  He didn t pontificate on the Sunday talk shows the way Jim Comey or Adam Schiff did  He didn t pull any punches when it came to prosecuting the likes of Paul Manafort  He ran a tight ship  He demonstrated that even in Washington there is no substitute for character  professionalism and reputation  That s why I suspect that when the full document is released  we ll be able to treat it as the last word on the subject Finally  The news media  especially cable news  needs to do some major soul searching  Too many reporters and pundits got way out ahead of their skis  creating a collusion narrative out of a series of unconnected dots  When historians examine why public confidence in journalism fell to such lows in our era  episodes like Russiagate will be a major part of the story Gail  You didn t have to believe Trump was actively engaged in a conspiracy to point out a whole lot of unnerving stuff going on  For instance  there s still a terrible potential for Russian sabotage via internet that this administration isn t taking seriously Bret  For sure  There was a lot of smoke  There were plenty of dots  The investigation was warranted  The president repeatedly behaved in ways that suggested guilt  from lying about his business ties to Russia to seizing his translator s notes after a conversation with Vladimir Putin to his cavalier attitude about Russia s intentions The media was right to report all this and raise questions  But there was also a lack of skepticism about some of the evidence  and a tone of certitude about where that evidence was bound to lead Gail  I ll give you the whole impeachment thing  That was perhaps over the top  But we re still waiting to hear the results of investigations into Trump   mainly his business practices   that are still going on here in New York Bret  I agree in the sense that I think his behavior as  Individual No  1  in the payoffs to former paramours are felony violations of campaign finance laws  But I m also becoming increasingly convinced that the endless investigations into Trump s past business practices are going to wind up doing more harm to Trump s opponents than they do to him  It makes him look like the victim of an endless inquest into his pre presidential behavior  And it distracts Democrats from talking about the things that Americans actually want from politicians  like better schools and a growing economy Gail  Glad you brought that up  I m way more interested in the attack on Obamacare than his unappetizing history in real estate What s your opinion on where to go with health care  I will start by acknowledging Obamacare is sort of a mess  It began as a mess because certain senators  cough  mutter  Joe Lieberman  were too deeply in the thrall of the insurance companies to let a sane restructuring occur Bret  Music to my ears  Gail  Obamacare is a mess  even if most Americans have learned to live with it  as we do with other messes   If it weren t a mess  Democrats wouldn t keep talking about  Medicare for all  as the next evolution in health care policy I think that s a huge mistake  both as a matter of policy and politics  It requires another major reorganization of a huge part of the U S  economy  Take Bernie Sanders s plan  for example  It s going to cost a bundle   an estimated  32 6 trillion over 10 years   and the taxes to fund it will have to come from middle class Americans  It will mean a declining quality of health care  And it will lead to a two tier system in which wealthy Americans go  off grid  to get high quality medical attention while the rest of the country is stuck in a system that will resemble the V A Trump will also be merciless about this  politically  claiming that this is just the sort of socialism he warned about in his State of the Union speech  And it will frighten a great many voters  including those all important suburban women  who might despise the president for all kinds of reasons but fear the Democrats are veering toward the Bernie Sanders left Gail  All the Democratic presidential candidates are not talking about Medicare for all  Some of the ones who did are trying to backpedal  not really having thought about what it meant before they went there  Three fifths of the adult population from 19 to 64 get their health insurance from employers  and a lot of them like it  They re going to get very nervous if they think they might have to give it up But we need sweeping change  Our current health care system is wildly expensive because it s structured in a crazy way that creates piles and piles of stupendously expensive paperwork  We could create a government run public policy option that would give people the security of Obamacare without the crazy structure  And gradually  if the option was attractive enough  employers might want to get in on it  too Bret  I definitely agree about the paperwork problem  My own views about health care are pretty libertarian  We need radical price transparency so that people are aware of the huge disparities in price between say  a blood test from Clinic A versus Clinic B  We need tort reform so that doctors don t live in mortal fear of being sued by patients  We need more than just gold  silver and bronze insurance options  Healthy young people should also be able to buy cut rate plans that cover only catastrophes  As for Medicare  the long term goal should be to get rid of it  That s obviously distinct from Medicaid  Even crazy right wingers like me believe that government has a moral duty to ensure that poor people have good access to quality medical care from womb to tomb Gail  Doctors do have to pay heavy insurance premiums to protect themselves from lawsuits  But patients also have to be protected from careless or inept physicians  It s tough to find a perfect solution   people have been trying for years  But fine by me if you want to work on it  Bret  I ll be cheering from the galleries Bret  The deeper problem with all of these health care debates is that we re discussing something that inevitably generates bad outcomes even under the best of circumstances  But can we switch subjects from tragedy to farce  I m curious to know your take on the Jussie Smollett story  which is what everyone I know was talking about last week  when they weren t talking about Mueller  Gail  You do have to thank the guy for taking Donald Trump off our minds  Not every day do you have a TV star making up a story of being attacked by MAGA hat wearing racist thugs  Everybody was stunned when the prosecutor dropped all the charges  She basically said  well  this is what we always do with first offenders who don t pose a threat to the community Not sure that would be true of first offenders whose self promoting lies and evasions cost the city six figures in overtime  But it s a good reminder that we have different criminal justice systems for the poor and the nonpoor Bret  I would not have minded if Smollett had gotten off relatively lightly   provided  that is  that he had admitted the charges  shown contrition and begged forgiveness  It s the arrogance and gall that bothers me  Kim Foxx  the Chicago prosecutor  says her office would have had a hard time securing a conviction  Was Smollett s check to the perpetrators and their confession of the crime not enough  The whole thing reeks of a corrupt bargain  and I hope the Department of Justice gets involved  Even Chicago can t afford Chicago style politics By the way  I don t want us to wrap up the conversation without complimenting you on your marvelous column about statues  specifically their scandalous dearth when it comes to honoring women  I m thrilled Billie Holiday will be getting one soon  in Queens  There are many more worthy would be honorees that I can think of  Gerty Cori was the first American woman to win a Nobel in science  Zora Neale Hurston ought to have one  too  if she doesn t already  And Dorothy Parker  provided the statue itself had a ribald sense of humor Who else should we be honoring Gail  Thanks  Bret  Right now  only five of the 150 public statues in New York are of women   we ve got dozens of ethically compromised politicians and run of the mill generals but we re only now working on Susan B  Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton Once we ve gotten the public figures taken care of  it d be nice to celebrate some low profile heroines  I was just reading about Esther Lewis  a widow who had a farm in Pennsylvania in the pre Civil War era  She ran a stop on the Underground Railroad that sheltered runaway slaves  discovered iron ore on her property and created a serious mining operation  educated her four daughters and churned nearly 300 pounds of butter a year  There s somebody I d like to see standing in a town square The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor

The future success of the Democratic Party depends on the crucial   but unsettled   allegiance of the nation s growing Hispanic electorate Fernand Amandi  a Democratic pollster and podcast host based in Miami  addressed the party s Latino quandary in a December interview with The Associated Press The question is not are Democrats winning the Hispanic vote   it s why aren t Democrats winning the Hispanic vote 80 20 or 90 10 the way they are winning black voters In an interview earlier this week  Amandi told me that Democrats  want and hope for this magical osmosis to happen but that s not how politics works  In the 2018 midterms  Democrats showed gains among Hispanic voters in most states  compared with 2014  Party operatives are concerned  however  about the slow rate of growth of these improved Democratic margins  They are equally worried about turnout   at a time when many thought that President Trump s rhetoric and policies would produce impressive gains among Latino voters for the Democratic Party Take turnout  Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic constituencies in the United States  but their level of political participation is not keeping pace with their overall population numbers As the accompanying Pew chart demonstrates  the number of Hispanic voters in midterm elections has grown steadily  from 2 9 million in 1986 to 6 8 million in 2014  At the same time  however  turnout   measured as a percentage of total eligible adult citizens 18 and over   has experienced a relative decline The Growth of the Latino Bloc       g edsall1 box  g artboard

  02           06           10           14         By The New York Times   Source  Pew Research CenterIn 1986  the Latino turnout rate was 38 7 percent  in 2014  that rate fell to 27 1 percent  If the 2014 turnout rate had been as high as it was in 1986  Hispanics would have cast 9 7 million ballots instead of 6 8 million   Complete numbers for 2018 are still being compiled  In a preliminary analysis of Hispanic voter turnout last year  Catalist  a Democratic firm that builds voter lists  found significant increases in turnout of three to five percent  comparing 2018 with the 2014 midterms  Texas  Nevada and California saw five percent increases  Florida four percent  New Mexico and New York three percent Turnout rates and levels of support are two key  but quite different  political measures  While Latinos had a turnout rate of 27 1 percent in 2014  their support for Democratic House candidates that year was 62 percent  Their support for Republican House candidates was 36 percent  according to exit polls While Democratic support among Hispanics has improved over the past decade  from the low 60s to the high 60s  there is evidence suggesting that those gains cannot be relied upon in future elections In the midterm elections  Florida became the prime example of such unreliability  as Republicans demonstrated they could buck state and national trends to make substantial gains among Hispanics Republicans won two close statewide races in Florida in 2018  one for senate and one for governor   despite the gradual erosion of Republican support among Cuban Americans in the state and despite the continuing influx of pro Democratic Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017 Simon Rosenberg  president of NDN  formerly the New Democrat Network  a pro Democratic think tank  wrote   In All Important Florida  Democrats Lose Ground With Hispanic Voters  a month after the 2018 election In an election where Democrats had one of their best years ever with Hispanic voters across the country  Florida Democrats saw their Hispanic numbers decline  Nationally  Democrats went from 62 36  26 pts  in 2014 to 69 29  40 pts  this election  In Florida  Democrats went from 58 38  20 pts  in 2014 to 54 44  10 pts  this year As Rosenberg pointed out  this shift occurred despite the fact that Trump did everything possible to alienate Latinos  along with undercutting Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis  the winning Republican candidates for Senate and governor Rosenberg noted that Trump hadrelentlessly attacked immigrants and Hispanics in particular  He grossly mismanaged the aftermath of Hurricane Maria  sending hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans fleeing to Central Florida  He revoked the temporary status of many immigrants in Florida  Given all this  one would have imagined the environment for Democrats to make gains among Hispanics was present in Florida this year  gains which were made elsewhere  Yet we fell back By all accounts  Scott and DeSantis campaigned almost daily in Hispanic precincts  while their Democratic opponents  Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum  took the Hispanic vote for granted  We had no infrastructure   Christian Ulvert  Gillum s director for Spanish language media  told Politico And honestly  Democrats have been playing catch up on Hispanic outreach for two decades  because Republicans have invested in it  You can t close that gap overnight Politico described Nelson s bid for a fourth term as  a uniquely lazy campaign that made laughably ineffectual attempts to engage with Hispanics  Melissa Michelson  a political scientist at Menlo College in California and president of the Latino caucus of the American Political Science Association  described in an email the changing political orientation of Florida s Cuban Americans In a 1989 90 survey  Michelson wrote  68 8 percent of Cuban Americans identified with Republicans  Since then there have been significant changes  Over the years  she continued  Pew has documented a steady decline in Cuban Americans  Republican identification  from 64 percent in 2002 to 56 percent in 2006 to 47 percent in 2013 Despite the decline in Republican support among Cuban Americans  Michelson emphasized thatThere has always been a contingent of Latinos who identify as Republican and are more interested in Republican conservative  or anti Communist  policies than in immigration issues or racism  Recall that 40 percent of Latinos voted for Bush in 2004  Reagan also enjoyed considerable Latino support  I think many Democrats are continually perplexed by this   that there could be Latino voters who are willing to support a president  or candidate  like Trump whose rhetoric and policies are so clearly anti Latino and racist While Scott and DeSantis revived Cuban American willingness to support Republicans  two of the three Florida House seats that had been represented by Cuban American Republicans switched parties in 2018 Revealing a contrast to Florida  Matt A  Barreto  a political scientist at U C L A  and a co founder of Latino Decisions  analyzed turnout and voting patterns in Texas  In a March report  Barreto described a huge pro Democratic turnout increase there  ranging from 105 to 125 percent in eight counties where Hispanics make up more than 90 percent of the population  There were significant gains in counties with white majorities of 83 to 91 percent too  but these upturns were smaller  in the 35 to 55 percent range The ability of two conservative Florida Republicans to make such inroads simply by campaigning diligently suggests that the Democratic hold on Latinos is less firm than many believed So where do Latinos stand politically The NBC News Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 918 Hispanics during 2018 and found that Trump s job approval rating was a relatively dismal 30 percent  21 points below his 51 percent favorability rating among whites  but 18 points higher than his 12 percent approval rate among African Americans The data  provided to The Times by Public Opinion Strategies  one of the two firms that conducted the survey  found that Trump s approval among Hispanics was highest among men and among the affluent   40 percent for both   and among men without college degrees  at 39 percent A 2018 Pew report   Key takeaways about Latino voters in the 2018 midterm elections   found that Hispanics cast a decisive majority of votes for Democratic congressional candidates  69 29   a smaller percentage of votes  however  than African Americans  90 9  and Asian Americans  77 23   Whites backed Republicans  54 to 44 In a state by state breakdown  Pew found that in the Texas Senate race  Latinos backed Democrat Beto O Rourke over Ted Cruz by nearly two to one  64 35  while Greg Abbott  the incumbent Republican governor  lost the Hispanic vote to Democratic challenger Lupe Valdez  53 42 In Florida  Democrats Gillum and Nelson won the Hispanic vote by nearly equal percentages  54 44 and 54 45    but in both cases by margins that were inadequate to produce overall victory The Democratic winner in the Nevada Senate race  Jacky Rosen  did far better among Hispanics  who backed her over Dean Heller  the Republican incumbent  67 30 While many Democrats expected Trump s anti immigrant rhetoric and policies  especially the family separation debacle  to produce a decisive shift to the left among Hispanics  that has not proved to be the case An October 2018 Pew report found that almosthalf of Latinos  48 percent  believe there is about the right amount of immigrants living in the U S   while a quarter say there are too many immigrants and 14 percent say there are too few  Three quarters of Hispanics opposed Trump s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border  while one in five favors construction In an email  Barreto  of Latino Decisions  argued that Democratic support among Hispanics remains solid I do not see anything since November 2018 to suggest Dems are losing any support at all  Trump continues on the same path of bashing immigrants and bashing Latinos without evidence and this only further decreases his favorability among Latinos Asked about the declining share of eligible Hispanics turning out on Election Day  Barreto countered that the growing numbers of eligible Latinos arealmost entirely driven by U S  born young Latinos turning 18 and entering the eligible voter pool In a common pattern  Barreto pointed out   young people have very low rates of voter registration and voter turnout   especially in midterm elections  Because of that  Barreto said that in order to get a better picture  the data should be age adjusted so that turnout levels of older voters of different races and ethnicities could be compared Barreto is also sharply critical of most polling of Hispanics and of exit polls in particular  arguing that the lack of Spanish speaking interviewers results in an undercount of Hispanic turnout as well as inaccurate estimates of Republican and Democratic votes In addition  candidates and political parties have to make a much stronger case to young Hispanics that their vote matters  according to Barreto Otherwise  you will only get incremental growth each year   which still puts Latinos as a larger and larger share of the electorate  but perhaps not as large as we could be Rosenberg  of NDN  argues that the Democratic Party did not start targeting the Hispanic electorate  with modern campaign tactics and communications  until the 2006 8 period  Those efforts immediately bore fruit  Rosenberg contended in an email Remember that in 2004 Bush won Arizona  Colorado  New Mexico and Nevada  Now Colorado and New Mexico are no longer really competitive at the presidential level  Nevada is slipping away from the Republicans  and Democrats elected a Senator in 2018 in Arizona Texas  according to Rosenberg   is about to hit a tipping point   in large part because of the Hispanic vote What conclusions and what questions remain in the wake of these complex and sometimes conflicting trends in the Hispanic electorate First and foremost  Latinos remain a decisively Democratic constituency  with important caveats Brian Schaffner  a political scientist at Tufts and co principal researcher at the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  wrote in an email that nationally  Hispanic support for Democrats has been relatively consistent Schaffner provided the accompanying graph  which shows the level of voting for Democrats in House contests in the six elections from 2008 to 2018 for whites  blacks  Asian Americans and Hispanics  The Hispanic Democratic vote shows a significant 8 6 point increase from 2014 to 2016 and a 13 6 point increase from 2014 to 2018   call it the Trump jump   although the increase in the percentage of Asian Americans voting for Democrats was even larger at 20 2 points Who Votes for DemocratsOf votes for the two major party candidates in House races  the share that went

Source  analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election Study by Brian Schaffner  Tufts UniversityLatinos  partisan loyalties are much less hard and fast than  say  those of either African Americans or white evangelicals  The results in Florida demonstrate that Democrats risk defeat if they fail to campaign heavily in Hispanic communities  and Republicans stand to gain at the margins if they are prepared to invest time  money and energy The major question mark going into 2020  assuming Trump is the Republican nominee  is whether Hispanic opposition to his presidency will prevent a recurrence of the Florida 2018 phenomenon  Will Trump s presence so nationalize the election that down ballot Republicans will face a brick wall when they try to make modest inroads among Hispanics To date  Trump has shown every intention of turning the election into a referendum on himself  and all the baggage he carries  with no regard for the political survival of fellow Republicans  If anything  he appears determined to drive up hostility to him among Latinos  For the past two days  for example  the president has ranted on Twitter  attacking Puerto Rico and its political leaders On Monday  he told his Twitter followers Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works On Tuesday  he was still at it All their local politicians do is complain   ask for more money  The pols are grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA Behaving this way  Trump may succeed in driving up support among  his people   as he likes to call his voters  But if he keeps it up  he will be doing both his Democratic opponent and the Democratic Party as a whole a huge favor as far as the Latino vote goes The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s
