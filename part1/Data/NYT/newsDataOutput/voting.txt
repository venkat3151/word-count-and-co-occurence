ISTANBUL ANKARA   President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party  AKP  will demand a new vote in Istanbul  a senior party official said on Tuesday after its bid was rejected for a citywide recount of March 31 election results that appeared to hand the party defeat  Initial results show the main opposition Republican People s Party  CHP  narrowly won control of Turkey s biggest city in the mayoral elections  seemingly bringing an end to the 25 year rule there by the AKP and its Islamist predecessors Since the vote  the AKP has filed a series of requests for recounts in the city  Overnight  the High Election Board  YSK  rejected a request to recount all votes across 31 of Istanbul s districts  the party s representative at the YSK said The YSK agreed only to a recount of 51 ballot boxes  spread across 21 of the city s total 39 districts  but the AKP called this decision  unfathomable  Speaking to reporters in Istanbul  AKP Deputy Chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said his party would file an extraordinary appeal to the YSK for a fresh vote in Istanbul over what he said were irregularities that directly impacted the outcome  We will file our extraordinary appeal today  We will say that there have been events that directly impacted the outcome of the elections and that we demand the renewal of the elections in Istanbul   Yavuz said  He later tweeted that the appeal could happen  in coming days  He said if the YSK rejected the party s appeal to renew the votes  doubt over the elections would remain until the next mayoral elections are due in five years Erdogan said on Monday the local elections were marred by  organized crime  at ballot boxes in Istanbul  raising the possibility of re running the vote in the city of some 15 million residents  Erdogan s comments  his strongest challenge yet to the election process in Istanbul  briefly drove the lira down and also weighed on Turkish stocks  The lira was steady at 5 6850 to the dollar on Tuesday In Istanbul  CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu called on the YSK to finalize the election results as soon as possible and said the AKP was to blame for the uncertainty surrounding the vote  If they re looking for the perpetrators  they should look in the mirror  Look in the mirror if you want to see who is responsible for this   he said  SORE LOSERS The loss in Istanbul  if confirmed  would be a setback for Erdogan s efforts to pull Turkey out of recession  He has dominated Turkish politics for more than 16 years on the back of stellar economic growth To justify its calls for recounts and for a full re run of the elections  the AKP said there were illegal appointments of representatives at ballot boxes and irregularities across the city The CHP said the AKP s appeals were unlawful  You are complaining and appealing nonstop  and this shows one of two things  Either you are so incompetent that you can t even get an election right  or you are such sore losers that you can t accept defeat   CHP spokesman Faik Oztrak said The YSK s decision on the AKP s appeal for a fresh vote in Istanbul will be final  If rejected  the ongoing recounts across the city will be completed and the results finalised If the appeal is accepted  the re run of elections in Istanbul would be held on the first Sunday 60 days after the initial elections  which would be June 2 Erdogan s party also lost the mayoralty in the capital Ankara to CHP candidate Mansur Yavas despite seeking recounts across the city  Yavas received his mandate on Monday after the YSK upheld the initial results Erdogan said the scale of irregularities his party had uncovered meant the margin of votes between Istanbul s top two candidates  currently at less than 15 000 in a city of 10 million voters  was too narrow for the opposition to claim victory However  his AKP candidate and former prime minister Binali Yildirim had declared victory by some 3 000 votes in Istanbul on election night  before conceding that Imamoglu held a lead   Additional reporting by Ali Kucukgocmen and Ece Toksabay  Writing by Daren Butler and Tuvan Gumrukcu  Editing by Jonathan Spicer  Catherine Evans and Frances Kerry

ANKARA   President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party is seeking a full recount of all votes cast in local elections in Istanbul  a senior party official said on Sunday  a week after initial results showed a narrow victory for Turkey s main opposition party The AKP is reeling from its apparent loss of the mayoralties of Istanbul and the capital Ankara  both cities which the party and its Islamist predecessors have dominated for a quarter of a century  Erdogan himself rose to prominence as Istanbul s mayor in the 1990s before emerging as national leader His party has already appealed the initial results in all 39 districts of the city of 15 million people  leading to partial or full recounts across Turkey s largest city So far the initial lead held by Ekrem Imamoglu  mayoral candidate for the secularist Republican People s Party  CHP   has narrowed from 25 000 immediately after the vote to a little over 16 000 after 70 percent of the recounts were completed With both Imamoglu and his rival  former prime minister Binali Yildirim  securing more than 4 1 million votes  the margin of victory is likely to be extremely slim  but Imamoglu has said the appeals and recounts will not change the outcome  AKP deputy party chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said there was  organised misconduct  in the original count  and the party will appeal to the High Election Body  YSK   the final arbiter on electoral disputes  for all Istanbul votes to be recounted  We chose the path to eliminate numerical mistakes  But it s not over   he told reporters in televised comments on Sunday PAINFUL LOSSThe losses in Ankara and Istanbul  if confirmed  would be especially painful for Erdogan  who campaigned relentlessly for the local elections For most of his 16 years in power he has overseen strong economic growth  largely supported by a construction boom funded with cheap debt  which has won backing for the AKP beyond its base of pious  conservative Turks  But sharp falls in the lira have tipped the economy into recession  eroding some support in the buildup to the vote Erdogan s party  which together with its nationalist MHP ally won more than 51 percent of the countrywide vote for local offices on March 31  says its overall performance was a victory  But that is scant compensation for losing the main cities Spokesman Omer Celik said on Saturday the party would accept the final verdict of the YSK   Whoever is declared winner by High Election Board  we will accept that   he told reporters Speaking shortly after Yavuz announced the AKP s latest appeal  Imamoglu said it was time for the party to accept defeat  He also promised  to reconcile this city  and to work closely with the president   I understand the feeling of defeat of the people who demanded a recount   Imamoglu said   You managed this city for 25 years  It is not easy  you lost  But democracy is like that   democracy is not a one way path    Editing by Dominic Evans and Peter Graff

TOKYO   Nissan shareholders voted on Monday to remove Carlos Ghosn from the company s board  severing one of its last ties to an executive who once was hailed as the automaker s savior Mr  Ghosn  Nissan s longtime chairman  who helped pull the company out of a deep slump nearly 20 years ago  is now in a Tokyo jail  where he faces four charges ranging from underreporting his executive compensation to  aggravated breach of trust  He was released on bail in early March  but Japanese prosecutors rearrested him late last week  accusing him of using a Nissan subsidiary to enrich himself to the tune of  5 million  Mr  Ghosn and a close associate  Greg Kelly  who was charged with helping him underreport his compensation  have denied all wrongdoing Nissan removed Mr  Ghosn from his position as chairman in November  shortly after he was arrested  but the board could not remove him as a director until Monday s special meeting Nissan s chief executive  Hiroto Saikawa  and the board of directors began the session with an apology and a deep bow to the assembled shareholders Nissan s top management  is in a state of soul searching   Mr  Saikawa said   We have to admit that there was a significant problem with our corporate governance   I have been asking myself over and over why the organization failed to stop the misconduct   he said   The reasons  I believe  were the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual for a long time  The audience was not in a forgiving mood  During a question and answer session  shareholders launched a salvo at board members  One person called for the entire group to resign to make amends for fumbling its responsibilities to the company  The suggestion was met with applause and hoots of approval from the assembly Mr  Saikawa responded by apologizing again   The board and executive committee members are dedicating their efforts towards the present and future of Nissan   he said  adding   I would like to ask for your support  Shareholders voted to replace Mr  Ghosn with Renault s new chairman  Jean Dominique Senard  He will assume the role of vice chairman on Nissan s board They also removed Mr  Kelly  who is free on bail in Tokyo  from his seat on the board Mr  Ghosn s sudden fall plunged the auto making alliance of Nissan and Renault into chaos  Mr  Ghosn led both companies and the alliance itself  and his arrest added tension to a relationship that already had begun to fray as Nissan struggled to assert independence from Renault But in recent weeks  the group  which includes the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi  has pledged to redouble its efforts to work together Renault is eager to move on and focus on the future business of the alliance  Tensions had blown up between it and Nissan after Mr  Ghosn s arrest  as Nissan leaked allegations of his wrongdoing into the media  Renault and the French government  its biggest shareholder  responded bitterly and maintained a presumption of innocence toward Mr  Ghosn But in recent months  Renault s own internal investigations began to turn up questionable use of company funds by Mr  Ghosn  These included a lavish Marie Antoinette themed wedding party at Versailles  and payments to a Renault Nissan business partner in Oman that are suspected of being used to help finance Mr  Ghosn s yacht  Renault referred both findings to French prosecutors In March  the companies announced the formation of a new operating board for the alliance  after discussions at Nissan s headquarters in Yokohama aimed at creating a new path forward for the three automakers  with a greater voice for the junior Japanese partners  The board includes two representatives from Renault and one each from Nissan and Mitsubishi Still  questions surrounding the imbalance in the alliance s ownership structure remain  While Renault has argued that closer ties would help the companies work better together and share costs  some Nissan executives remain concerned that Renault  which holds a 43 percent stake in the Japanese automaker  would still wield greater power  Nissan owns a 15 percent nonvoting stake in the French automaker Executives at both companies have said that the issue is one to be addressed in the future But it was clearly on the mind of at least one shareholder at Monday s meeting  who criticized Renault s role in making business decisions at Nissan  Does Renault  a French company  really know the Japanese market   he asked the board   Does it really understand Nissan s technology   I have my doubts   

An Israeli public relations firm aligned with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud party said it was behind the placement of some 1 200 cameras in predominantly Arab polling stations  and claimed the tactic helped lower Arab voter turnout in the election Tuesday The company  Kaizler Inbar  said in a  Facebook post on Wednesday that it had worked with Likud not only to distribute the cameras but also to deploy more than 1 300 activists to polling stations Arab voter turnout was just over 50 percent  a historically low level  Israeli news outlets reported  But that most likely resulted from several factors  analysts said  including a boycott of the vote by some Arabs over the passage of laws seen as discriminatory and a lack of robust representation On Wednesday  Mr  Netanyahu was in position to take a fourth consecutive term in office  with nearly all of the votes counted and the rival Blue and White alliance having conceded the race Likud claimed that it used the cameras  some of which were concealed  to record evidence of potential voter fraud  The Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint on Tuesday over the use of the cameras  calling it a voter intimidation tactic The Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said the action was prohibited  and the police confiscated dozens of the cameras Kaizler Inbar played off the committee s ruling on Wednesday  writing in its Facebook post   Shhhh     Don t tell anyone  It was us  After a  long period of preparations  and a  tight partnership with the best of people in Likud   the company wrote  it made a contribution to  the most important accomplishments of the right wing bloc  Kaizler Inbar is headed by Sagi Kaizler  a former leader of a West Bank settler group  The organization claimed it sent some 1 350 people to Arab polling stations Afif Abu Much  37  a computer engineer and political activist from Baqa al Gharbiyye  a town bordering the West Bank  said he was not surprised by Likud s decision to deploy the cameras  It is part of our prime minister s campaign of repression against Arab citizens in Israel   he said  Among other things  he cited the passage of a law last summer that declared Israel the  nation state of the Jewish people  Mr  Abu Much said Mr  Netanyahu would have been hurt by a large Arab turnout  an assessment shared by analysts   To beat Netanyahu  you need Arabs   he said   Without the Arabs  you cannot send Netanyahu home  He knows that  But Mr  Abu Much wasn t convinced that the cameras were the driving reason for the low Arab turnout  He noted that the Blue and White alliance  seen as the main threat to Likud  had done little to appeal to Arab voters or align itself with Arab parties  

BARCELONA   A Barcelona court on Tuesday charged 30 people with misuse of public funds over Catalonia s 2017 independence referendum  a move that may worsen tensions between the region and Spain s central government ahead of a nationwide election on April 28 Catalonia s stance is important as many polls suggest that Spain s governing Socialists may need the backing of Catalan pro independence parties to form a majority in Madrid  The biggest issue in campaigning for the April 28 vote has been Madrid s handling of Catalan discontent that led to the 2017 plebiscite and an ultimately abortive attempt to secede from Spain  with right of center parties calling for tougher action against the Catalan government in Barcelona In a separate trial that has been criticized by international rights groups  12 Catalan pro independence leaders face charges including rebellion and misappropriation of funds that could  if convicted  see them face decades in prison  The trial was a big factor in Catalan pro independence parties withholding support for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez s 2019 budget earlier this year  depriving him of votes needed to pass the plan and triggering an early national election The defendants in Tuesday s court session include aides to leading politicians in Catalonia s former pro independence government  They face charges including misappropriation of funds and falsifying documents  Graver charges of rebellion and sedition  faced by the 12 now on trial  were not included  The Barcelona court set joint bail at 5 8 million euros   6 5 million  in total for 17 of the accused  an amount equal to the public funds allegedly misappropriated for the organization of the referendum  a court writ said Catalan pro independence leader Quim Torra  speaking in a televised address on Tuesday  condemned the fresh charges   This  authoritarian stand confirms an absence of judicial independence and political persecution   he said in a statement  and added that Catalonia s independence quest would continue  No date was immediately set for the trial    Reporting by Sam Edwards  Editing by Mark Heinrich

Trying to reverse a stinging setback  Turkey s ruling party on Tuesday demanded a redo of last week s election for mayor of Istanbul  the country s largest city and long a source of power and prestige for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan The extraordinary stance came as it became increasingly clear that a days long recounting of ballots would not change the result that Binali Yildirim  the candidate of Mr  Erdogan s Justice and Development Party  known as the A K P   had lost to the opposition candidate  Ekrem Imamoglu  in the March 31 election  Mr  Erdogan s party had already demanded a recount of spoiled ballots in all of Istanbul and a full recount in some of the city s districts  When that did not change the result  it called for a recount of the entire Istanbul vote  which the High Election Council refused The latest demand now puts the High Election Council squarely on the spot and threatens to precipitate a crisis for both Istanbul and the entire country  becoming the latest test of democratic institutions already groaning under the authoritarian strains of Mr  Erdogan s 16 years in power  I find the chances extremely high that the election board will accept A K P  s request to repeat the elections    said Soner Cagaptay  director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy   Far from being independent  the election board  like other institutions  has fallen under Erdogan s power  and I would say the board has thus far taken steps to facilitate Erdogan s each and every next move    he added He noted that the council had already allowed a recount of invalid ballots  even though the A K P  presented no credible evidence  other than a narrow margin  that there had been irregularities That has not stopped the party or the president from alleging that the irregularities were systemic in Istanbul  where the candidates are separated by less than 0 3 percent of almost nine million votes cast  We will use the extraordinary appeal grounds and say we want to renew the elections in Istanbul   Ali Ihsan Yavuz  the deputy head of the party  said at a televised news conference in Ankara  the capital   Everywhere in Istanbul  organized acts were done  That is why we called it organized irregularity  Mr  Erdogan himself has cast doubt on the election and pressed the case for a do over by citing examples of American elections where the margin was so narrow that the balloting was redone  Irregularities are not just a few  almost entirely it is irregular   he said on Monday of the election in Istanbul  speaking at Ataturk Airport before leaving for a visit to Moscow Murat Yetkin  formerly the editor in chief of Hurriyet Daily News  wrote on his blog this week that even those in the president s circle were divided about how far to push the challenge  with a small  determined group urging the president to  put his weight for renewing Istanbul elections  A second  larger group of more experienced politicians have argued to accept the results  because the challenge is actually benefiting Mr  Imamoglu by elevating his stature Judging by Mr  Erdogan s statement this week  the hard liners may be carrying the day  though it may also be a way for the president   to manage the trauma    said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli  the Ankara director of German Marshall Fund ImageInitial results said that Ekrem Imamoglu  center  the candidate of the opposition Republican People s Party  had won the March 31 election CreditOzan Kose Agence France Presse   Getty Images  This looks like more to redefine the defeat in Istanbul as if it was actually won but stolen by illegitimate means    said Mr  Unluhisarcikli  who noted that a new election would actually be quite risky for the president as the economy continues to deteriorate  I do not believe that Erdogan actually wants to renew the elections    Mr  Unluhisarcikli said    The economic realities do not allow this  It would be a huge gamble   The result in Istanbul carries enormous weight  however  and there are clear incentives for the president and his party to fight a loss With 15 million people  most of them on the European side of the Bosporus  Istanbul is the most populous city on the Continent and Turkey s economic capital  It is also Mr  Erdogan s hometown and has long been a base of support for him Just as important  the opposition and some analysts say  the city has become a vital source of wealth in a network of cronyism and nepotism that has benefited from the awarding of municipal contracts and the distribution of city funds to charitable foundations with links to the president s family Even before he has been officially declared the winner  Mr  Imamoglu  who ran for the opposition Republican People s Party  has vowed to open the books of the city  which Mr  Erdogan and his party have controlled since 2002  to expose long simmering accusations of corruption  The result of this election is clear    Mr  Imamoglu said at a televised news conference on Tuesday  when he repeated his desire to take office and start working immediately    The streets accepted the result  You can work hard  and win five years later  We have won  admit it  Last week  Mr  Imamoglu said that with its continuing challenges to the result of the election  Mr  Erdogan s party was stalling for time so that it could erase City Hall records from computers before independent auditors could carry out the review he promises Such allegations have taken on more weight with voters as the Turkish economy falters  undercutting the president s long record of nearly unbroken economic growth  Turkey entered recession this year  and the currency  the lira  has continued to slide amid increasing worry by investors and markets The opposition party also won a close mayoral election in Ankara  a result that the election council has finalized  The potential loss of Istanbul would place both the country s political and financial capitals in opposition hands Taken together with rest of the results from the March 31 elections  the balloting reflected increasing discontent among voters with Mr  Erdogan  who has concentrated executive powers  carried out a sweeping purge of opponents after a failed 2016 coup  and brought a once vibrant news media to heel The High Election Council must consider the request by Mr  Erdogan s party for a new election  but the opposition party insisted that the result was legitimate and clear  Both legally and conscientiously  there is no obstacle to giving Ekrem Imamoglu his mayoral certificate   Faik Oztrak  the opposition spokesman  said in televised remarks   Mr  Imamoglu is right now the elected mayor of Istanbul  as he was on the morning of April 1  He pointed out that Mr  Erdogan s A K P  party had won many districts in Istanbul as well as other towns across the country  results that were not being challenged  So when A K P  mayors are elected it is the national will  but when the votes go to Imamoglu  it is dubious    Mr  Oztrak said    Even crows laugh at that  They should leave the nation alone   

JAKARTA    Mama  just killed a man   sings Indonesian President Joko Widodo during a recent ride in a local YouTube celebrity s car while Queen s Bohemian Rhapsody plays in the background  The video  which also shows Widodo dressed in a red zip up jacket and jeans chatting about family life and the pressures of running the world s third largest democracy  was the brainchild of a backroom team that has become a vital part of his campaign for re election on April 17  The team  comprised mainly of people in their 20s  has a sleek  high rise office in central Jakarta  On a recent visit  Reuters saw the team s data of social media activity on the Indonesian presidential election displayed on LED screens covering one wall of a conference room Widodo s aides say the team uses the data to determine the pop culture references that the president will make in his next speech   he s done  Games of Thrones  and the  Avengers  already   or the sneakers he might wear to an event to appeal to young voters  Widodo s sons also sometimes advise him on outfits or speeches  according to one senior campaign aide Millennials   those aged 17 35   account for over one third of Indonesia s 193 million voters and both Widodo and his challenger  former general Prabowo Subianto  have ramped up efforts to appeal to them  Just because of the sheer size of that voter base  the millennials will play an important role in deciding the direction of the election   said Djayadi Hanan of pollster Saiful Mujani Research   Consulting  Most opinion polls show Widodo  57  holding a double digit lead over his opponent  A recent survey by pollster Roy Morgan showed around 60 percent of young voters favoring Widodo  but both campaigns say that wooing the country s largely apolitical youth is a challenge  A former furniture maker who grew up in a riverside slum and is the first national leader to come from outside the political and military elite  Widodo s everyman image resonated in 2014 with voters tired of the old guard  But since taking office  aides say  young supporters  no longer recognized  the president and he was advised to project a more relaxed image  Because he has had to become more stately  that  village boy  narrative was missing this time   said the senior campaign aide  who declined to be identified That s where the backroom team came in  We re able to see in real time what does well or what people react negatively to     We were very blunt in conveying that to the president   the aide said  adding that Widodo gets a summary of the social media data almost daily JEANS

animated comic strip on social media that showed him meeting his younger self and discussing the achievements of his government Taking a page from Indian Prime Minister s Narendra Modi s playbook  Widodo has started using a holographic projection of himself to address voters at campaign rallies  Analysts say Prabowo is less popular among young voters  in part because of a strongman image stemming from his time as special forces chief under authoritarian ruler Suharto  Aides have suggested softening the image of the 67 year old  so he now wears a khaki shirt and aviator sunglasses at campaign rallies   It was rare to see his lighter side and sense of humor  We have tried to expose that side of him   said campaign spokesman Dahnil Anzar Prabowo s team has also posted a photograph of him with his cat  which was popular online  The cat now has its own Instagram account Prabowo s running mate  businessman and amateur marathon runner Sandiaga Uno  was chosen in part for his massive appeal both online and offline with young and female voters  As the keynote speaker at a recent event for young entrepreneurs  Uno  49  joined a group of breakdancers on stage before kicking

ISTANBUL ANKARA   Election officials expanded a vote recount in Istanbul late on Thursday  CNN Turk said  as the ruling party of President Tayyip Erdogan pushed its appeal against its shock defeat there in local elections Erdogan s AK Party said it would also demand a wider check on votes across the capital Ankara   which initial results suggested it also narrowly lost in Sunday s vote in a major blow to the establishment Those losses  if confirmed  would be particularly painful for Erdogan  whose party and its predecessor have dominated the two cities for 25 years  He launched his political career in Istanbul and served as the city s mayor in the 1990s On Wednesday  Turkey s High Election Board had ordered a full recount in three of Istanbul s 39 districts and a recount of just invalid ballots in 15 districts after an appeal from Erdogan s AKP Late on Thursday the board decided there would be a full recount in those 15 districts as well  CNN Turk said  Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul  Ekrem Imamoglu  told Reuters it looked like his lead had narrowed to around 19 500 votes from an earlier 25 000 as the recount progressed  but he was sure he would still become mayor  The results will not change  Time is passing and Istanbul is waiting for service  so we just want to get to our job as soon as possible   said Imamoglu of the Republican People s Party  CHP   The mathematics and numbers are clear   Imamoglu told Reuters   There is no need to think of a Plan B right now  Imamoglu later said on Twitter that recounts in Istanbul s 14 districts  where there were a total of 89 255 invalid votes  had been completed  and added that he was 18 871 votes ahead of his rival The AKP s representative on the election board  Recep Ozel  told broadcaster A Haber earlier on Thursday that the difference in Istanbul would keep falling and his candidate  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  would emerge the winner in Turkey s commercial hub Speaking at a news conference in Ankara  AKP spokesman Omer Celik said the steps taken for recounts were not extraordinary  All citizens should remain calm  Our democracy is showing its strength as it always has   Celik said   Let the law work and let s respect the outcome  RECESSION CHALLENGEAhead of the elections  the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival the alliance between the AKP and their nationalist MHP partners  They named joint candidates in certain cities  including Ankara and Istanbul In Ankara  opposition candidate Mansur Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes on Sunday to earn a nearly 4 percentage point victory over his AKP rival  former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki  The AKP also appealed against those results  prompting the election board to order a recount in 11 of the city s districts But AKP Secretary General Fatih Sahin said on Thursday that the results of the recount so far were  far from meeting our expectations  and the party would appeal for another recount across the city If the initial results are confirmed  the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32 6 billion liras   5 79 billion  for 2019 in Istanbul and Ankara Erdogan would likely also lose some oversight for municipal contracts in the two cities  possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession In another sign of public backlash  the AKP MHP alliance also lost control of the southern coastal cities of Antalya  Mersin and Adana  the central provinces of Bolu and Kirsehir  and the eastern cities of Artvin  Igdir and Ardahan The CHP has said that Kurdish votes coming from the pro Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party  HDP  had helped them win narrow victories in key provinces  after the HDP chose not to name candidates in some cities and back the opposition instead  Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics since coming to power 16 years ago and ruled his country with an ever tighter grip  campaigned relentlessly for two months ahead of Sunday s vote  which he described as a  matter of survival  for Turkey In some 100 rallies during his election campaign  Erdogan described the opposition as terrorist supporters and said his central government could not provide services if it wasn t in harmony with local administrations But the president s efforts came up against widespread anger about Turkey s recession  which has brought surging inflation and unemployment  and caused the lira to plunge Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to volatility in the currency  which sold off sharply nearly two weeks ago  reflecting waning confidence among both Turks and international investors  It closed at 5 63 to the dollar on Thursday   Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay in Ankara and Yesim Dikmen in Istanbul  Editing by Jonathan Spicer  Andrew Heavens and James Dalgleish

AYODHYA  India   Priyanka Gandhi Vadra became the latest member of India s storied Nehru Gandhi dynasty to enter politics in January  but the boost she brings the opposition campaign may not turn the tide against Prime Minister Narendra Modi  polls show After years of speculation  the charismatic Vadra joined Congress to help its leader  her brother Rahul  in general elections that begin next week  pitching the party and regional groups against Modi s Hindu nationalist led alliance Congress hopes the fourth generation siblings of a dynasty that ruled India for decades after independence from Britain in 1947 and is still revered by many will help energize its ranks and counter Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  In the run up to the election that starts on Thursday  the 47 year old Vadra has spent hours campaigning in cars  trucks and even a boat  to woo voters in northern Uttar Pradesh  which sends more lawmakers to parliament than any other Indian state Reuters followed her at two roadshows where she smiled  waved  and shook hands  occasionally wading into crowds as her security detail scrambled along  Her father and grandmother  both former prime ministers  were assassinated Thousands of people lined the streets for several kilometers  waving Congress flags and chanting her name   There is support for Congress because of Priyanka   said Mahesh Gupta  a shopkeeper in the temple town of Ayodhya  where she visited a shrine in late March Gupta  who referred to Vadra by her first name  as many Indians do  voted for Modi in the last election  but said he was considering Congress after seeing her campaign Ayodhya is at the heart of decades of tension between Hindus and minority Muslims  as Hindu groups led by the BJP have campaigned for a temple to the god king Rama to be built on the site of a mosque razed to the ground by Hindu zealots in 1992 Vadra  a marquee campaigner for Congress  chose Ayodhya as one of her first tours to take on the BJP in its own bastion Even so  in the face of the formidable political machine of the BJP which also rules the state  Congress may be unable to capitalize on her appeal  pollsters and some party leaders said Vadra s campaigning was getting attention for Congress it would not have got otherwise  but it did not look like the party was making gains  said Milan Vaishnav  an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  Many in Congress say the Priyanka play is more about building up the party for 2022 assembly elections and beyond   he said  referring to state elections in Uttar Pradesh Last month  polling agencies CVoter and CNX separately estimated Congress would win just 4 of the 80 seats up for grabs in the state  doubling its tally since the last general election in 2014 That year s sweep of 71 seats for the BJP paved the way for Modi s clear majority in India s 545 member lower house of parliament A broader poll published by the Hindu newspaper on Friday showed Modi s approval ratings across India were higher even than in 2014  when he was making a bid for power  The poll  by the Hindu CSDS Lokniti  showed 43 percent of respondents wanted Modi as the next prime minister  with 24 percent for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi VOTE WISELYFor years  Vadra helped manage elections for her brother and mother  former Congress president Sonia Gandhi  in their own constituencies  but was reluctant to get into politics herself  A mother of two  she is married to businessman Robert Vadra  and has long been seen as a natural politician with strong speaking skills and an ability to easily connect with people One afternoon last week  her 12 car convoy sped past lush fields and small settlements  kicking up a cloud of dust before stopping at the village of Atka in the Ayodhya district The saree clad Vadra jumped out of her car and settled down on the ground surrounded by a group of women  many veiled and others smiling   If someone doesn t work for you  how will you teach them a lesson   she asked  imploring them to vote wisely   Vote for those who want to work for you  CVoter  which has run a daily opinion poll since January  said Congress support in Uttar Pradesh has dropped off after jumping 10 percentage points in the days following the news that Vadra had taken a party post  Late in March  about 8 9 percent of state voters backed Congress  a far cry from the 43 4 percent supporting the BJP and the 44 percent behind an alliance of two major regional parties However  even with Vadra s hectic campaigning  Congress is struggling to get its message of welfare to voters  party officials said  Six voters in Uttar Pradesh said they had not heard of a Congress election promise for a program to give India s poorest families monthly handouts of 6 000 rupees  They brought her in at a very wrong time   said one Congress official  who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak formally to media  A better time would have been December  just days after Congress won power in three key states  giving her more time to prepare  he added  Others in the party have said it should have been years earlier The BJP has dismissed Vadra s formal entry into politics as inconsequential and Modi said it only showed that for some  the family is the party   Vadra s office did not respond to a request from Reuters for an interview  But Congress will seize on momentum building against the BJP  said Kamal Nath  a top Congress leader and chief minister of the central state of Madhya Pradesh   You have to time everything   he told Reuters   You don t want to peak out too fast    Additional reporting by Nidhi Verma  Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Clarence Fernandez

ROME   Italy s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday he would host a major rally of European nationalist and far right parties to promote a shared political vision ahead of May s EU parliamentary elections Salvini leads the ruling League party and hopes to put together a bloc of like minded  anti immigration parties in the European parliament to challenge the traditionally predominant and mainstream center left and center right groups However he has so far struggled to create a broad  sovereignist front in the 28 nation European Union  with a matrix of conflicting national interests hindering his progress With time running out  he announced this week he would kick off his campaign for the May 26 vote in Milan on Monday with representatives of just three  relatively small far right European parties  But speaking after talks with his longtime French ally Marine Le Pen  Salvini told reporters he planned a much more ambitious election rally next month  We re preparing a major event for the Europe of the next 30 years in May in Italy  where we ll invite all the European movements that are alternatives to the rule of the Socialists and the European People s Party of recent years   Salvini said  referring to the EU s big leftist and conservative groups  It will be the first time an event drawing together at least 15 or 20 European countries will take place in Italy   he told reporters in Paris Salvini did not say what other parties had signed up to the initiative  which the League hopes to hold in Rome s ancient chariot racing stadium Circus Maximus DIVERGENCEEuropean parties have created multiple  pan national groups in the EU parliament  with the League a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom  ENF   which includes Le Pen s National Rally and Austria s Freedom Party of Austria  Salvini wants to embrace other far right or nationalist leaders whose parties are in different groups  such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski  the head of Poland s ruling PiS party Kaczynski met Salvini in January  but PiS  which is highly suspicious of the close ties Le Pen and Salvini have forged with Moscow  said on Friday it would not join the May rally  We met  Salvini  a few weeks ago and we spelt out our conditions when it comes to the European parliament  We do not envisage any further contact until after the election   said Tomasz Poreba  PiS s EU ballot campaign chief Making clear its preferences  PiS this week welcomed Salvini s old ally  the Brothers of Italy  into its EU group    the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe  We are the real sovereignists  They are populists   Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni told La Stampa newspaper on Thursday  referring to the League   I don t think Salvini s project is very clear about what it wants with Europe  Salvini said the three groups that would be joining him on Monday were the anti euro Alternative for Germany  AfD  party  the conservative Finns Party and the Danish People s Party AfD co leader Joerg Meuthen told La Stampa newspaper on Friday that although he and Salvini had similar  anti immigrant views  they had different positions on key economic questions  like the need to respect EU fiscal rules  We cannot agree on everything  We will talk about it and find compromises   he was quoted as saying   Additional reporting by Gavin Jones in Rome  Michel Rose and Simon Carraud in Paris and Pawel Florkiewicz in Warsaw  Editing by William Maclean  

JERUSALEM   Frustrated over their choices in the Israeli election  and at Arab politicians whom they describe as ineffective  some Palestinian citizens of Israel have been gathering popular support for a boycott of Tuesday s ballot But a well known Palestinian hip hop artist released a powerful new video on Thursday pushing back on the boycott  urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes   and expressing hope that a strong turnout on Tuesday could help send Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu packing  or even  to prison  Tamer Must Vote    <U+062A><U+0627><U+0645><U+0631>

Arabic language video  which spread widely on social media and has sparked a robust online debate  the rapper  Tamer Nafar of Lod  Israel  argues with himself over whether to vote or stay home  then comes down strongly in favor of voting   dramatizing what Mr  Nafar said had been his own internal dialogue over the past few weeks  It s our land  but their state   the voice of the pro boycott Mr  Nafar says in the video  which is titled  Tamer Must Vote  in English  adding of the Israeli Parliament   The Knesset s not for me  ImageIsraeli border police officers standing guard next to posters depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditOded Balilty Associated PressBut the Mr  Nafar who favors voting retorts that even the shekel is Israeli  What then   throw away our money  and drop out of the economy  since the taxes paid by Arab citizens fund the army   Plant tea leaves at home so we won t fund missiles on Gaza   They re using us to look liberal   the pro boycotter says  echoing a frequent argument of Palestinian citizens who say that participating in Israeli democracy provides a veneer of equality in Western eyes  Yeah  baby  democracy is so  80s   the pro voter says sarcastically His vote wouldn t change anything  the pro boycotter responds  It s like stepping  into a missile war when all I got is a knife   or fighting a tank  when all I got is a stone  The pro voter hits back by acknowledging  it doesn t mean that we ll liberate Palestine   but says  dropping the mic  that  if our vote will erase Lieberman  imprison Bibi  then we re ready   referring to the former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman Indeed  one of the richest ironies that could emerge from Tuesday s election would be if strong Arab turnout raised the minimum vote threshold for political parties to gain entry into Parliament so high that Mr  Lieberman failed to clear it  His party  Yisrael Beiteinu  is struggling in the polls  Read about how Prime Minister Netanyahu s anti Arab provocations may backfire this time around  though they may have helped him in the past  It was Mr  Lieberman who pushed a change in the election law that raised the voting percentage threshold in 2015  as a way of banning Arab parties from the Knesset  The Arab parties responded at the time by joining forces  and their Joint List won a record 13 seats in the Knesset that year Some polls this year indicated turnout among Palestinian citizens would be even higher  given widespread anger at Mr  Netanyahu  who has been running an exceptionally anti Arab campaign  But the boycott movement is having the reverse effect  exasperating Arab leaders as well as many Jewish Israeli opponents of Mr  Netanyahu who hoped that Arab voters could play a decisive role in defeating him In an interview  Mr  Nafar said he was still hoping for such a result  which he said would be  poetic justice   Read our guide to the Israeli elections  He said that he was not enamored of Benny Gantz  the former army chief who is neck and neck with Mr  Netanyahu in the polls  but that Mr  Gantz would be preferable to Mr  Netanyahu  And although Mr  Netanyahu is facing indictment only on corruption charges  Mr  Nafar said   he would prefer it be for  war crimes     At least it s something   he added ImageBenny Gantz  leader of the Blue and White party  during an election campaign event in Ashkelon on Wednesday CreditAmir Cohen Reuters I guess I m watching too much  Game of Thrones    he said Mr  Nafar  39  began his hip hop career in the late 1990s  and his lyrics took a strong political turn with the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada  in 2000  The son of Palestinian refugees and a father of two  he was the star of a celebrated autobiographical film   Junction 48   in 2016  The Israeli culture minister  Miri Regev  walked out on his performance at the country s movie awards ceremony that year and has tried to have his performances canceled  I m not saying that being in the Knesset is the best medicine  but if I want to let go of it I should do that dose by dose   he said  explaining his decision to vote   not all at once  with nothing in its place In the video  Mr  Nafar s pro boycott persona has little use for Arab politicians   Did they deal with poverty  Did they bring us schools and jobs   he asks   We only see them out there during elections   He adds that he voted for the Joint List the last time  but infighting broke it apart   For me  this ship has sunk   he says Yet Mr  Nafar s pro vote voice says that rather than the Titanic  he sees Arab politicians as the Mavi Marmara   the protest ship that tried to defy the Israeli blockade of Gaza in 2010  gaining international attention for the Palestinian cause   It doesn t make sense for me to give up a tool  when I hardly have any tools  so I m going to vote   he says The alternative  Mr  Nafar said in the interview  would be to allow Israeli leaders to do whatever they wanted to Palestinian citizens   even if  as some extremist right wing politicians would like  that meant transferring Arab citizens out of Israel Voting  Mr  Nafar s alter ego says in the video  was at least one thing he has the power to do to ensure  that I can sing to the boycotters  rather than talk to them in the transfer trucks   

VALLDEMOSSA  Spain   Majorca has long been a haven for the Spanish royals  Juan Carlos  the former king  and his family have their vacation palace on the island  and local business dignitaries even once bought the monarch a luxury yacht So it might seem odd that residents of the island town of Valldemossa  population 2 000   where Juan Carlos holds the title of honorary mayor   were asked to vote in a straw poll last Sunday on whether Spain should retain the monarchy or become a republic The nonbinding poll  sponsored by a local political party  was held without an official census and at a makeshift polling station next to the food and handicraft stalls of Valldemossa s weekend market  The removal of the monarchy was approved by 97 votes to 25  with one person casting a blank vote ImageTourists mostly visit Valldemossa to see its medieval monastery  in which the composer Frdric Chopin and the writer George Sand spent a winter in the 1830s CreditSamuel Aranda for The New York TimesEven if the vote was only symbolic  the organizers said it was important to include the monarchy in a broader debate over whether and how to reform the country ahead of national elections this month  called by the Socialist government after its national budget was rejected  At the same time  Spain is struggling with a secessionist challenge in the northeastern region of Catalonia  What really matters is that we re now finally able to discuss openly the role of the monarchy   said Ddac Alcal i Villa  who represents the organizing party  known as  The Valldemossa We Want  and who is in charge of the town s education and culture  Similar votes were scheduled for Sunday in several other towns on the island  following Valldemossa s lead The Spanish royal family returned to the throne in 1975 when Juan Carlos became king two days after the death of Gen  Francisco Franco ended a long period of dictatorship  But two years earlier  the authorities in Majorca  knowing of Juan Carlos s fondness for sailing and their island  offered to convert a palace called Marivent into his vacation home  even though the property s former owner had bequeathed it to become a museum

Times I respect different opinions  but not when the only goal is to divide our society   Ms  Mayol said   We ve seen in Catalonia how these things develop  You plant a seed in the minds of people and then end up with a huge conflict  Mr  Alcal i Villa acknowledged that he had been inspired by straw polls on independence that were held across Catalonia  long before separatist political leaders held a referendum on secession in October 2017 even though it had been declared unconstitutional  Former Catalan separatist leaders are now on trial before the Spanish Supreme Court  accused of staging a rebellion in their effort to declare independence The fight over independence has split Catalan society down the middle  and in Majorca and the rest of the Balearic archipelago  where the Catalan language is also spoken  nationalist parties have been gaining votes  Even if our situation isn t comparable to that of Catalonia  it could become so in a few years if we don t put a brake on this   said Xavier Pericay  a regional lawmaker who helped found Ciudadanos  a centrist party that has led the fight against Catalan secessionism   The republicans and the separatists might appear to focus on different issues  but they are pursuing the same goal  which is to scrap anything that represents the power of the state   he added Separatists and anti royal militants also found common ground after Felipe stepped into the Catalan conflict in October 2017  accusing the region s separatist leaders of  inadmissible disloyalty  after holding the referendum  which took place amid clashes between the Spanish police and voters   The king made a decisive intervention in Catalonia  but that of course helped bring together those who agitate against the monarchy and those who have pushed for an independence referendum   Mr  Pericay said Some voters in Valldemossa said they wanted to remove the monarchy as an outdated institution  but had no desire for Majorca to split from Spain  They also noted that people had already taken to the streets across the country in 2014 to demand a referendum on the monarchy after King Juan Carlos announced his abdication  Removing the monarchy is about having a modern state   said Mr  Alcal i Villa  calling it a broader issue  over which there is more consensus than any territorial question   

TOKYO   Nissan Motor Co shareholders ousted Carlos Ghosn as a director on Monday  severing his last tie with the Japanese automaker he rescued from near bankruptcy two decades ago and from which he is now accused of siphoning funds Days after Ghosn s latest arrest in Tokyo  shareholders gathered for an extraordinary meeting  expressing bafflement and disquiet about growing allegations of financial misconduct laid out before them   while seeking more clarity on how Nissan plans to recover from the scandal Meeting shareholders for the first time since Ghosn s initial arrest in November  Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa and Jean Dominique Senard  the chairman of its alliance partner Renault  said they needed to focus on collaboration and improving governance at the Japanese company  But they offered few concrete details about the way forward  I can t comprehend how this could have happened  despite having auditors   said Setsuko Shibata  a retired homemaker who said her family had held Nissan shares for decades   I can t say I feel better about the situation after today s explanation  Ghosn has denied all the allegations against him and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup Proceedings were at times interrupted by some hecklers on the floor of the meeting  which was attended by a near record high 4 100 shareholders The shareholders voted to remove both Ghosn and co accused Greg Kelly from Nissan s board of directors  Kelly has also denied the charges against him They also voted in Senard as a director  a move that was widely seen as an attempt to assuage concern about the future of the Nissan Renault automaking alliance engineered by Ghosn ALLEGATIONSProsecutors last week took the highly unusual step of re arresting Ghosn   who had been out on  9 million bail   returning him to the Tokyo detention center where he had previously spent more than 100 days Under the latest allegations  he is suspected of trying to enrich himself to the tune of  5 million at the automaker s expense Ghosn s lawyers called the arrest an attempt to muzzle him  He was due to speak at a news conference this week  but instead a video statement from him will be shown on Tuesday at the Foreign Correspondents  Club of Japan  FCCJ   the FCCJ said on its website   Ghosn has been charged with under reporting his Nissan salary for a decade  and of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan s books  However  the new allegation is potentially more serious  as it could show he used company funds for his own purposes  SHAREHOLDERS BAFFLEDBoth Saikawa and Senard talked about the need to focus more on unity and respect among executives and workers  although neither offered details on the outlook for their complex capital structure  in which smaller Renault owns a bigger share of Nissan  I will constantly suggest the best possible evolutions in the framework of the alliance   Senard said after voters approved his appointment to Nissan s board   We want to secure the right future for Nissan   he said  without elaborating The fall of one of the world s most feted executives appeared to have left some Nissan shareholders nonplussed  I was hoping to hear more details about the path forward  I wanted to know what sort of role a Japanese company can play in an international alliance like this   said a shareholder who declined to be identified for personal privacy issues  The situation seems to go deeper than it looks based on the information   said 68 year old shareholder Roberto Montoya   I m very suspicious of the situation  and most people are  Saikawa said Nissan may claim damages against Ghosn and that he did not want to pay severance to the former chair  He also said he would work to stabilize the company before standing down as chief executive  This is not an issue we can fix overnight   Saikawa told shareholders   We need to fulfill the task  of improving governance  and prepare the company for our next steps  and then pass the leadership baton    Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu  Additional reporting by Maki Shiraki  Writing by Chris Gallagher  Naomi Tajitsu and David Dolan  Editing by Christopher Cushing  

ATHENS   Greece s potential next prime minister  Kyriakos Mitsotakis  says he plans to unblock privatizations  cut taxes and enact meaningful reforms to attract investment  increase state efficiency and make the pension system viable  With opinion polls putting him more than 10 points ahead of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras  the conservative leader is confident an EU election next month will prove to be a springboard to winning a national vote expected by the autumn  We ll be implementing them  reforms  not because they are part of a program but because we truly believe that they are necessary to make the Greek economy more competitive   Mitsotakis told Reuters from the headquarters of New Democracy  Greece s main opposition party  By implementing reforms  he says Greece can persuade its lenders  who still monitor the economy even after it officially exited its 280 billion euro financial crisis bailouts  to lower their targets and convince investors that it is out of the woods The 51 year old scion of a powerful family of politicians considers Greece s post bailout primary surplus targets  too high   but says that they must be respected  at least in the short term   Greece tapped international bond markets with a 10 year bond earlier this year  its first such issue in a decade  But at 18 percent the unemployment rate remains the highest in the euro zone and so is its debt  standing at 180 percent of output  The economy is not the only issue for a future Greek leader to grapple with Mitsotakis maintains deep reservations at the deal brokered by the leftist government recognizing the neighboring state with the name North Macedonia  Skopje should not expect an automatic entry pass into the European Union now the name dispute is resolved  Mitsotakis said With many Greeks still struggling with the effects of creditor mandated austerity though  the upcoming elections will undoubtedly become a referendum on how firebrand leftist Tsipras  elected in 2015  handled the crisis Mitsotakis camp is already on a war footing ahead of the EU parliamentary vote on May 26  People come and go from his office  adorned with paintings  pictures of his family and his late father   a former prime minister   books  a model ship named  Leadership  and a stuffed toy lion People who know him say an unflappable demeanor denotes an attention to detail  a workaholic who came in as an outsider to win the party leadership in 2016  Greece emerged from the third bailout nine months ago  But Mitsotakis says it has not turned a corner   it is just comparatively better than 2015  when he says bungled negotiation tactics by Tsipras s government almost got it thrown out of the euro zone  Tsipras says he had no other option but to accept it   VICIOUS CIRCLE The economic monitoring framework includes meeting an annual primary budget surplus   excluding debt servicing costs   of 3 5 percent of GDP until 2022   Once we deliver the reforms  I think that would be the right time to discuss the primary surpluses   he said  Apart from pushing hard on  emblematic investments   such as a real estate project at the former Athens airport and a Chinese investment at Greece s largest port in Piraeus  his gameplan includes cutting corporate tax to 20 percent from 28 percent and tax on dividends to 5 from 10 percent within two years The middle class is overtaxed  he said   They ve taken more money out of people s pockets than it was necessary so I plan to return some of it back to people and to the corporations   Greece sees growth at 2 5 percent this year  But Mitsotakis said the country needed at least 4 percent economic growth  to convince everyone that it has broken out of the vicious circle   At the end of the day what is going to make our debt sustainable is if Greece is going to move to a different growth trajectory   he said Mitsotakis s party stridently opposed the deal recognizing the ex Yugoslav Republic as North Macedonia  a view shared by many believing the name claimed by the northern state is an appropriation of Greek culture and heritage  Although we don t like the agreement we ll respect it   the leader said   But we ll work to improve aspects or consequences of the agreement that are currently not in our interest  For years  the wrangle has stopped the small state from joining NATO and the EU  North Macedonia is expected to join the alliance in 2020  But joining the EU  which includes each member state approving a candidate s compliance in various policy areas  is a longer process  I don t think anyone should expect Greece to agree to open and close chapters when there are still outstanding issues which have not been addressed by the agreement   Mitsotakis said   Of course we fully retain the right to block this process if we think that our national interests are not met    Reporting by Renee Maltezou and Michele Kambas  Editing by Alison Williams

Israel stood still for a moment this week so it could bring home the remains of Sgt  Zachary Baumel  a soldier who perished in battle in 1982  This was in the midst of the most bitterly contested election the country has had in decades  with important things at stake  the probity of government  relations with the Diaspora  the limits of the settlement enterprise  the possibility of peace There are things that matter more  Keeping faith with the fallen and bereaved is one of them Anyone who has lived in Israel gets this  It s a young and improvising state resting atop an ancient and profound civilization  At the heart of the civilization is common memory  Elections come and go  memory accretes  It is to everyday life what geology is to flora and fauna  grounding  shaping  slow moving  still growing  Memory is the true land of Israel The Israeli government spent 37 years tracking Baumel s remains to Syria and negotiating their recovery through Russia  The country will expend similar efforts to bring home other fallen soldiers held in enemy hands  It s the core of the Jewish state s social contract  It may not be able to keep its people safe  much less make them rich  But it will never forget or forsake them That s something to consider when it comes to the election  too  In Washington last month I interviewed Benny Gantz  the former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces who now leads the Blue and White party  the principal challenger to Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud Gantz doesn t communicate a political agenda so much as he does a character and an attitude  He s an Israeli of the old school  confident  to the point  unassuming   a man who tries  but doesn t quite succeed  in hiding his warmth  In our interview he described himself as a security hawk and a  moderate capitalist   but otherwise his ideology is mainly about not having one The interview itself was unremarkable  Gantz had a slight lead in the polls at the time  he s now in a dead heat  though the outcome of the election will depend on how smaller  coalition making parties fare   and he seemed to be taking care to say nothing that would get him into trouble  Here  condensed for clarity  is what stood out ImageIsraeli soldiers carring the coffin of Sergeant Zachary Baumel during a military funeral at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem CreditAbir Sultan EPA  via ShutterstockOn Netanyahu   Very smart  a good manager  a good politician  He s what so many Israelis would like to see  in a prime minister   In the last four or five years  something happened to this guy  I don t know what happened  It s unexplainable  On Palestinian statehood   Israel needs to stay a Zionist country with a Jewish majority in a democratic system  Eventually  Palestinians should have some kind of independency  On egalitarian prayer spaces   The Western Wall is long enough to accommodate everyone  On Israel s security needs vis  vis Palestinians   We should maintain security for a perimeter outside  Palestinian areas   Conduct security inside  If we don t  it will endanger Palestinians themselves  The economies should eventually be merged  On relations with the U S    We share the same values and moral standards and we share the same interests  And it stands for both sides of the aisle  On whether he would serve in a coalition with Netanyahu  either over or under him   No  On what distinguishes his party from Netanyahu s   We have left and right  religious and secular  Druse  ultra Orthodox women  Unity is very important  We cannot agree on everything but we must agree on the framework    Netanyahu currently lives off this separation  between various Israeli groups   I m talking about my priorities  but I m talking to everyone  He s appealing to his base  That last observation is the essential point  In many ways  Israel has defied expectations and done remarkably well over the past decade  Much of this has been Netanyahu s doing But it has come at the cost of increasing divisions between Israeli and American Jews  And intense divisions between Orthodox and non Orthodox Jews  And embittering divisions between Jewish and non Jewish Israelis  And between the hard right and everyone it deems a sellout   an ever growing group when one practices the politics of loyalists versus traitors  as opposed to the politics of friends and potential friends None of these quarrels are about Israel s enemies  who are real  deadly and growing in number  But the quarrels have become enemies in themselves  Israel is powerful enough to defeat any of its regional adversaries  in almost any combination  It can survive the challenge of the Palestinians and binationalism  too  Whether it can survive its own descent into sectarian and ideological tribalism is another matter Which is why the return of Baumel s remains seems so propitiously timed  Israeli pundits think it will help Netanyahu s re election chances  on the view that it makes him seem more capable and statesmanlike I wouldn t be so sure  Baumel s short life  tragic death and hard fought homecoming are potent reminders of all the ties that still unite the Jewish state  for all the differences  They are what commends Gantz s candidacy  whether he wins this time or not The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think

President Trump earlier this year asked Senator Mitch McConnell  the majority leader  to prioritize a confirmation vote for his nominee to be the chief counsel of the Internal Revenue Service  indicating that it was a higher priority than voting on the nomination of William P  Barr as attorney general  a person familiar with the conversation said White House aides insisted for months that the confirmation of the nominee  Michael J  Desmond  a tax lawyer from Santa Barbara  Calif   was a top priority after passage of the tax bill in 2017 But the request by Mr  Trump  made to Mr  McConnell on Feb  5  raised questions about whether the president had other motivations  For months  the president has seethed over vows by congressional Democrats that they would move to obtain his tax returns from the I R S  And this week  the House Ways and Means Committee chairman  Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  formally asked the I R S  for six years of the returns  using an obscure provision in the tax code to do so On Thursday  asked if he would direct the I R S  not to disclose his tax returns  Mr  Trump said Democrats would have to talk to his lawyers  They ll speak to my lawyers   Mr  Trump said during remarks at the Oval Office   They ll speak to the attorney general  In July  when Mr  Desmond was first being considered by the Senate Finance Committee  Bloomberg reported that he had briefly advised the Trump Organization on tax issues before Mr  Trump took office  James Wilkinson  a spokesman for Mr  Desmond  told Bloomberg that Mr  Desmond had helped with  a discrete reporting matter for a subsidiary company that was resolved with no tax impact  In private practice  Mr  Desmond worked for a time alongside William Nelson and Sheri Dillon  who currently serve as tax counsels to the Trump Organization The I R S  chief counsel advises the agency director on  all matters pertaining to the interpretation  administration and enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code  as well as all other legal matters   according to a description on the agency s website  The chief counsel reports jointly to the director of the I R S  and the Treasury Department s general counsel The Senate did not immediately act on Mr  Trump s request  It first moved ahead with Mr  Barr s nomination  Mr  Desmond was confirmed two weeks later  on Feb  27 Mr  Trump and his team have been warily anticipating the probing demands of House investigators since Democrats won control in November  The message to Mr  McConnell came around the time that Mr  Trump  eyeing a torrent of new House investigations led by Democrats  told reporters that he was unfairly under fire He appeared to take particular umbrage at an inquiry by the House Intelligence Committee focused on potential ties to Russia  as well as accusations of potential money laundering by Mr  Trump s businesses and his associates  It s called presidential harassment   he said   And it s unfortunate  And it really does hurt our country  The president directly relayed his concern about the prompt confirmation of Mr  Desmond to Mr  McConnell around the time that Mr  Trump was preparing to deliver his State of the Union address  the person said Hogan Gidley  a White House deputy press secretary  declined to discuss the specifics of the conversation between Mr  Trump and Mr  McConnell  Democrats have obstructed and delayed a record number of President Trump s well qualified nominees  so it shouldn t be surprising to anyone that he regularly communicates with Majority Leader McConnell about how to increase confirmations in the face of Democrats  ridiculous behavior   Mr  Gidley said David Popp  a spokesman for Mr  McConnell  also declined to comment But according to a person familiar with what took place  Mr  Trump told Mr  McConnell that Mr  Desmond was growing frustrated with the holdup and was contemplating withdrawing from the process Democrats in the House are relying on a little known provision of the federal tax code to try to view Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns  The provision  added in the 1920s  gives the chairmen of Congress s tax writing committees   including the Democrat led Ways and Means Committee in the House   authorities to request information on any filer to review privately The text of the law does not give the Trump administration clear grounds to deny a request from Mr  Neal  saying only that when requested  the Treasury secretary  shall  furnish the information  But Treasury Department officials are making preparations to challenge any requests coming from Mr  Neal  They would most likely argue that his action is politically motivated  not related to real matters of policy and therefore illegitimate Mr  Trump  asked on Wednesday about the request by reporters during an Oval Office event  maintained that he was still being audited  a claim he has made for years to defend not releasing his tax returns  as previous presidents have done  

WASHINGTON   The House passed legislation on Wednesday that would guarantee broadband internet users equal access to online content  in a crucial step toward bringing back so called net neutrality regulations overturned at the start of the Trump administration In a 232 to 190 vote  divided along party lines  the Democratic majority made good on a promise that became a rallying cry in many progressive circles during the 2018 election  It is also expected to be held up as an issue by Democrats in 2020 But the legislation  the Save the Internet Act  faces long odds in the Republican led Senate  The Senate leader  Mitch McConnell  said this week that the legislation would be  dead on arrival   Earlier this week  the Office of Management and Budget advised the White House to veto the law if it reached the president s desk  The office said in a letter that since the law had been overturned  the broadband industry had thrived  a good sign of how deregulation helped the economy The legislation would prohibit blocking and throttling web traffic and would categorize broadband as a service open to heavy regulation  Supporters say the regulation would prevent companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of content like videos  Opponents say it would strap broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast with heavy handed restrictions  and could lead to price controls  We need a law that puts a cop on the beat who will enforce the laws  because we can t just rely on internet providers to say this will be a free and open internet   Representative Frank Pallone  Democrat of New Jersey  said in an interview   No one believes them  ImageAjit Pai  chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  rolled back net neutrality rules in 2017 CreditJacquelyn Martin Associated PressThe Federal Communications Commission rolled back the country s net neutrality rules in November 2017  Shortly after  internet companies and public interest groups sued to overturn the action  which was led by Ajit Pai  the agency s chairman In addition  more than two dozen states have raced to create their own net neutrality laws  The Justice Department and telecommunications companies have  in turn  sued to block the state efforts Net neutrality  a regulatory idea hatched by academics  has been a decade long battle pitting Silicon Valley and consumer groups against the telecommunications sector  Companies like Google  Mozilla and Facebook have argued that without rules  telecommunications companies can become gatekeepers of online content by choosing the quality of the delivery of web services in a way that could hurt rivals and consumers  The Obama administration sided with their argument  with the F C C  approving new regulations in 2015 Now  the companies are pushing for a law on the issue  A group of 120 start ups  including Stripe  Medium  and GitHub  wrote a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders in support of the bill  Net neutrality is fundamental to guaranteeing that every American has unencumbered access to the internet   the companies wrote   This access is also essential to a competitive  free market for the technology economy to thrive as well as entrepreneurship in this country  The biggest disagreement between Republicans and Democrats is whether broadband should be considered a utility like phone service  Republicans say that doing so could lead to the possible regulation of broadband rates  Democrats say the categorization is an important update that recognizes the importance of broadband to the economy  culture and education  Some in Congress are trying to give the government more control again  applying utility style regulations that would threaten the internet as we know it  We should reject these efforts   Senator Roger Wicker  Republican of Mississippi  said on the Senate floor last week  

JERUSALEM   Benjamin Netanyahu  Israel s conservative prime minister for the past decade  appeared poised to win a fourth consecutive term in office  and a fifth overall  according to preliminary results early on Wednesday Both Mr  Netanyahu and his chief rival  Benny Gantz  a centrist former military chief  declared victory after Tuesday s parliamentary election  appearing to win the same number of seats in the Israeli parliament  But a count of the broader blocs needed to form a coalition government appeared to give Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party a clear advantage over Mr  Gantz s Blue and White Mr  Netanyahu now seems all but sure to surpass the nation s founding leader  David Ben Gurion  as Israel s longest serving prime minister Victory would also provide Mr  Netanyahu  69  with a renewed mandate as he battles a looming indictment on charges of bribery and corruption A dominant global player who has built a strong economy  Mr  Netanyahu is widely credited with having kept the country secure and delivered a series of long sought diplomatic victories  many of them thanks to President Trump Regardless of the outcome  Mr  Gantz s strong performance was a remarkable achievement for a political newcomer and a brand new party  Mr  Gantz  a career soldier who retired as chief of staff in 2015  entered politics last year for the first time  joining forces with two other former army chiefs in an effort to blunt Mr  Netanyahu s claim that only he could keep Israel safe More than a million Israelis appeared to have voted for Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party  placing it in the position of being the main alternative to Israel s right wing  a spot once held by the Labor Party ImageSupporters of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesInitial exit polls had projected a muddled outcome  and many Israelis went to bed on Tuesday suspended in a post ballot twilight zone  The final tally may not be known until the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients are counted later this week The exit polls of the three main television channels were sufficiently disparate that both sides claimed victory  This is a night of tremendous victory   Mr  Netanyahu said after entering a jubilant campaign celebration around 2 a m  to cheers and chants of  Bibi  king of Israel   I believe that the Lord and history have given the people of Israel another opportunity  a golden opportunity to turn our country into a strong nation  among the strongest nations of the world   he said He said he expected to forge a new coalition with the right wing parties he called his  natural partners   but that he intended to be  the prime minister of all the citizens of Israel  Earlier  Mr  Gantz entered a packed election night headquarters in Tel Aviv to thunderous cheers  declaring   We are the winners   He promised to be  the prime minister of everyone and not just of those who voted for us   and argued  when early exit polls had him in the lead  that the largest party should be the one granted the mandate to form the next government By dawn  Likud and Blue and White appeared to have won at least 35 seats each in the 120 seat parliament  But the right wing and religious parties together commanded a potential majority of at least 65 seats  leaving the center left bloc trailing far behind with 55 President Reuven Rivlin is expected in the next few days to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority ImageSupporters of Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditLior Mizrahi Getty ImagesAs Mr  Netanyahu has drifted steadily to the right  the left has migrated to the center  after years of violence in the second Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s and the absence of a viable peace process since Mr  Netanyahu has benefited from strong support from President Trump  who in the past two years has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal  recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital and just two weeks ago recognized Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights The Trump administration weighed in again on Monday  declaring the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization  By Monday night in Israel  Mr  Netanyahu was boasting on Twitter in Hebrew   but not in English   that this was in fulfillment of  another important request of mine  But Mr  Netanyahu s pursuit of a fourth consecutive term came as he faces indictment for bribery and other corruption charges  The evidence in those cases  which was kept under wraps until after the election to avoid leaks that could tilt the contest against Mr  Netanyahu  are now to be turned over to lawyers in the case  meaning Mr  Netanyahu could be plagued by damaging reports while he tries to assemble a coalition And it could be difficult for him to remain in office once formal criminal charges are lodged against him  possibly as soon as late summer Mr  Netanyahu spent much of the past year undermining law enforcement officials and the gatekeepers of Israel s liberal democracy  railing against the police  the attorney general and what he called the  leftist  mainstream media  trying to delegitimize his critics and organizations working for Palestinian rights  His government has also worked to curb the powers of the Supreme Court Even as Mr  Netanyahu forged diplomatic ties and trading partnerships with new countries  he stymied any prospect of a resolution of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  aided by a weak  divided and at times recalcitrant Palestinian leadership  Veering farther to the right in the final days of the election campaign  he pledged to start annexing parts of the occupied West Bank if re elected  a move he had long resisted He was widely expected in his coalition negotiations to try to trade passage of annexation laws for retroactive immunity to prosecution in the corruption cases against him ImageA woman voting in Ramat Gan on Tuesday  If the vote remains close  it may come down to the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients counted later this week CreditOded Balilty Associated PressBut Israelis as a whole have lost faith in a two state solution  polls show  and the election seemed to bear that out For many Palestinians  the distinctions between Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz were inconsequential Saeb Erekat  the chief Palestinian negotiator  pointed to one exit poll showing that only 18 of the Parliament s members still supported a two state solution  calling this  a consequence of the culture of impunity granted to Israel   What the exit polls suggest is that Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo   he said   They have said  no  to peace and  yes  to the occupation  Early analysis showed a historically low turnout among Arab citizens of Israel  many of whom boycotted the vote out of disillusionment with Israeli politics and with their own politicians By nightfall Arab leaders were frantically trying to rally their supporters  mosques were broadcasting appeals from minaret loudspeakers  and a last minute surge of participation seemed to materialize in some predominantly Arab towns  though that was not captured in exit polls Despite the broad margin of support for a Netanyahu government  coalition negotiations may still prove difficult  with several small parties acting as kingmakers and Mr  Netanyahu vulnerable to political extortion  The question is whether people will climb down from their trees or not   said Abraham Diskin  a professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  referring to the lofty demands and conditions some party leaders have already placed on entering a coalition Mr  Gantz and his allies in the Blue and White alliance have pledged not to join a government with a prime minister facing indictment ImageLaborers hanging a campaign banner depicting Mr  Netanyahu  center  with other candidates of his Likud party  in Jerusalem last month CreditAmmar Awad ReutersLike most Israeli election campaigns  this one ripped open the fissures in Israeli society  With Mr  Netanyahu facing indictment and battling for his political survival against Mr  Gantz  the most credible challenger in a decade  many Israelis said it was the nastiest and most divisive race they could recall With three former army chiefs in Blue and White s top four slots  Mr  Netanyahu was unable to rely on his usual politics of fear  presenting himself as the only candidate able to provide Israelis with security Instead  his campaign focused largely on perceived enemies within Mr  Netanyahu fanned the flames of anti Arab sentiment  warning Israelis that Mr  Gantz would  hand over parts of the homeland to the Arabs   He also joined forces with a racist faction  one of whose members was ultimately barred from running in the election by the Supreme Court On Election Day  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling places in Arab towns in what they said was an effort to capture evidence of any irregularities  but Arab leaders called it a blatant attempt at voter intimidation The dwindling left  for its part  accused Blue and White of being right wing  saying that it was conspiring to join a Netanyahu government Mr  Netanyahu tried to cast the race as one between an experienced world leader and an unproven political novice  His party raised questions about Mr  Gantz s sexual propriety  his vulnerability to extortion by the Iranians after his cellphone was apparently breached  and even his mental stability Mr  Gantz s party said it wanted to put Israel back on course  It fought Mr  Netanyahu s polarization with promises of restoring a sense of unity  decency and democratic values The fate of smaller parties at both ends of the spectrum was unclear and could still prove significant  It s been a long night   Mr  Netanyahu said at his post midnight rally   And it will be a long day waiting for the true results

BEIRUT  Lebanon   Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on Wednesday to be on his way to a fifth term as prime minister of Israel  solidifying the sense across the Arab world that the dream of a Palestinian state is more remote than ever   as is the chance that the United States will help create it Throughout his campaign  Mr  Netanyahu appealed to right wing voters by making promises to them about issues long expected to be negotiated with Israel s Arab neighbors And through his close relationship with the Trump administration  he pushed for the United States to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Days before the election  he suggested he would annex at least some of the West Bank if he won The strategy helped ensure his grip on power  It closes all doors for any possible peace settlement and any chance for the Palestinians to have a state of their own   said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla  a political scientist from the United Arab Emirates  While that would cause frustration among the Arabs  there was little they could do about it  he said  The Arabs are at their weakest  The Palestinians are divided like never before  Israel is stronger than ever and Trump backs it  so Israel can do whatever it wants   he said For decades  support for the creation of a Palestinian state was a rare issue met with consensus across the Arab world  Israeli leaders faced limits on the kinds of unilateral actions they could take for fear of causing pushback from the Arabs or from the United States and other Western countries But that dynamic has faded as the peace process stalled for years and as the Palestinians remain divided among themselves  with different factions in charge of the West Bank and Gaza The Arab Spring uprisings and their violent aftermath left many Arab leaders more focused on staying in power than on standing up for the Palestinians  And Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have quietly warmed up to Israel  seeing it as a valuable partner in confronting their common enemy   Iran Arab investment in the peace process dwindled even further with the election of President Trump  whose administration has built warm relations with Mr  Netanyahu while isolating the Palestinians  Leaders of allied Arab states did not want to jeopardize their own relations with the new administration by pushing the Palestinian cause The shrinking horizon for a Palestinian state  is concerning  but are the Arab regimes concerned   asked Michael Young  a senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut  Lebanon   The Saudi and Emirati minds are on Iran  and they are not going to undermine their relationship with the United States and with Israel over these issues  ImageLaborers at a construction site in Beitar Illit  an Israeli settlement in the West Bank  Days before the election  Mr  Netanyahu suggested he would annex at least some of the West Bank if he won CreditRonen Zvulun ReutersSyria  which has long opposed Israel s existence  has been so badly weakened by years of civil war that it could muster no more than formulaic condemnations when Mr  Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Israel seized the territory from Syria in the 1967 war Iraq  too  has been ground down by years of battle to oust the Islamic State from a chunk of its territory Dealing with the issue is more complicated for United States allies that made peace with Israel  hoping their agreements would pave the way for a broader agreement with the Palestinians In Egypt  President Abdel Fattah el Sisi rarely speaks of the Palestinians and has embraced Mr  Trump as a rare American leader who does not criticize his human rights record Jordan  a close Arab ally of the United States  perhaps has the most to lose from Israel s rightward lurch  It shares a long border with Israel  has a large Palestinian population and remains invested in resolving the core issues of the conflict  such as the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian refugees  Now  with the new American approach  none of these positions will be respected   said Oraib al Rantawi  the director of the Al Quds Center for Political Studies   Jordan is not happy to see Netanyahu elected again as prime minister of Israel  and we fear that we are not headed toward more conflict between Israel and the Palestinians but between Israel and Jordan  But there was little Jordan could do other than reject proposed settlements that are not to its liking or that impose specific roles on Jordan  like absorbing Palestinian refugees Mr  Netanyahu s win could play into the hands of Arab militants  such as those in Hezbollah and Hamas who call for Israel s destruction  because it bolsters their argument that negotiating with Israel is a waste of time  Netanyahu will likely form a new  right wing Zionist government  and we are before a new stage of unprecedented cooperation between America and Israel represented in Netanyahu and Trump   Hezbollah s leader  Hassan Nasrallah  said in a speech on Wednesday It remains to be seen whether Mr  Netanyahu will make good on his election promises  Significant Israeli moves in the West Bank could result in new violence with the Palestinians  and many Arabs would automatically support their Arab brethren And cozying up to Israel too much could harm the standing of Arab leaders before their own people  The Palestinian situation has been written off so many times but it remains a big issue for many Arab citizens   said Mr  Young of the Carnegie center   We shouldn t underestimate how this could be a problem for some of these regimes in terms of their legitimacy   

If  at more than a year long  the race to elect the president of the United States is an ultramarathon  Australia s campaign season is a sprint Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia fired the proverbial starting pistol on Thursday  declaring a federal election for May 18 and kicking off a 38 day dash to the ballot box counting today and Election Day  There is so much at stake at this election   Mr  Morrison said at a news conference in Canberra  emphasizing his party s platform focused on economic issues and tax cuts  There is more to do   he added   and a lot has got done  It s still not clear exactly how many days of campaigning will be allowed  the Labor Party leader  Bill Shorten  has called for a campaigning ban on at least two holidays between now and Election Day But clearly  Australia s race will be quick  By contrast  the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States lasted 596 days  counting from the date of the first major candidate s official declaration to Election Day  The 2020 campaign  one of the longest in history  is set to last 1 194 days   the equivalent of more than 30 Australian election seasons The election comes at a critical time for Australia  an American ally  which is torn on important issues such as climate change and how to contend with China s rise On the surface  a shorter campaign period would seem to prevent voter fatigue and limit the extent to which questionable financial contributions can muddy the process  But experts say campaigns of even a few weeks are marred by many of the same problems seen in longer elections Ultimately  a shorter campaign has less to do with perfecting the process and more to do with simply speeding it up What determines a campaign s length The length of a campaign can be boiled down in most democracies to this question  Are you electing a president or a prime minister  Put another way  Are you voting for an individual who you need time to get to know  or are you voting for a legislating party that is headed by a leader with whom you re already familiar Because the parties in the parliamentary system choose their candidates for prime minister   in the case of Australia s main parties  Scott Morrison of the Liberal Party and Bill Shorten of Labor   there is no need for months of vetting  debates or primaries ImagePrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia  center  had to call an election before June CreditSam Mooy EPA  via ShutterstockA 2015 study  analyzing more than 26 000 polls in 45 countries since 1942  found that voters  preferences take much longer to form in a presidential election than a parliamentary one because presidential voters need more time to assess the candidates Parliamentary systems also differ from presidential republics in the frequency with which elections can be called  In a presidential system  the term of office is fixed  and campaigning for the next election effectively starts when the last election ends But in a parliamentary system  general elections can be called more regularly and with less notice  To avoid lengthy gaps without a government  many countries have laws limiting the duration of a campaign How does Australia stack up Australian campaigns last between 33 and 68 days  That s short by American standards but an eternity compared to Singapore  a country that has been governed by the same party for five decades  and which gives voters just nine days to choose a candidate Campaigns in Japan run for 12 days  In France  campaigning before the first round of voting can last no more than two weeks  The campaign period in Canada lasts about 36 days  in Britain five to six weeks and in Israel 101 days Like Australia  those counties all have legally fixed campaign periods According to John Keane  a professor of politics at the University of Sydney and author of  The Life and Death of Democracy   the writers of Australia s Constitution had good reason to limit the length of campaigns The writers feared  that since the House of Representatives would usually not last three years from the time of its first meeting  and since sitting governments and politicians in search of victory might be tempted to string out election campaigns  good government would suffer   Professor Keane said They also worried  he added  that  abuse of power and political discontinuity would get the upper hand  Hence the need to place strict time limits on election campaigns  Why now Members of Australia s lower house of Parliament  the House of Representatives  have to face voters every three years  and the last general election was held in 2016  To meet the time frame  Mr  Morrison had to declare an election before June Mr  Morrison has been in power since August  but this is the first time he will face voters as the head of the Liberal Party  He took office after a party putsch  known as a leadership spill  that ousted his predecessor  Malcolm Turnbull By law  the election cannot coincide with state elections or holidays  and has to take place on a Saturday ImageLawmakers at Parliament House in Canberra in November CreditTracey Nearmy Getty ImagesDoes compulsory voting result in less partisanship Saturday elections and a contracted campaign period are Australian traditions meant to increase voter engagement and turnout  Similarly  Australians are required by law to vote and are fined if they do not Compulsory voting clearly increases participation  but the data is mixed on whether it entrenches partisanship  One 2012 study found that  compulsory voting boosts the likelihood that one will identify with a party and  in turn  the strength of party attachments  But in her book  From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage  How Australia Got Compulsory Voting   Judith Brett  an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University in Melbourne  Australia  argues that voters are increasingly disenchanted with the major political parties More than ever  Professor Brett writes  Australians are splitting their votes between parties in House and Senate elections  Without compulsory voting   she writes   many disillusioned voters would turn away from politics altogether and stop voting  Does a shorter campaign make it harder to buy influence American candidates cannot sustain the lengthy campaign season   or afford costly ads   without raising large amounts of cash  In 2016  Hillary Clinton raised  1 4 billion and Donald Trump raised  957 million It is easy to believe that a shorter campaign would limit the amount of money that candidates need to run  thereby decreasing their opportunities to exploit financing loopholes But  according to Professor Keane   time limits on election campaigns have little to do with the need to dampen financial fraud   If anything   he added   the short election campaigns do the opposite  As in practically every democracy  our elections are awash in dark money  The government provides public financing for the parties  which in theory should limit the impact of moneyed interests  But there are loopholes that allow the parties to accept corporate and private donations with little oversight A study by the Grattan Institute  an independent Australian think tank  found there was no way to account for more than 60 million Australian dollars  or about  42 7 million  donated to political parties in the 2016 17 financial year In the prior fiscal year  which included the 2016 federal election  Grattan found that at least 40 percent of party contributions   154 million Australian dollars   could not be traced to their donors  

Israel s parliamentary election on Tuesday brings an end to a neck and neck campaign that saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  the veteran politician of the Israeli right and one of the country s longest serving leaders  facing the strongest challenge in years  Mr  Netanyahu s tenure has been marked by a collapse of peace talks with the Palestinians  confrontation with Iran  armed conflict with Hamas  and hostility toward what he views as plots to isolate and delegitimize the Jewish state But Mr  Netanyahu has also overseen an era of healthy economic growth and stability  thawed relations with Sunni Arab leaders and expanded Israeli trade ties in Africa  Latin America and Asia   Read more on Mr  Netanyahu s ties with President Trump that have emboldened him to take policy risks  The prime minister is entangled in corruption scandals that could lead to his indictment  And he faces stiff competition from a new rival  Benny Gantz  the leader of a trio of former generals who could end Mr  Netanyahu s 10 uninterrupted years as prime minister But Israeli elections are complicated and unpredictable  with many parties vying for votes and at times forming opportunistic

White alliance  a coalition named for the colors of the Israeli flag  slightly ahead of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  a dominant force on the Israeli right for decades Their policy stances are similar  a reflection of how Israeli politics have moved increasingly to the right under Mr  Netanyahu  But while Mr  Gantz has sought allies from across the spectrum  Mr  Netanyahu has reached out to the far right to strengthen his prospects for a parliamentary majority  He even has promised to begin extending sovereignty over the occupied West Bank  which the Palestinians want for a future state  if he is re elected The Blue and White leaders are drawing on their military backgrounds to counter Mr  Netanyahu s contention that only he can protect Israel  Mr  Gantz and his colleagues have also focused on the corruption accusations against Mr  Netanyahu  his biggest vulnerability  to press their case that new leadership is needed They have attracted backing from smaller centrist parties  And what remains of the left leaning opposition has thrown its support behind Mr  Gantz for prime minister  The Labor Party would be likely to recommend Mr  Gantz for the premiership after the election What makes this election different Mr  Netanyahu could be indicted  Israel s attorney general announced last month that he planned to bring charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  A final decision on charges is likely by year s end  Under the current law  Mr  Netanyahu  if re elected  would not have to resign until a final conviction  although new legislation or public pressure could force him to step down  Mr  Netanyahu has described the charges as a baseless partisan witch hunt  But with a first sitting prime minister to be charged  Israel would be entering uncharted legal and political terrain The uncertainty has worked against Mr  Netanyahu in the prelude to the vote   The attorney general s report has done something that has never happened in Israel s 70 year history  and that is that a prime minister is under a legal cloud   said David Makovsky  an expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  The election also is the first time that three former heads of the army  the Israel Defense Forces  have united to run for office  The Blue and White alliance is led by Mr  Gantz and two other veteran generals  Gabi Ashkenazi and Moshe Yaalon They have teamed up with a well known centrist party  Yesh Atid  led by Yair Lapid  a former journalist  television host and finance minister  Mr  Gantz has agreed to hand off the prime minister position to Mr  Lapid after two and a half years if their parties win  While Mr  Netanyahu has a strong record of defending Israel  the Blue and White alliance s military credentials have made it more difficult for him to attack Mr  Gantz and his colleagues as weak on security   The question is  will it neutralize the advantage that Netanyahu has accrued over his previous four terms of being  Mr  Security    Mr  Makovsky said   He s said the words Israelis want to hear   I ll keep you safe    How does the voting work Voters cast ballots for parties  not individual candidates  to fill seats in the 120 member Knesset  or Parliament  The seats are divided proportionally based on the percentage of the vote each party receives  Any party that wins 3 25 percent or more of the vote gets at least one seat  If parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes won t be counted  That will raise the share of seats given to the other parties  If one party were to win at least 61 seats  it would be entitled to form a government  But this has never happened in Israeli politics  So once the seats have been apportioned  parties try to cobble together coalitions that control a majority of seats  ImageAn election billboard for the New Right party  with which Likud is expected to align CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat might those alliances look like Polls have suggested that Likud and Blue and White will each get about 30 seats   meaning both will be seeking alliances with smaller parties  Likud is expected to align with a  right wing party known as the New Right  and with an extreme right alliance known as the Union of Right Wing Parties  which includes Jewish Power  widely criticized as an extremist  anti Arab racist party  Potential Blue and White coalition partners include the Labor Party and the leftist Meretz Party  among others  Read about the Palestinian rapper who is  urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes by boycotting the elections  Will the outcome of the vote be clear immediately Probably not  The president  Reuven Rivlin  has the discretion to give the party leader with the best chance of forming a majority coalition the first opportunity  Typically  but not always  that opportunity goes to the leader of the party with the most votes  who then has 42 days to try  If that party leader fails  the president turns to another to attempt to create a coalition  So it could take a few months It also is possible that the Likud and the Blue and White coalition would join forces and create a national unity government  In theory  Mr  Rivlin could offer both Mr  Gantz and Mr  Netanyahu this opportunity and they could take turns as prime minister Mr  Gantz has rejected that idea  vowing that he will not sit on a government with Mr  Netanyahu  though a leaked recording suggested that he might  ImageAyman Odeh  a leading Arab politician  in Nazareth last month  CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat about  Arab citizens of Israel They represent nearly a fifth of the country s 5 8 million eligible voters  which could give the four Israeli Arab parties a potential kingmaker role  But these parties have never joined a governing coalition in Israel  And some Israeli Arab voters have vowed to boycott the election  partly in protest of a new law pushed by Mr  Netanyahu declaring Israel as the  nation state of the Jewish people   Critics have called the law racist and undemocratic What about Palestinians in occupied territory They are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote in the election  About 4 75 million Palestinians fall into this category  according to the Institute for Middle East Understanding  an American nonprofit educational group that promotes Palestinian viewpoints Could the election affect a potential peace plan Still steeped in secrecy  President Trump s long anticipated plan to resolve the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is not much of an issue in the election  Nevertheless  it could be affected Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law  who has been leading the administration s efforts to draft the plan  said it would not be made public until after the election Many Palestinians already have dismissed the plan   whatever it may contain   because they see Mr  Trump as siding with Israel  But the plan also faces a threat from the parties of the Israeli extreme right  which see any concessions to the Palestinians as unacceptable  If Mr  Netanyahu needs those parties to form a coalition  Mr  Trump s peace plan may be doomed However  if Blue and White wins or forms a national unity government with Likud  that could make way for possible cooperation with the Trump administration on a plan  David M  Halbfinger  Isabel Kershner and Herbert Buchsbaum

PHILADELPHIA   Since her book  Lead From the Outside  came out in paperback last month  Stacey Abrams has been showing up in places befitting a woman whose razor thin loss in the 2018 Georgia governor s race turned her into a national political star On  Morning Joe   she parried questions about a possible presidential run  On  The Late Show   Stephen Colbert surprised her by reading from one of the romance novels she has published under a pseudonym But last Friday  Ms  Abrams dropped in on a much quieter venue  the Library Company of Philadelphia  founded in 1731 by Ben Franklin  which bills itself as the oldest cultural institution in the United States It wasn t a stop on Ms  Abrams s book tour  Instead  she was there to participate in an intimate two hour conversation about the history of voter suppression with four leading scholars  It will be published next year by the University of Georgia Press as part of a new series called History in the Headlines  which aims to bring historical expertise to bear on today s most hotly debated issues The Trump era has been a red alert moment for many historians  who have mobilized in the classroom  on op ed pages and on social media to combat what they see as the erosion of democratic norms and an attack on truth itself For the conversation  the moderator  Jim Downs  a professor at Connecticut College  had recruited what he called a  dream team   Carol Anderson  the author of  One Person  No Vote   Heather Cox Richardson  an expert in the history of the Republican Party  Heather Ann Thompson  the author of a Pulitzer Prize winning account of the Attica prison revolt  and Kevin M  Kruse  who has become famous for his epic Twitter threads smiting the dubious historical claims of pundits and politicians Before the event  they seemed galvanized at the prospect of talking with someone who has  as Dr  Kruse put it  skin in the game  When the email went out saying she was coming  I was like     Dr  Anderson  a professor at Emory University  said  clutching her heart  A few minutes later  Ms  Abrams approached  I just thank you for what you do   Dr  Anderson said  introducing herself   You just bring it  in whatever forum  You bring it  ImageThe conversation  to be published next year as part of the book series History in the Headlines  also included Heather Cox Richardson and Kevin Kruse  at left  and Heather Ann Thompson CreditMichelle Gustafson for The New York TimesAsked why she wanted to take time out from her public schedule to participate  Ms  Abrams   a Democrat who has called her loss  fully attributable to voter suppression    said she welcomed the context historians brought to what she has made a signature issue  I m a little bit of living history for some of this   said Ms  Abrams  who  had she prevailed  would have been the first black woman elected governor of any state  But mostly  she said   I m here to listen  The Library Company dcor is old school patrician  think early American furniture and dead white guy oil portraits   but in recent years it has emphasized its rich holdings in African American history  Before the event  library staff members had laid out some items relating to the 15th Amendment  which gave black men the right to vote in 1870 After the group arrived  the archival items were cleared off the table  and replaced by a bowl of Philly soft pretzels  Mr  Downs started out on a  relatively  light note  asking participants for their own early memories of voting Dr  Kruse  who teaches at Princeton  recalled voting for Gerald Ford in a preschool election  mostly because like his dad  Ford played golf  Dr  Richardson offered a rueful college memory of not bothering to vote in the 1980 presidential election Ms  Abrams  45  flashed back to that same election  and what she said was the only  physical altercation  she ever had in school  with a classmate who called Jimmy Carter a Communist  I got into my first fight  Democrat versus Republican  in second grade   she said  She paused   I won  ImageThe Library Company  founded in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin  houses a substantial collection of material relating to African American history  like this 1870 lithograph commemorating the 15th amendment  which gave the vote to black men CreditMichelle Gustafson for The New York TimesThe nearly two hour conversation  which was not open to the public  pinged back and forth between past and present  To the group  the Supreme Court s 2013 decision in Shelby County v  Holder  which invalidated portions of the Voting Rights Act and freed nine states  mostly in the South  from federal oversight of elections  was reminiscent of the rollback of African American political rights after Reconstruction What is different about voter suppression today  they agreed  is that it has been accomplished by bureaucratic maneuvering that makes it harder to see There was discussion of the battles over the so called Motor Voter Act of 1993  which gave rise to increasing Republican claims of widespread voter fraud  After 1993  Republicans started asserting that Democrats  are only winning because there are illegitimate voters   Dr  Richardson  who teaches at Boston College  said Dr  Kruse brought up the rise of  colorblind conservatism   and pulled out his phone to check a quote from Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia  who  during oral arguments in Shelby  called extending the Voting Rights Act  a perpetuation of racial entitlement   So the Voting Rights Act isn t about equality  it s about giving African Americans an unfair advantage   he said   Which is a bizarre reading of history  Some of the questions felt like fact gathering for future histories  Mr  Downs asked Ms  Abrams how she had reached the decision to make her fiery speech  10 days after the Georgia election  announcing that she was ending her campaign but  pointedly  not conceding She said voter suppression was too often abetted by the  complicity  of political candidates  including the losers  Part of the reason voter suppression works is we ve created this culture that says you don t challenge the outcome of elections  unless the act is so egregious as to be absolutely clear on its face   she said   Fair Fight Action  a group allied with Ms  Abrams  has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Georgia s election procedures and accusing her opponent  Brian Kemp  who  as Georgia secretary of state  oversaw the election  of systematically disenfranchising poor and minority voters  The scholars offered correctives to some popular narratives  starting with the argument  invoked often by Ms  Abrams s critics  that Richard Nixon had graciously conceded the 1960 presidential election  for the good of the country  rather than challenge rumored fraudulent votes for John F  Kennedy At least that s the way Mr  Nixon told the story in his book  Six Crises   Dr  Kruse said  But in fact  he noted  the Republican Party had begun challenges in 11 states  before dropping them Near the end of the conversation  when Mr  Downs invited questions from the small group of observers  one person addressed what she called the  unspoken  political consensus in the room  raising the counterargument that focus on voter suppression was just a strategy for getting more Democrats elected Dr  Thompson  who teaches at the University of Michigan  warned against  fetishization  of the Democratic Party   At every step along this historical path  Democrats    and not just Dixiecrats    have many times been intensely interested in disenfranchising poor urban black voters too   she said Ms  Abrams noted that she had appeared in a Fair Fight Action commercial aired in Georgia during the Super Bowl alongside a Republican county commissioner  Voter suppression  she said   can eviscerate democracy for everyone  If there was palpable admiration in the room for Ms  Abrams  she beamed it right back  Politicians  she told the group   need your help   We tell the same myths over and over again until they sound like truth   she said   Where I think historians can help preserve and actually restore democracy is to remind us of how we got it   

The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau  Sign up to get it by email    Australians will go to the polls next month to elect a new government  and because elections take place as soon as 33 days after they re officially called  the country s politicians will have to move quickly to solidify votes Whoever takes the helm will have to contend with a set of challenges that mirror those of other democracies around the world Here s a look at some of the key domestic and international issues that we ll be watching and that Australia s leaders will be confronting Election MeddlingIn February  Australia became the latest Western nation whose institutions had most likely been tampered with after the government acknowledged that Parliament s computer network had been hacked by a foreign government No country has been named as being behind the cyberattack  but security experts say China  Russia  and possibly Iran and North Korea are among the suspects Officials said the three major political parties were among those affected  but wouldn t say to what extent  because they hadn t seen anything like this breach before  Even as he said a  sophisticated state actor  was behind the attack  Prime Minister Scott Morrison insisted there was  no evidence of any electoral interference  Australian elections are quick  they are compulsory and the majority of voters will cast their ballots on paper  However  during the last federal election  some areas used electronic lists to check voters  names off electoral rolls  It s not yet known if those electronic lists will be used in light of the recent hack ChinaThe Australia that will go to the polls in May is markedly different to the one that voted in 2016  particularly when it comes to China  Then  the Australian economy was on fire  Chinese investment had surged to a new high  and while the government blocked some Chinese bids for infrastructure projects  it was a record setting year for deals with Chinese companies For years  the Australian government had been able to successfully navigate its economic ties with its largest trading partner  China  and its strategic relationship with its greatest ally  the United States  without having to compromise on either But a slew of events have redefined Canberra s relationship with Beijing  In 2017  a prominent Australian senator  Sam Dastyari  resigned over accusations of lobbying for Beijing and taking money from Chinese born political donors  The government passed a foreign interference law  requiring lobbyists for other countries to register and disclose their activities   one of many efforts to push the Chinese government s soft power campaign out of the shadows And in August  Australia banned Huawei  the Chinese technology giant  from participating in the building of a fifth generation telecommunications network Politicians have been reluctant to explicitly discuss the China challenge up till now  but pressure will continue to build no matter who wins the election The EnvironmentIt was ostensibly energy policy that led to Malcolm Turnbull becoming the third prime minister in 10 years to lose the job   a dispute about addressing climate change prompted the change But the public is far less divided  A recent poll found that 59 percent of Australians are concerned about climate change and frustrated at the lack of initiative from Canberra to address it Several independent candidates are running in key electorates   including the former head of a clean energy corporation who is campaigning for the seat won last time by Josh Frydenberg  the treasurer Even so  the two main political parties have staked out vastly different positions on climate change  The Labor Party has said that there will be no new coal powered plants if it wins  but the Coalition has not ruled them out  Labor also supports a 45 percent emissions target by 2030  while the Liberal Party said that it is committed to 26 percent by 2030  Labor has also promised rebates for households installing solar batteries and wants 50 percent of new car sales to be electric vehicles by 2030 Mr  Morrison says he will spend billions of dollars on a hydroelectricity project to help alleviate rising power bills and offset carbon emissions  He has criticized the opposition s policies  arguing that higher emissions targets would  crash the economy  ImmigrationAs President Trump calls for funding to build a wall on the Mexico border  Mr  Morrison continues to boast of his role in stopping boats full of asylum seekers heading to Australia  and now wants to limit the number of skilled migrants who come to the country legally each year The move to reduce the current cap on immigration by nearly 30 000 people is seen as a step back by many  The country has relied on immigrant labor to fuel its economic boom as its population has grown to 25 million  The move also represents a reversal for Mr  Morrison  who pushed back against cutting the cap before he became prime minister The Labor Party  on the other hand  wants to increase the annual refugee intake from 16 250 to 27 000 by 2025 and said it would stick to the current migration cap should it win But the issue of immigration has created a heated debate in Australia  as voters and politicians ask  How much of the opposition to immigration comes from concerns over strained infrastructure in cities  and how much comes from racism  Islamophobia and fear A senator recently made global headlines when he blamed Muslim immigration for the mass shooting in Christchurch  New Zealand Mr  Morrison has had to deflect criticism of his party as anti immigrant and anti Muslim  When asked if the Coalition had a problem with Islamophobia  he said   As leader  my job is to set the right tone  And the tone I have set  you can see from my experience  My example has been to work with the Muslim community very deeply  So what s the most important issue for you

party officials Steve Dickson  left  and James Ashby tried last Tuesday to explain comments recorded by a reporter undercover for Al Jazeera CreditDave Hunt EPA  via ShutterstockMany of you weighed in on our examination last week of Al Jazeera s undercover investigation on the National Rifle Association and whether it was ethical  Thanks to all who wrote in or shared in our Facebook group  Here s a few of your responses  I am all for journalists using deception if it is the only way to expose something as serious as the activities of the gun lobby and One Nation  We heard them say to put nothing

expose what One Nation really stand for  I like it  Would I like it if some of my political allies were shown up as a bit grubby  Well not as much  but its still a legitimate technique     John Brookes Your ethics guide is right  The last thing you want is to be accused of deception in pursuit of a story as that diminishes the validity of said story  The issue of what  and who makes the determination  is in the public interest is equally as important  The case of the N R A  and One Nation is a clear cut case of foreign intervention in our democratic process  That is a concern and definitely in the public interest  But there are cases  no doubt  that are less clear  which begs the question  how does the NYT decide what is in the public interest  Sticky area     Ian Baxter

LONDON   British lawmakers endorsed Prime Minister Theresa May s request to the European Union to delay Brexit until June 30 at a vote in parliament on Tuesday  adding weight to the pitch she will make to EU leaders in Brussels  The majority of May s Conservative Party voted alongside the opposition Labour Party to back the prime minister s approach by 420 votes to 110  The main rebellion came from pro Brexit Conservatives who want Brexit to happen sooner   We should all be very clear what this extension would be for   it is all about making sure we leave the EU in a timely and orderly way and that means leaving with a deal   government Solicitor General Robert Buckland said ahead of the vote The debate came as May traveled to Berlin and Paris to drum up support for her request for more time to try and find a new plan for Britain s EU exit that can command the support of her political opponents at home  The vote itself was the culmination of an unprecedented power grab in parliament by lawmakers who this week passed a law against the government s wishes  seeking guarantees that May would not let Britain leave the EU without a deal on April 12  But because May has already requested a delay  and with no alternative dates chosen to be voted on by lawmakers on Tuesday  the vote was not a major flashpoint in the country s long running political crisis over how to deliver Brexit Nevertheless  the process of passing a law to trigger Tuesday s debate has further undermined May s political authority  proving parliament is able and willing to circumvent the government if they disagree with her choices on Brexit Labour Party junior Brexit spokesman Matthew Pennycook said his party supported May s extension plan  but warned the extra time must be used to try and find a compromise with Labour and not to pass her own thrice rejected deal at a fourth attempt   The public will not forgive the government if an extension is sought and agreed under the pretence of efforts to secure cross party compromise   he said   Additional reporting by Elizabeth Piper  Kate Holton and Alistair Smout  editing by Stephen Addison  

UMM AL FAHM  Israel   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s party sent monitors equipped with body cameras to a number of polling stations with Arab constituents on election day in Israel on Tuesday  and Arab politicians condemned the move as voter intimidation Asked about the use of cameras in polling stations  Israeli police said there had been  a number of suspected irregularities  in the north  where many Israeli Arabs   who comprise 21 percent of the population   live Netanyahu  head of the right wing Likud party who opinion polls showed was neck and neck with a centrist rival  defended the filming  saying that cameras should be posted openly at voting stations everywhere to ensure  a valid vote  In 2015 Netanyahu angered Israeli Arab leaders when he said that Arabs were flocking  in droves  to cast ballots  Analysts said the remark was an attempt to galvanize his right wing base  and that it deepened longstanding mistrust among Arabs On election days in Israel  representatives of most parties sit at venues to check the pre vote identification process  Voters are then handed an envelope and go behind a screen to cast their ballot in private Arab lawmaker Ahmad Tibi said the cameras seen at polling stations on Tuesday were illegal  and were a  direct attempt to sabotage  the freedom to vote Jamil Baransi  Deputy Mayor of Reineh  an Arab town in northern Israel  said monitors from right wing parties had brought cameras to all of 17 local polling centers  We noticed that each one of these representatives had a camera on them  on their bodies   he said  adding that he believed the cameras were  designed to intimidate voters  He said police intervened and people with cameras had left In such a close election  a key factor could be the Arab turnout  Many Arabs were angered by Israel s nation state law  passed in 2018  which declared that only Jews have the right of self determination in the country  Netanyahu backed the measure  CAMERA CONTROVERSYArab officials at polling stations in several Arab towns in the north said the cameras were not filming behind the screens but were attached to the shirts of Likud representatives  with the camera lenses visible Complaints came from polling stations in districts with predominantly Arab or mixed constituencies  Asked if representatives with cameras were also sent to mostly Jewish areas  a Likud spokesman said he did not know A Likud party official confirmed that cameras were deployed  saying it was to ensure there would be no vote rigging  They are not hidden cameras  They are cameras in the open   Kobi Matza  a Likud election official  told Kan radio station   We are worried about counterfeit  votes  in the Arab sector  The head of Israel s election committee  Justice Hanan Melcer  said he was aware of complaints about  hidden cameras   but it had been  made clear that voters had not been filmed inside the voting booth  He said it was forbidden to film inside polling stations unless there was concern over  significant harm  being caused to the voting process  such as threats  bribery or violence An election committee official said he was not aware of cameras being used in past elections Israeli police said there had been  a number of suspected irregularities  at polling stations in the north  The police are working in these specific places in coordination with the Elections Committee in order to maintain public order and prevent any further incidents related to the voting polls in today s elections   a police statement said Ahmad Jamal Mahagny  30  voting in the northern town of Umm al Fahm later in the day  said   I m not sure what they were trying to do  Perhaps they wanted to disqualify the votes here  Many in Israel s Arab communities say they face discrimination and are treated as second class citizens   Reporting by Ron Bousso  Rami Ayyub  Stephen Farrell  Ari Rabinovitch  Dan Williams and Ran Tsabari  Editing by Mark Heinrich

BANGKOK   Thailand s military junta is targeting a popular new pro democracy party  accusing its leader of causing disorder that could lead to rebellion even as the seat allotments from last week s parliamentary elections are being calculated The billionaire leader of the Future Forward Party  Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  was ordered on Wednesday to submit to the police for questioning in the case  which initially opened four years ago  He is accused of helping protesters flee arrest at a demonstration and faces up to seven years in prison Mr  Thanathorn  who has built a large following partly through social media  posted the summons on Facebook and Twitter and wrote   When the dark power won t leave Future Forward alone   It s clear now that the old school political game won t end after the election  but is only getting more intense  because they re afraid of Future Forward   he added  The party came in third in the balloting last week The summons came Wednesday  a day after Thailand s Army chief  Gen  Apirat Kongsompong  warned that the military would not tolerate threats against the country s constitutional monarchy  in which the king is deemed head of state  Some considered his comments to be directed at Future Forward  The army does the army s duty  which is to protect  maintain  and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy   the general told reporters The interventions are the latest indications that the Thai junta is clinging to every advantage it can to gain an edge through the election  And the junta gave itself many of those advantages  as it put in place a new Constitution and electoral system after seizing power in a 2014 coup Those changes gave the generals sweeping influence over Parliament itself  and over an Election Commission with great power to bar candidates and target lawmakers for ejection ImageRepresentatives of the Pheu Thai and the Future Forward parties during a meeting after the election last month  The opposition coalition  including Pheu Thai and Future Forward  claimed on Wednesday that it would have a razor thin majority in the House CreditGemunu Amarasinghe Associated PressThe first electoral test for that new system came last week when Thailand finally held its long delayed parliamentary election  And though the results are not yet official  it is already clear that the regime s system is doing what it was designed to do  splintering the pro democracy opposition  and entrenching the junta s authority  Thailand is headed to a military guided  authoritarian system   said Purawich Watanasukh  a research fellow at the independent King Prajadhipok s Institute in Bangkok According to the Election Commission s preliminary results  the leading vote getter was the military backed party  Palang Pracharat  with about 24 percent  But that is less than half the popular vote received by the next three parties  which all campaigned for a return to democracy  In total  they received 51 percent of the vote  according to the early count  Palang Pracharat ran on the idea of maintaining stability and continuity and the others ran on the basis of restoring democracy   said Verapat Pariyawong  a visiting scholar at SOAS School of Law at the University of London   The majority of Thai voters went for the idea that we need to restore democracy  In parliament s lower house  the House of Representatives  the likely result will be a sharply divided body and a weak coalition government  The commission has until May 9 to announce the official results Calling itself the National Council for Peace and Order after it seized power  the junta drafted a new Constitution  the country s 20th  which was ratified in a 2016 referendum  For that vote  the junta blocked opponents from campaigning and barred election monitors Voters approved a separate measure allowing the military to appoint all 250 members of the Senate  who will join the 500 member lower house in selecting the next prime minister Critics contend that the entire system is rigged in the military s favor  That is partly through its influence over the powerful Election Commission  which came under fire for numerous irregularities during the balloting  delays in announcing the vote count  and an unexpected surge in the number of votes reported At one news conference  the commission s president  Ittiporn Boonpracong  told reporters that he could not work out the party list percentages because he did not have a calculator with him ImageDozens of protesters gathered in Bangkok on Sunday to protest the Election Commission s handling of the vote and what they termed cheating CreditLauren Decicca Getty ImagesAt another  the commission released 208 pages of election data and told reporters to figure out the seat allocations themselves Initial delays prompted the United States State Department to call for transparency  We stand with the Thai people in calling for the expeditious announcement of voting results and a fair and transparent investigation of any reported irregularities   a State Department spokesman  Robert Palladino  said last week More than 5 6 percent of the votes cast were invalidated  including some for not being marked properly  If they had gone to a single party  that party would have finished sixth over all Another 24 percent of the votes were spread among more than 70 other parties  fulfilling the military s goal of fragmenting the vote In the 2011 parliamentary election  more than three quarters of the vote went to two parties  Pheu Thai and the Democrat Party  which finished second and fourth in last week s election   An election held in 2014 was ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court  The military has another edge  as well  the timing of the coronation of a new monarch  King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun  expected May 4 to 6 That is only a few days before the election results become official  And the effect  in a country with strict laws against criticizing the monarchy  has been to make pro democracy leaders reluctant to stage any major protests before the coronation Dozens of protesters did gather on Sunday afternoon to protest the Election Commission s handling of the vote and what they termed cheating Still  the military may have to use even more tactics to fully secure a win Under complex rules that do not necessarily reward winning the most votes  Palang Pracharat will hold about 118 seats in the House while the opposition Pheu Thai Party is likely to get about 137  according to unofficial projections ImageCasting votes in Bangkok on election day  The Election Commission has until May 9 to announce the official results CreditWason Wanichakorn Associated PressThe opposition coalition  including Pheu Thai and Future Forward  claimed on Wednesday that it would have a razor thin majority in the House But under the country s new Constitution  and an accompanying body of law that followed it  the deck is stacked against them Since the next prime minister will be chosen by a combined vote of the House and the military appointed Senate  it is likely that the junta leader and current prime minister  Prayuth Chan ocha  will be named to head the new government And whatever the outcome of the vote  the Constitution gives the military the authority to shape Parliament s membership in the months and years ahead The Election Commission can seek to remove members for election misconduct and call new elections in those seats  in some circumstances barring the previous winner from running again  More than 180 such complaints have been filed  They have the whole year to disqualify people   said Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee  a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok   So the number can be changed the whole time  In addition  Mr  Verapat  the University of London visiting scholar  pointed out that the Constitution gives military appointed officials the power to remove members of Parliament any time for violating broad  ethical standards  The standards include adhering to democracy with the king as the head of state  pursuing the public interest over private interests and conducting oneself in an honest manner Government officials and courts will have wide discretion under the law to decide what violates the ethics standards  he said  Even if the so called democratic coalition was able to form a government   Mr  Verapat added   they would face a tough road ahead   

NEW YORK   John Murante  a conservative Nebraska senator  last year introduced a bill to prevent non citizens from being counted when the state redraws its voting maps He said the effort aimed to ensure each election district contained similar numbers of voters  but opponents argued it intended to undermine the political power of immigrant communities Murante s bill died after its critics pointed out a lack of granular data on where the state s non citizens live  That data may soon be available The Trump administration believes its proposed question about citizenship on the 2020 Census will help states that want to draw citizens only voting districts in the next round of redistricting by providing the first comprehensive data on non citizens in about 70 years  according to a Reuters review of court and federal register documents and interviews with more than a dozen state lawmakers Such a change would provide a new opportunity for Republican controlled states   those most likely to adopt citizens only redistricting   to redraw their voting maps in a way that could help their party win more state level elections Currently  state and federal voting districts are drawn to be roughly equal in population  regardless of how many residents can legally vote  That means tallies for district drawing purposes include non citizens  such as green card holders and undocumented immigrants Democrats and immigrant rights activists say this system ensures elected leaders represent everyone in their district who depends on public services such as schools and trash pickup  regardless of voting eligibility Republicans argue that districts should be the same size so each vote carries the same weight  If one district has far fewer eligible voters than another  each vote there has more influence on election outcomes  That s a problem for Republicans because the eligible voters in immigrant heavy districts tend to support Democrats Trump administration officials have been considering the merits of citizens only redistricting since 2017   well before announcing their intention in March 2018 to add the citizenship question to the decennial survey  according to court documents filed as part of litigation over the citizenship question And in December  the Census Bureau issued a notice in the Federal Register saying that if any states  indicate a need for     citizenship data  to use in redistricting  it would  make a design change  to provide it Republican lawmakers in Texas  Arizona  Missouri and Nebraska told Reuters they would consider making use of the citizenship data if it became available The tactic is prohibited at the federal level by past U S  Supreme Court decisions that have interpreted the U S  constitution as requiring that U S  House districts be based on total population  But the court  in a 2016 case known as Evenwel v  Abbott  left the door open for state level districts to use other metrics The Commerce Department  which includes the Census Bureau  declined to comment on whether redistricting was part of the motivation for proposing the citizenship question  James Whitehorne  the chief of the Census Bureau s Redistricting   Voting Rights Office  called the federal register notice routine   We re supposed to provide states with what they identify as needing   he said U S  voting districts are drawn at the state level  most often by state legislators  giving the party in power control over how the lines are redrawn  While both Republicans and Democrats frame the debate over citizen only districts around fairness  demographic experts point out that both sides have a lot at stake politically Data from the nonpartisan APM Research Lab showed that 95 of the 100 U S  congressional districts with the highest foreign born populations are represented by Democrats  Similar data for state level seats was not available Redrawing such districts with citizen only populations would give Republicans a better shot by expanding the districts into more conservative areas  said Albert Kauffman  a professor at St  Mary s School of Law in San Antonio who has studied redistricting and opposes excluding non citizens  In Texas  a citizens only map could strip Latino voters of majorities in two or three state senate seats and six or seven state representative seats  Kauffman said  pointing out that Hispanic voters traditionally lean left   Democrats know they would probably lose seats at every level   Kauffman said SUPREME CHALLENGEImmigrant rights activists and Democratic led cities and states have sued the Trump administration to prevent it from asking census respondents about their citizenship  and the Supreme Court will decide by June if the question can remain Opponents argue the administration aims to use the question to intimidate immigrants out of responding to the census  which would cost their communities political representation and a share of about  800 billion in annual federal aid allocated based on population The administration disputes that  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his decision to add the question was aimed at getting the Justice Department the comprehensive citizenship data it needs to better enforce Voting Rights Act provisions that protect minorities from discrimination  Ross has not publicly commented on how citizenship data might be used in redistricting  But Census records  as well as emails released during the litigation over the citizenship question  showed he was thinking about citizens only redistricting well before he announced plans to add the question In April of 2017  at the behest of former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon  Ross spoke with former Kansas Secretary of State and noted immigration hawk Kris Kobach  according to the emails  One topic of discussion was  the problem that aliens     are still counted for congressional apportionment   according to a subsequent email from Kobach to Ross describing their conversation  The following month  Ross asked Commerce Senior Policy Advisor David Langdon to look into whether non citizens  including illegal immigrants  are included in voting maps  according to Langdon s deposition in the litigation over the citizenship question  Kobach and Langdon did not respond to requests for comment  ATTRACTING INTERESTA handful of states will likely request the census data on citizenship if the question survives its legal challenges  state lawmakers and a Republican strategist told Reuters  Lawmakers and state officials from Arizona  Missouri  Nebraska and Texas said in interviews they are considering citizen only districts  Republicans in Tennessee also voiced support for citizens only redistricting in court papers filed in the Evenwel Supreme Court case  Reuters reached out to several of the Tennessee lawmakers who signed the court brief  but all declined to comment Missouri Representative Dean Plocher  a Republican who sponsored unsuccessful legislation last year to base Missouri s voting districts on citizen population  said the effort is aimed solely at equalizing the power of all votes in the state  He said he hadn t considered how such changes might affect his party s chances in elections Nebraska s Murante   the former senator behind his state s failed citizens only redistricting bill and now the state s treasurer   said he supports citizens only maps because the state s constitution requires that  aliens  be excluded from voting districts Immigrant rights activists counter that citizens only districts could be forced to expand in ways that weaken the political influence of immigrant communities The effect could be particularly pronounced in places such as south Texas  where immigrants make up more than a quarter of the population  said Juan Hinojosa  a Democratic state senator  Hinojosa s district includes areas known as colonias   informal communities of poor  largely Hispanic families  Citizen only redistricting would make it more likely that anti immigration Republicans would win elections in the border region  Hinojosa said The question of how to count non citizens in voting districts may end up at the Supreme Court  said Kel Seliger  a Republican Texas state senator  who told Reuters that lawmakers there would explore citizen only maps  You ve got be careful   he

BANGKOK   Thailand s first general election since a 2014 army coup has been touted by the ruling military junta as a return to democratic rule  but two weeks after the vote  results are still unclear and allegations of manipulation are mounting Since the March 24 vote  figures linked to a  democratic front  of opposition parties say they have come under increasing pressure from police and the military The Election Commission has also indicated it would use a complex allocation formula for 150  party seats  in the House of Representatives in a way that would likely dilute the opposition alliance s seats in the 500 seat lower house The Election Commission has said it won t announce even provisional winners of the 150 party seats until May 9  saying it needs time to order by elections and vote recounts as well as to disqualify candidates who broke election laws But critics say the time gap allows the military royalist establishment to manipulate results and disqualify opponents of the pro army Palang Pracharat party that seeks to keep junta leader Prayuth Chan ocha in power as an elected prime minister  The leading opposition Pheu Thai party  made up of loyalists to army ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  sees the delays and legal actions as an attempt to deny the  democratic front  enough seats in the House needed to block the main junta linked party from unrestrained lawmaking power  After the election     the majority of the people feels a sense of hopelessness and distrust for the election process   said Pheu Thai s secretary general  Phumtham Wechayachai  People are talking about the Election Commission s part in supporting the extension of power by the National Council for Peace and Order   he said  using the junta s formal name The Election Commission s secretary general  Jaroongwit Phumma  told Reuters the body is not helping the pro military party  The election commission is neutral and adheres to the law  We don t take sides or help one particular party   Jaroongwit said Palang Pracharat said it does not gain any advantages over opposition parties   It s completely false to say that the election commission is helping Palang Pracharat  This is an attempt to discredit us   the party s deputy spokesman Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana told Reuters  SEDITION CHARGEHowever  opposition figures say they are being targeted Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  the leader of the youth oriented Future Forward Party which did surprisingly well in the vote  was charged on Saturday with sedition on a junta complaint dating back to 2015   a case that could see his party disbanded  Online campaigns have also cast Thanathorn as anti monarchy  a serious crime in Thailand  where the monarchy is revered without question  Thanathorn denies being against the monarchy and all charges against him  It s the establishment s desire to stir hatred  fear  and mistrust among the people  creating legitimacy for the military to take over and stay on   Thanathorn said last week Winthai Suvaree  a spokesman for the junta  said the charges against Thanathorn were not aimed at weakening the opposition and were  entirely unrelated to current political events   ABNORMAL ELECTION  The rules of the election were written in the 2017 junta backed constitution  which critics said were aimed at ensuring military influence in Thai politics Among the new provisions is that the Senate  the 250 seat upper house of parliament appointed by the junta  must approve the prime minister in a combined vote with the House  which previously solely voted on the premier That means the junta backed party and its allies have to gain only 126 seats in the House to install Prayuth as prime minister  while the opposition would need 376 votes for their potential candidate Still  days after the March 24 vote  the  democratic front  claimed through its own calculations that it would gain at least 255 House seats   not be enough to form a government but potentially allowing it to block the military backed party from having free rein Last week  however  the election commission indicated the complex formula to calculate allocation of the 150  party list  seats will round up decimals to give seats to 11 small parties although their popular votes did not meet a previously described threshhold required to earn even one seat  This is an irregularity that reflects an effort to block the democratic front from forming the next government   said Pheu Thai s spokeswoman Ladawan Wongsriwong  Widening the list would cut seats from top popular vote getters and could reduce seats for Future Forward from around 87 to 80  potentially hurting the democratic front s claim of House majority   It s an abnormal election from the outset  It s a game where the junta wrote the rules and appointed the referee  who is also acting abnormally   said Yingcheep Atchanont  project manager at legal monitoring group iLaw  Palang Pracharat has repeatedly said it reaps no benefits from the constitution Sonthirat Sontijirawong  the Palang Pracharat secretary general  has said the party would begin talks to form the next government only after the king s official coronation on May 4 6  BAD PEOPLE  The election comes after nearly 15 years of turmoil  during which conflicts between supporters of ousted former premier Thaksin and his establishment opponents manifested in street protests  violent clashes  and two military coups  On the eve of the vote  King Maha Vajiralongkorn made an unexpected statement  recalling a comment made by his late father on the need to put  good people  in power and to prevent  bad people from     creating chaos   Six days later  the king revoked royal decorations that had been awarded to Thaksin  citing his 2008 corruption conviction and for fleeing the country to escape prison  The military also stripped Thaksin of a pre cadet school s achievement award as well as deleting his name from the school s hall of fame  Thaksin continues to be a threat to the position of power of the establishment   Pavin Chachavalpongpun  associate professor at Kyoto University s Center for Southeast Asian

LONDON   Twenty five lawmakers in Britain s opposition Labour Party have urged their leader  Jeremy Corbyn  to go the  extra step  if there is a chance of agreeing a Brexit deal in talks with Prime Minister Theresa May May  whose deal to leave the European Union has been rejected in parliament three times  has turned to Corbyn in a last ditch bid to get the support of his Labour Party for an agreement she signed with the bloc s leaders in November Corbyn has welcomed the talks  but the invitation poses a threat for his divided Labour Party   some members and lawmakers are demanding a second referendum on any deal while others fear being blamed for helping pass May s much criticized agreement  The 25 lawmakers  almost all from areas which voted to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum  said the talks  represent a real opportunity  for Corbyn  a way to get a deal which would meet Labour s demands for a Brexit that protected workers  rights They reminded him in the letter that he had told May Labour would support a  sensible deal  that included  a customs union and no hard border in Ireland   protected jobs and workers  environmental and consumer standards   We believe you are close to achieving that in the coming days   said the letter whose signatories include Labour s schools spokesman Mike Kane and three lawmakers who last week voted in favor of May s deal  Rosie Cooper  Caroline Flint and Kevin Barron  At the general election  we were clear about respecting the 2016 vote  and about securing those Labour goals  Therefore  we feel if compromise is necessary to achieve this deal and avoid fighting the European elections  we should go the extra step to secure this   Corbyn  a long standing critic of the EU  has long said he wants Britain to leave the bloc with a deal  respecting the 2016 referendum when 52 percent of voters backed leaving the bloc in Britain s biggest shift in policy since World War Two But the opposition leader has been content to watch the governing Conservative Party take on Brexit  a move that has not only divided the country  but has all but redrawn the political landscape by widening rifts in the main parties In a last gamble  May announced she would bring Corbyn into talks to try to find a way to break the deadlock in parliament  which has voted against leaving the bloc without an agreement  Corbyn is pressing his desire for a  permanent customs union  and alignment with the EU s single market in the talks   red lines for a prime minister who had made controlling immigration one of the key stones of her Brexit policy But the Labour leader is under growing pressure to make any agreement with May conditional on holding a confirmatory referendum on the deal  or asking the public to back it in another vote The 25 lawmakers said such a vote was not part of Labour policy  Our policy  agreed by members  accepts that the public voted to leave the EU and seeks a deal that secure jobs and rights at work  It does not require a confirmatory ballot on any deal that meets those conditions   the letter said  Delaying for many months in the hope of a second referendum will simply divide the country further and add uncertainty for business  A second referendum would be exploited by the far right  damage the trust of many core Labour voters and reduce our chances of winning a general election    Reporting by Elizabeth Piper  editing by Guy Faulconbridge

pro boycott activists  many of whom identify as Palestinian  have tried in the past to persuade others among Israel s Arab minority not to vote But this time  they say  they are tapping into anger over the 2018 law that declares only Jews have a right to self determination in the  nation state  of the Jewish people Leaders of Israel s main Arab parties are pushing for their voters to turn out  fearing a boycott would weaken the 21 percent Arab minority s representation in parliament  and boost Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s election chances Ignoring the party leaders  dozens of activists from the  Popular Campaign to Boycott the Zionist Knesset Elections  have been handing out leaflets in the northern Israeli port city of Haifa  which has a mixed Jewish and Arab population  and in smaller Arab towns and villages  This is an attempt to boycott the body that actively tries to erase our Palestinian identity   said Joul Elias  a student from Haifa who turned up to distribute flyers in Wadi Nisnas  a majority Arab neighbourhood in the city Israel s Arab minority comprises mainly descendants of the Palestinians who remained in their communities or were internally displaced after the 1948 war that surrounded Israel s creation According to figures released by Israel s Central Bureau of Statistics  there were 1 9 million Arabs in Israel s roughly 9 million population at the start of 2019  Most were Muslims  Christians or Druze  Jews made up 74 3 percent of the population WAKE UP CALLDespite holding Israeli citizenship  many Arabs say their communities  from the fertile Galilee in the north to the Negev desert in the south  face discrimination in areas such as health  education and housing Netanyahu s ruling Likud party counters that its 15 billion shekel  3 billion pounds  investment plan for the Arab sector  is the largest such commitment in Israel s history   according to Eli Hazan  Likud s foreign affairs director But Netanyahu rekindled Arab resentment in March when he wrote on Instagram that  Israel is not a state of all its citizens   It was a reference  he said  to the new law  and the country being the homeland of the Jewish people Many in the Arab community saw the Instagram post as an echo of divisive comments he made in the 2015 election  Hours before the polls closed on election day that year  Netanyahu said that Arabs were flocking  in droves  to cast ballots  This was an attempt to prod any complacent right wing supporters to get out and vote for him  The nation state law was like a wake up call for many people  making them realise this country will never be a country for all its citizens   said Muhannad Abu Ghosh  42  a pro boycott activist from Haifa But Ayman Odeh  an Arab legislator who heads the Hadash party  says that engagement is key to bringing about political changes that will benefit the Arab minority  Our challenge  number one through five  is to increase the number of people who vote   he said He said some Arabs would  as they have in the past  vote for non Arab centr e   or left wing parties  but that even those votes  play a significant role in fighting right wing extremism in Israel  ARAB LEGISLATORSArabs have served in Israel s parliament since the country s founding  but low turnout and other factors have typically left them under represented in the 120 seat body No Arab party has served in a governing coalition  meaning they have little say in shaping Israeli policies In the 2015 election  Israel s four Arab dominated political parties united to form a  Joint List  that won 13 seats   their biggest representation yet  But this time around they are divided  which is likely to further deter an already dismayed electorate from voting  say political analysts Arab voter turnout is expected to be just 51 percent  down from 64 percent in 2015  according to a recent poll from the Konrad Adenauer Programme for Jewish Arab Cooperation at Tel Aviv University  The poll projects nationwide turnout of 70 percent  The majority of Palestinians in Israel consider the Knesset election as a practical tool  If it helps them  they will go and vote   said As ad Ghanem  a professor of political science at the University of Haifa  This time  with the collapse of the Joint List and frustration with discriminatory practices  voter turnout will be low   Ahmad Tibi  a veteran Arab legislator whose Ta al party has forged an alliance with Odeh  says Arab parties are likely to lose two Knesset seats in this election  But he doesn t see the nation state law or political division as a reason to boycott the vote   You can be a critic  you can have reservations  you can be angry at Arab parties or Arab  ministers    Tibi said   But to be nonchalant and to sit aside is not the solution  Still  the boycott movement s members  many of whom voted in previous elections  believe that grassroots activism is a more effective agent of change than voting Rula Nasr Mazzawi  43  a former activist with the Arab party Balad  says she left the faction and joined the boycott out of frustration with Arab parties  divisions in the face of what she described as Israel s  racist policies   The parties stopped working for the people  They are just clinging onto their own seats and their own power   she said   Additional reporting by Rawan Sheikh Ahmad  Editing by Timothy

WASHINGTON   The House on Thursday rebuffed a furious lobbying campaign by the National Rifle Association and approved a revamped Violence Against Women Act that would expand law enforcement s ability to restrict gun purchases by convicted domestic abusers The legislation passed easily  263 to 158  but the divided vote came on what was once a broadly bipartisan measure first passed in 1994  In recent years  partisan rancor over efforts to expand the protections of the legislation have clouded efforts to renew it  and this year  the divide was over gun control The provisions would close the so called boyfriend loophole and bar those under a restraining order or who were convicted of abusing  assaulting or stalking a domestic partner from buying guns  The N R A  seized on the new measures and warned Congress that it would track and publish how lawmakers voted  hoping to intimidate Republicans and Democrats in Republican leaning districts  Do not let the N R A  bully you   Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  urged her colleagues before the vote  noting that her recently deceased husband  former Representative John Dingell Jr   also a Democrat  was a member of the organization Thirty three Republicans bucked the threat and voted with the Democratic majority in favor of the legislation   among them  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania  the sole Republican sponsor of the reauthorization  Representative Jeff Fortenberry  Republican of Nebraska  voted present Democrats  including all of the freshman members who won in districts swept by Donald J  Trump in 2016  stood up to the gun lobby  with only one   Representative Collin C  Peterson of Minnesota   voting no Many in the new majority campaigned on tightening access to guns  and they appeared to embrace condemnation from the gun lobby as a badge of honor  Lawmakers should be reading the tea leaves   said Shannon Watts  the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  a group that supports restricting gun laws   In the midterm elections  it was gun safety that got people to the polls  Other supporters of the legislation argued that the gun provisions made up only a fraction of the protections offered by the bill  and included invaluable resources for survivors  This wasn t a gun bill   this is a bill to protect women   said Lisette Johnson  a member of the Everytown Survivor Network and a survivor of domestic abuse   This passing today is really a huge support for women and keeping them safer  Republicans had advocated a clean one year extension of the current law  which expired in February  arguing that new elements of the legislation were controversial and overreached   in particular  the gun restrictions and language offering additional protections to transgender people  Can we stop playing political games at the expense of vulnerable women   asked Representative Elise Stefanik  Republican of New York  before the vote  arguing that the bill put forward by Democrats would  collect dust in the Senate    Democrats  who booed vigorously during her speech  rejected her motion  The vote highlighted the stark contrasts between the new Democratic majority  with its historic number of women  and the Republican minority  which has struggled to attract female voters and to increase the number of conservative women holding office on Capitol Hill  Democrats framed opposition to the legislation s renewal as a denial of protections for survivors of abuse  efforts to prevent domestic violence and support for law enforcement Representative Sharice Davids  Democrat of Kansas and one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress in November  presided over the final vote on the measure  which contains a number of protections for women on tribal lands   including a new provision that would allow tribal courts to prosecute nonnative people accused of domestic crimes or dating violence on tribal lands A number of Democrats  including Ms  Dingell and Representative Katie Porter of California  offered passionate defenses of the legislation  repeatedly drawing on their own experiences as survivors of domestic abuse  I know that fear  I know that terror and I just want to try to save another family from going through that terror   Ms  Dingell said at a news conference on Wednesday  recalling being afraid as a child that her father  who had mental illness and owned a gun  would harm her mother or her siblings   Why would you not close that loophole  Republicans  beyond objecting to what they said was an infringement on gun ownership  argued that the measure contained other proposals that were too broad for a law intended to protect survivors of assault  In previous hearings and speeches  they had singled out provisions that would expand protections for transgender people and require the Bureau of Prisons to consider the safety and protection of transgender prisoners when giving housing assignments  We find ourselves debating a VAWA reauthorization act that is literally a Christmas tree of progressive liberal policy objectives  rather than an honest approach to reforming and updating such an important law   said Representative Debbie Lesko  Republican of Arizona  who is a survivor of domestic abuse The legislation heads to the Senate  where Senators Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  and Joni Ernst  Republican of Iowa  have said they will lead efforts to pass a version  It is unclear how many of the new gun provisions in the House legislation will prevail in the Republican controlled Senate  There are a number of improvements in the House bill that I think should be in our version  including preserving improvements already made in the 2013 reauthorization   Ms  Feinstein said in a statement after the vote   I hope the Senate will move quickly  This is an important law and one the Senate should take very seriously and act upon expeditiously   

LITTLE ROCK  Ark    A proposal to prohibit Arkansas cities from refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities failed before a House committee on Monday after the state s Republican governor said he wanted the legislation changed to ensure it wouldn t open the door to racial profiling The Senate backed bill to prohibit  sanctuary  cities and cut off their funding failed before the House City  County and Local Affairs Committee on a 9 4 vote  two votes shy of the 11 needed to advance to the full House for a vote  With lawmakers hoping to wrap up this year s session by Wednesday  the sponsor of the measure said it s dead The Arkansas Municipal League  which opposed the measure  has said it doesn t know of any sanctuary cities in the state or any cities moving toward adopting such policies  The Republican proponents of the bill said the measure was needed to ensure cities comply with federal law  This is not a solution looking for a problem   Republican Sen  Gary Stubblefield  the bill s sponsor  told the panel before the vote   This is to ward off what is happening all over our country  Republicans in several states have enacted bans on sanctuary cities  which have been targeted by President Donald Trump  Virginia s Democratic governor last month vetoed a similar bill  and another bill is pending before Florida lawmakers Under Arkansas  bill  a city would have been ineligible for discretionary funds administered by the state if the attorney general found it was a sanctuary city  The bill also would have prohibited cities from preventing local law enforcement from asking people about their citizenship or immigration status Gov  Asa Hutchinson said earlier Monday he was generally supportive of the measure and opposed sanctuary cities  But Hutchinson said he d asked the bill s sponsor to amend the measure to require probable cause before law enforcement asked about citizenship or immigration status  Without this amendment  there is too much opportunity for racial profiling   Hutchinson said in a statement released by his office Advocates in Arkansas said the defeated bill would have created mistrust between the immigrant community and law enforcement  Laws like this  because they are broad  they are vague and they are not clear  only exposes us to lawsuits  only exposes us to continued stereotypes of Arkansas being racist and only is going to hurt what really could be an opportunity for Arkansas to achieve a greater potential   Mireya Reith  founding executive director of Arkansas United  an immigrant advocacy group  told the panel before the vote     

Many Americans are critical of the Electoral College  an attitude that seems to have intensified since Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election despite losing the popular vote  These critics often make two arguments  first  that electing the president by direct popular vote would be preferable in a democracy  and second  that the Electoral College has disreputable origins  having been put into the Constitution to protect the institution of slavery Defenders of the Electoral College often counter that it was designed not to help maintain slavery but for other reasons  many of them still relevant  such as to balance the power of big states against that of small states   Even some critics of the Electoral College have made this argument  Both sides are misguided  There are legitimate reasons to keep the Electoral College system  odd and creaky though it may be  but we must accept the fact that it does have deep roots in efforts by the founders to accommodate slavery The Electoral College was not mainly designed to balance big states against small states  It certainly did not have that effect  Eight of the first nine presidential elections were won by candidates who were plantation owners from Virginia  then America s biggest state  Only three candidates from small states have ever been elected president  Zachary Taylor  Franklin Pierce and Bill Clinton As James Madison made clear at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 in Philadelphia  the big political divide in America was not between big and small states  it was between North and South and was all about slavery  So  too  was the Electoral College at the founding  both in its original incarnation in 1787 and in the version later created by the 12th Amendment  which was adopted in 1804 Behind closed doors at the Constitutional Convention  when the idea of direct presidential election was proposed by the Northerner James Wilson  the Southerner James Madison explained why this was a political nonstarter  Slaves couldn t vote  so the slaveholding South would basically lose every time in a national direct vote  But if slaves could somehow be counted in an indirect system  maybe at a discount  say  three fifths   well  that might sell in the South  Thus were planted the early seeds of an Electoral College system Some have argued that direct election was doomed because the Philadelphia delegates disdained democracy  Behind closed doors these elites did indeed bad mouth the masses  as do elites today   But look at what the framers of the Constitution did  rather than what they said  They put the Constitution itself to a far more democratic vote than had been seen before  They provided for a directly elected House of Representatives  which the earlier Articles of Confederation did not do   They omitted all property qualifications for leading federal positions  unlike almost every state constitution then on the books So why didn t they go even further  providing direct presidential election  Because of Madison s political calculation  Direct election would have been a dealbreaker for the South  For a while  having members of Congress elect the president emerged as a possible alternative  but this idea  too  would have been pro slavery for the same reason  Thanks to the three fifths clause  slave states got extra votes in the House  just as in the Electoral College system that was finally adopted When George Washington left the political stage in the mid 1790s  America witnessed its first two contested presidential elections  Twice  most Southerners backed a Southerner  Thomas Jefferson  and most Northerners backed a Northerner  John Adams   Without the extra electoral votes generated by its enormous slave population  the South would have lost the election of 1800  which Jefferson won It is true  as some have noted  that some Northerners manipulated the vote in that election to their advantage  but that does not erase the ugly fact that the South had extra seats in the Electoral College because of its slaves  When the Constitution was amended to modify the Electoral College after 1800  all America had seen the pro slavery tilt of the system  but Jefferson s Southern allies steamrollered over Northern congressmen who explicitly proposed eliminating the system s pro slavery bias As a result  every president until Abraham Lincoln was either a Southerner or a Northerner who was willing  while president  to accommodate the slaveholding South  The dominant political figure in antebellum America was the pro slavery Andrew Jackson  who in 1829 proposed eliminating electors while retaining pro slavery apportionment rules rooted in the three fifths clause   in effect creating a system of pro slavery electoral vote counts without the need for electors themselves Today  of course  slavery no longer skews and stains our system   and maybe the Electoral College system should remain intact  The best argument in its favor is simply inertia  Any reforms might backfire  with unforeseen and adverse consequences  The Electoral College is the devil we know But we should not kid ourselves  This devil does indeed have devilish origins RelatedOpinion   Sean WilentzThe Electoral College Was Not a Pro Slavery PloyThere is a lot wrong with how we choose the president  But the framers did not put it into the

ANKARA   Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul s municipal election said on Friday he remained ahead of his rival after a recount of invalid votes in nearly half of the city s districts demanded by President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party The AKP  hurt by a slowing economy  is reeling from its apparent loss of Istanbul  Turkey s commercial hub  and the capital Ankara  in Sunday s local elections  In power nationally since 2002  the AKP and its Islamist predecessors have dominated Turkey s two biggest cities for a quarter of a century The mayoral candidate of the opposition Republican People s Party  CHP   Ekrem Imamoglu  said he was 18 742 votes ahead of his AKP rival  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  after a recount of invalid votes in 17 of Istanbul s 39 districts and said that gap would not change much after the recount had ended  From what I see  it should end this weekend  It will fall into a 18 000 20 000 range  that s what all the simulations show  These are very tight numbers   Imamoglu told Turkey s Fox TV  adding both parties had been awarded votes in the recount The AKP s Yildirim told reporters on Friday that the margin between him and Imamoglu was falling  adding that the outcome of the recount by the High Election Board  YSK  would be different once all recounts were completed The AKP has said there are more than 300 000 invalid votes in Istanbul and just under 110 000 in Ankara It was unclear how many districts of Istanbul   a city of 15 million people   would ultimately see recounts  The AKP has requested them in all 39 Istanbul districts and all 25 districts in Ankara  where the secularist CHP has secured an apparently insurmountable lead of nearly 4 percentage points Both the AKP and CHP had claimed victory in Istanbul on Sunday night  but the next day they said that Imamoglu held a 25 000 vote lead over Yildirim In Ankara  the AKP ruling party said on Friday it had submitted an appeal to recount all votes in the capital after an initial partial recount was  far from meeting our expectations  PAINFUL FOR ERDOGANAhead of the elections  the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival the alliance between the AKP and their nationalist MHP allies  The two alliances nominated joint candidates in some cities  including Ankara and Istanbul The losses in Ankara and Istanbul  if confirmed  would be especially painful for Erdogan  who campaigned relentlessly for the local elections  He launched his political career in Istanbul and served as the city s mayor in the 1990s Speaking for the first time since Sunday  Erdogan said his alliance had won the majority of seats in Ankara and Istanbul and warned the opposition that  if they won  they would be unable to run the municipalities as they pleased  Where will the decisions on local matters  real estate and budgets go through  Through the council  You can t go and say  I m the mayor  I ll form the council as I wish    Erdogan told reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul  If a mayor doesn t have a majority  they can t form the  municipal  commissions and budgets as they please   he said  adding that the YSK s decision on the elections would be final The AKP presided over more than a decade of strong economic growth in Turkey but a currency crisis last year saw the lira lose 30 percent of its value  and inflation and unemployment have risen sharply  Critics also accuse Erdogan of becoming more authoritarian  especially after a failed 2016 military coup  In the Aegean coastal province of Izmir  a CHP stronghold  authorities launched an investigation into the new mayor of the Torbali district  Ismail Uygur  for allegedly insulting Erdogan during a speech  Uygur has denied the accusation  The AKP doesn t know how to lose  Democracy means knowing how to lose   CHP Deputy Chairman Ozgur Ozel said on Twitter Imamoglu criticized the AKP s repeated appeals for recounts  How much longer can we recount  There are recounts in some places now  but is the logic to recount until I lose    Writing by Daren Butler and Tuvan Gumrukcu  Editing by Gareth Jones and Jon Boyle  

I used to favor amending the Electoral College  in part because I believed the framers put it into the Constitution to protect slavery  I said as much in a book I published in September  But I ve decided I was wrong  That s why a merciful God invented second editions Like many historians  I thought the evidence clearly showed the Electoral College arose from a calculated power play by the slaveholders  By the time the delegates at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 debated how the president ought to be chosen  they had already approved the three fifths clause   the notorious provision that counted slaves as three fifths of a person to inflate the slave states  apportionment in the new House of Representatives The Electoral College  as approved by the convention in its final form  in effect enshrined the three fifths clause in the selection of the president  Instead of election by direct popular vote  each state would name electors  chosen however each state legislature approved   who would actually do the electing  The number of each state s electoral votes would be the same as its combined representation in the House and the Senate By including the number of senators  two from each state  the formula leaned to making the apportionment fairer to the smaller states  Including the number of House members leaned in favor of the larger states  But the framers gave the slaveholding states the greatest reward  The more slaves they owned  the more representatives they got  and the more votes each would enjoy in choosing the president The framers  own damning words seem to cinch the case that the Electoral College was a pro slavery ploy  Above all  the Virginia slaveholder James Madison   the most influential delegate at the convention   insisted that while direct popular election of the president was the  fittest  system  it would hurt the South  whose population included nonvoting slaves  The slaveholding states  he said   could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes   Instead  the framers  led by Madison  concocted the Electoral College to give extra power to the slaveholders If you stop at this point in the record  as I once did  there would be no two ways about it  On further and closer inspection  however  the case against the framers begins to unravel  First  the slaveholders did not need to invent the Electoral College to fend off direct popular election of the president  Direct election did have some influential supporters  including Gouverneur Morris of New York  author of the Constitution s preamble  But the convention  deeply suspicious of what one Virginian in another context called  the fury of democracy   crushed the proposal on two separate occasions How  then  would the president be elected  if not directly by the people at large  Some delegates had proposed that Congress have the privilege  a serious proposal that died out of concern the executive branch would be too subservient to the legislative  Other delegates floated making the state governors the electors  Still others favored the state legislatures The alternative  and winning  plan  which became known as the Electoral College only some years later  certainly gave the slaveholding states the advantage of the three fifths clause  But the connection was incidental  and no more of an advantage than if Congress had been named the electors Most important  once the possibility of direct popular election of the president was defeated  how much did the slaveholding states rush to support the concept of presidential electors  Not at all  In the initial vote over having electors select the president  the only states voting  nay  were North Carolina  South Carolina and Georgia   the three most ardently proslavery states in the convention Southerners didn t embrace the idea of electors because it might enlarge slavery s power  they feared  as the North Carolinian Hugh Williamson  who was not a slaveholder  remarked  that the men chosen as electors would be corruptible  persons not occupied in the high offices of government   Pro elite concerns were on their minds   just as  ironically  elite supporters of the Electoral College hoped the body would insulate presidential politics from popular passions When it first took shape at the convention  the Electoral College would not have significantly helped the slaveowning states  Under the initial apportionment of the House approved by the framers  the slaveholding states would have held 39 out of 92 electoral votes  or about 42 percent  Based on the 1790 census  about 41 percent of the nation s total white population lived in those same states  a minuscule difference  Moreover  the convention did not arrive at the formula of combining each state s House and Senate numbers until very late in its proceedings  and there is no evidence to suggest that slavery had anything to do with it But didn t the college  whatever the framers  intentions  eventually become a bulwark for what Northerners would later call the illegitimate slave power  Not really  Some historians have revived an old partisan canard that the slaveholding states  extra electoral votes unfairly handed Thomas Jefferson the presidency in 1800 01  They ignore anti Jefferson manipulation of the electoral vote in heavily pro Jefferson Pennsylvania that offset the Southerners  electoral advantage  Take away that manipulation  and Jefferson would have won with or without the extra Southern votes The early president most helped by the Constitution s rejection of direct popular election was John Quincy Adams  later an antislavery hero  who won the White House in 1824 25 despite losing both the popular and electoral votes to Andrew Jackson   The House decided that election   As president  the slaveholder Jackson became one of American history s most prominent critics of the Electoral College  which he blasted for disallowing the people  to express their own will   The Electoral College system made no difference in deciding the presidency during the 36 years before the Civil War There are ample grounds for criticizing the Constitution s provisions for electing the president  That the system enabled the election in 2016 of precisely the kind of demagogic figure the framers designed the system to block suggests the framework may need serious repair  But the myth that the Electoral College began as a slaveholders  instrument needs debunking   which I hope to help with in my book s revised paperback Read

Is Israel ready for a changing of the guard The outcome of Tuesday s parliamentary election will determine whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party will continue to lead the country  Mr  Netanyahu  who has been embroiled by corruption allegations  continues to be seen by many Israeli Jews as critical to their country s future security  But he s facing a strong challenge from the newly formed Blue and White party  led by the former military chief Benny Gantz  Israel uses a parliamentary system in which many parties jockey for votes  Even if Mr  Netanyahu s Likud wins fewer seats than Mr  Gantz s party  he may be better positioned to form a governing coalition by working with conservative parties  Read more about Israel s political parties and the election process here  We asked Israeli citizens how they plan to vote and which issues matter most to them  Though we sought feedback from citizens of all backgrounds  and reached out in English and Arabic  our 200 responses were overwhelmingly from Jews  perhaps because many of Israel s nearly two million Arab citizens plan to boycott the election  Many said they had chosen Likud or Blue and White  and listed

recent clashes between Israel and Hamas along the Gaza border have been deadly  Palestinians in the West Bank  Gaza and East Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote on Tuesday  Chana Selmon

takes a more sober  realistic approach to the conflict with the Palestinians  His background as the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff certainly helps  but he seems to grasp the more diplomatic aspects of being a head of state as well He advocates smaller steps that could improve lives on all sides while keeping in mind the ultimate goal of two states  without simply paying lip service to a lofty ideal Seraj Assi  WashingtonI m boycotting the election  As a Palestinian citizen of Israel  I have no reason to be optimistic about my future in the country  If by simply exercising my basic democratic right to vote  I am posing a threat to Israel s political order  as Netanyahu has constantly hinted  then I can only imagine where my struggle for equal rights stands right now  What s more  Arabs will have no say in the new government  regardless of who wins  All major party  Jewish  leaders said they will not invite Arab parties to join a government coalition  That explains why many Arabs are boycotting  with reasons ranging from racism and discrimination to lack of faith in both Arab parties and Israel s democracy  Hanan Cohen  Beit ShemeshI am Jewish  The Arab citizens in

allegations against Netanyahu are serious but have been way overblown by the media  Likud has a deep bench of experienced leaders who can certainly hold the reins if Netanyahu is sidelined Jonathan Mosery  ModiinI plan on voting for Benny Gantz Netanyahu has been in power too long  He has done great work and will undoubtedly be remembered as one of Israel s top prime ministers and central to Israel s emergence as an economic powerhouse and regional power  but power corrupts  Whether or not the allegations about Netanyahu are true  he has held the reins too long and become obsessed with holding on as long as possible  rather than putting the country s needs first Stav Cohen  RehovotNetanyahu cares so deeply about Israel  In a time where we feel like the world despises our every move  we need him to remain in office I obviously don t approve of his scandals  but I love him as our prime minister The EconomyIsrael s economy and tech sector have grown steadily under Mr  Netanyahu  and

four rounds  and with each passing year it becomes clear that his main interest is lining his pockets I am primarily concerned about the financial and social issues that affect my family  The cost of living is too high  especially in Jerusalem  and one day I would like to be able to afford to buy rather than rent  As a single mother  it is sometimes difficult to imagine thriving financially  rather than just surviving Shimon Zlotnick  ModiinI will be voting for Kulanu because its focus is not only on security  but more important on issues that face Israel every day  such as rising costs

JERUSALEM   Partial election results showed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on course to win a fifth term in office on Wednesday  despite a victory claim from his main rival  according to Haaretz newspaper With 64 percent of the votes counted  Netanyahu was forecast to take 38 of Israel s 120 Knesset seats  against 35 predicted for centrist Blue and White  headed by Netanyahu s rival  former general Benny Gantz  The partial results strengthened Netanyahu s position compared with the early exit polls that were published immediately after voting ended on Tuesday night    Reporting by Maayan Lubell  Editing by Sonya Hepinstall  

JERUSALEM   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re election on Wednesday  with religious rightist parties set to hand him a parliamentary majority and his main challenger conceding defeat With more than 99 percent of votes counted   ballots cast by soldiers at military bases will be tallied over the next two days   Netanyahu s conservative Likud party looked likely to muster enough support to control 65 of the Knesset s 120 seats and be named to head the next coalition government It would be Netanyahu s record fifth term as premier In a televised statement  Yair Lapid  number two in the centrist Blue and White party led by former general Benny Gantz  said   We didn t win in this round  We will make Likud s life hell in the opposition  U S  President Donald Trump  who Netanyahu featured on campaign billboards to highlight their close relationship  phoned to congratulate him on his re election  the Israeli leader said  adding that he thanked his American ally for  tremendous support for Israel  Netanyahu tweeted that Trump had called him from Air Force One  The president was on a flight to Texas Trump told reporters at the White House that Netanyahu s re election improved the chances of peace between Israel and the Palestinians   He s been a great ally and he s a friend  I d like to congratulate him on a well thought out race  A team led by Trump s adviser and son in law Jared Kushner has been working on an Israeli Palestinian peace plan  but it has not disclosed details  Palestinians  angered by what they see as Trump s pro Israel bias  have called it a non starter Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said on Twitter he would begin meeting next week with political parties that won parliamentary seats to hear who they support for prime minister At the sessions  which Rivlin said would be broadcast live  to ensure transparency   he will then pick a party leader to try to form a coalition  giving the candidate 28 days to do so  with a two week extension if needed The close and often vitriolic contest was widely seen in Israel as a referendum on Netanyahu s character and record in the face of corruption allegations  He faces possible indictment in three graft cases  and has denied wrongdoing in all of them Despite that  Netanyahu gained four seats compared to his outgoing coalition government  according to a spreadsheet published by the Central Elections Committee of parties that garnered enough votes to enter the next parliament   It is a night of colossal victory   the 69 year old Netanyahu told cheering supporters in a late night speech at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv after Tuesday s vote   He s a magician   the crowd chanted as fireworks flared and Netanyahu kissed his wife Sara  Earlier that night  Gantz had claimed

Netanyahu can be expected to argue he should be spared in the national interest  Some analysts predict he may try to pass a law granting himself immunity  as a sitting leader  from trial During the campaign  the rival parties accused each other of corruption  fostering bigotry and being soft on security Israel s 21 percent Arab minority saw its parties lose seats  Voters blamed divisions between

their vote will have an impact   he said During the campaign  Netanyahu sought to tap into Trump s popularity among Israelis  who delighted in his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital in 2017 and transfer of the U S  Embassy to the holy city last May from Tel Aviv  Two weeks before the election  Trump signed a proclamation  with Netanyahu at his side at the White House  recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war In a rare turn during the race toward the Israeli Palestinian conflict  Netanyahu further alarmed Palestinians by pledging to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re elected  Palestinians seek a state there and in the Gaza Strip  with East Jerusalem as its capital This pre election promise from Netanyahu was widely seen as an attempt to draw right wing votes rather than a change of policy  But with Trump s moves on Jerusalem and the Golan  the prime minister may feel emboldened to advocate annexation  Commenting on the election  Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said   Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo  They have said no to peace and yes to the occupation  The last round of U S  brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014  Trump is expected to release his administration s Middle East peace plan after the election  If it includes Israeli concessions to the Palestinians  Netanyahu s probable far right coalition allies will probably object    Additional reporting by Dan Williams  Ron Bousso and Maayan

in Morecambe Bay in northwest England  braving the salty shallows of an unusually warm February dawn  He was comparing old mechanical tractors to the more modern electronic kind  and I was well aware of what he was talking about  The tide here comes in fast  If you re not careful  it can swamp a vehicle  So you want be certain to get off that seabed McClure 39  was one of the first people I met on a February March assignment around England s coastline  where I was photographing and talking to people who had voted to leave the European Union Like most of the 50 or so people I met and spoke to while traveling from Morecambe to St  Agnes in Cornwall  McClure wants Britain to get out of the EU  Most spoke as if they felt tricked by Brussels and trapped in a world that was turning against them

who voted Leave  I d embarked on the journey because  looking at the UK from Ireland  I d noticed something about the coastal areas  The overall result of the 2016 referendum on leaving the EU was tight  51 89 percent voted Leave versus 48 11 percent Remain   but on the coast  the Leave vote had been particularly strong   Leave won a majority in more than 100 of about 120 parliamentary constituencies with a coastline  I wanted to know more about the people who delivered that result  The trip was a revelation  First  people were often surprised to be asked their views  saying they felt they weren t important enough for anyone in London to ask  People plied me with tea  biscuits and sandwiches  took me on tractor rides and to the bingo and made a few jokey marriage proposals  Most said they still wanted to get out of Europe Their reasons were more individual and varied than I expected  Some wanted to revive a nostalgic rosy past or keep immigrants out  Some thought they were taking back control  some wanted an end to the EU bureaucracy that they saw hurting their livelihoods and some   like a cockle picker in Flookburgh   thought it was time London paid attention to smaller voices But others had more concrete goals  A grandmother in Skegness hoped that the decline of her town   designated the  most deprived seaside area in Britain  in a study by the Office for National Statistics in 2013   might be slowed down if taxpayers  funds stopped heading to Europe  And people like fisherwoman Margaret Owen wanted better leaders  We need to stand on our own two feet  we re a capable country   she said   The people that we trusted in and that we voted for  and that we thought could carry our hopes and dreams through  have let the whole country down  Among the few

LONDON   The United Kingdom has lost  6 6 billion in economic activity every quarter since it voted to leave the European Union  according to S P Global Ratings  the latest company to estimate the damage from Brexit In a report published on Thursday  the ratings agency s senior economist  Boris Glass  said the world s fifth biggest economy would have been about 3 percent larger by the end of 2018 if the country had not voted in a June 2016 referendum to leave the EU Quarterly growth rates would have averaged about 0 7 percent  rather than 0 43 percent  he said  Immediately after the referendum  the pound fell by about 18 percent  This was the single most pertinent indicator of the impact of the vote and the drag it created  via inflation  has been spreading through the economy   he said As imports became more expensive  inflation started to rise  curbing household spending  S P estimated inflation was 1 8 percent higher than it would otherwise have been by the third quarter 2017 The estimate is slightly lower than an assessment by Goldman Sachs earlier this week  which pegged the cost to the economy at about 600 million pounds per week  That equates to 7 8 billion pounds a quarter  according to Reuters calculations  The S P report was based on the Doppelganger approach  an econometric technique that used a synthetic UK economy based on the performance of other economies to estimate how the UK would have performed had it not decided to leave the EU The other countries included the United States  Canada  Japan  Ireland  Denmark  Portugal and Hungary   Reporting by Josephine Mason  editing by Gareth Jones  Larry King  

IOWA CITY  Iowa   It was hard to miss Cheri Pichone s excitement about Bernie Sanders  second presidential run  She showed up to a recent Iowa rally decked out in Sanders gear  complete with a figurine of the Vermont senator and progressive icon But underneath her exuberance  the 36 year old was still mad about the last Democratic primary  when Sanders  bid for the presidency fell short to Hillary Clinton  They cheated   she said  directing much of her anger at the Democratic National Committee  The party establishment  she lamented  was  actively working against us  Pichone voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein in 2016 and said she may vote for a third party again if Sanders doesn t clinch the nomination She s emblematic of a persistent group of Sanders supporters who won t let go of the slights   real and perceived   from the last campaign  The frustration is notable now that Sanders is a 2020 front runner  raking in  18 2 million in the first quarter  downplaying concerns about DNC bias and highlighting his success in bringing the party around on liberal policies it once resisted Some establishment aligned Democrats worry the party could lose in 2020 if lingering concerns about the last primary aren t put to bed  It has the potential to escalate  and it has the potential to help re elect Donald Trump   said Mo Elleithee  a former spokesman for Clinton and the DNC The acrimony stems from a fiercely fought campaign and a sense among Sanders loyalists that party leaders privately favored Clinton  DNC leaders at the time scheduled fewer debates than Republicans and sometimes slated them for nights with low television viewership  Often opaque delegate allocation rules also contributed to a belief among some Sanders supporters that the primary was essentially rigged According to data from the Pew Research Center  the tension took a toll  About 81  of people who consistently supported Sanders during the primary season and were confirmed to have voted in the general election said they ultimately voted for Clinton  while 11  said they supported Stein or Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson  and 3  supported Trump In a closely contested election  those moves away from Clinton may have factored into the results Since the election  party leaders have sought to smooth things over with Sanders and his supporters  DNC Chairman Tom Perez is planning a robust debate schedule  The rules governing superdelegates   party insiders who overwhelmingly backed Clinton   have changed Sanders has publicly expressed confidence in the process this time around  but in terms that suggest he won t soon forget 2016  In 2016  I think I will not shock anybody to suggest that the DNC was not quite evenhanded   he said during a CNN town hall in February   I think we have come a long way since then  and I fully expect to be treated quite as well as anybody else  In an interview Friday  Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir echoed that optimism  If you re talking to anyone at the Democratic National Committee who s there now  I m sure they will tell you that their relationship with the Bernie Sanders campaign is great and that we are operating in good faith and we are talking to each other on an almost daily basis   he said   Anyone suggesting that there s any kind of friction there is living in the past  They are living with some grudges that they are holding onto from a bygone time  Still  the campaign has made some moves that raise questions about whether resentments from 2016 will linger  Briahna Joy Gray  formerly a liberal journalist who voted for Stein  is Sanders  national press secretary  Nina Turner  who called the DNC  dictatorial and pompous  in 2017  is one of his national campaign chairs And some of Sanders  most loyal supporters in the crucial early voting states say they re not ready to fully move on Nicholas Shaw  a 39 year old from Concord  New Hampshire  spent his recent birthday watching Sanders speak  Like Pichone  he said he wouldn t support the Democratic nominee if it s anyone other than Sanders  If they steal it from him again  I ll go independent or something other than that   he said   The Democratic Party s on their last edge of me if they kind of try to screw him again  Even in South Carolina  where Sanders lost momentum after a 47 point drubbing from Clinton  some supporters are still smarting over a process they believe was rigged  Lost might be a stretch   said Tom Amon  of Summerville  when asked how he felt about Sanders  ability to perform better in South Carolina than he did in the 2016 primary   It was stolen from him     Woodall reported from Manchester  New Hampshire  and Kinnard reported from North Charleston  South Carolina  Associated Press writer Juana Summers in Davenport  Iowa  contributed to this report    This story has been corrected to reflect that Sanders  campaign manager is Faiz Shakir  not Fiaz Shakir

FRANKFURT   One of Bayer s largest shareholders tore into the company s management on Wednesday for underestimating the legal risks of its takeover of Monsanto  setting the stage for a fiery annual general meeting after a 30 percent plunge in the shares  Bayer has seen about 30 billion euros   34 billion  wiped off its market value since August  when a U S  jury found Bayer liable because Monsanto had not warned of weedkiller Roundup s alleged cancer risks  It suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month  It s quite drastic when a takeover triggers such value destruction and reputational damage so quickly  There can be no talk of a successful takeover any more   Ingo Speich  the head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment  told Reuters  He will be among the shareholders to speak at the April 26 annual general meeting  AGM   What s startling is that things have effectively moved beyond management s control because we re now at a point where the decisions over future development are made in court rooms   he said  adding Bayer had clearly underestimated the risks  With a holding of about 1 percent  Deka says it is Bayer s 10th largest shareholder overall  and the second largest German one after DWS Major shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services  ISS  and Glass Lewis last week recommended investors not to give the executive board their seal of approval at the AGM  Glass Lewis also advised against a vote of approval for the non executive supervisory board  A shareholder vote to ratify boards  actions features prominently at every German AGM  Though largely symbolic  as it has no bearing on management liability  it is seen as a key gauge of shareholder sentiment Among shareholders that have vowed to deny top Bayer executives their vote of confidence is the former head of DWS  Christian Strenger  Deka s Speich declined to disclose how Deka would vote Company filings showed this week that Bayer s supervisory board sought law firm Linklaters  expert opinion for reassurance that the management board had complied with its duties when acquiring Monsanto for  63 billion last year The supervisory board in Germany s two tier corporate board system has to sign off on larger transactions  Bayer s non executive Chairman Werner Wenning was a driving force of the Monsanto deal  according to sources familiar with the matter Bayer is appealing  or has vowed to appeal  the two jury verdicts  but more than 11 000 plaintiffs are seeking damages The U S  Environmental Protection Agency  the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators across the globe have found that glyphosate  the active ingredient in Roundup  is not likely carcinogenic to humans However  the World Health Organization s cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion  classifying glyphosate as  probably carcinogenic to humans  Speich said Bayer could now be vulnerable to attacks from activist shareholders who might seek to break it up  although the  bitter pill  of litigation risks might deter them for now  Such risks could also distract management  he added  when it  should be fully absorbed by the integration of Monsanto   Speich said    Reporting by Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss  Editing by Edward Taylor and Mark Potter  

Israel s parliamentary election on Tuesday brings an end to a neck and neck campaign that saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  the veteran politician of the Israeli right and one of the country s longest serving leaders  facing the strongest challenge in years  Mr  Netanyahu s tenure has been marked by a collapse of peace talks with the Palestinians  confrontation with Iran  armed conflict with Hamas  and hostility toward what he views as plots to isolate and delegitimize the Jewish state But Mr  Netanyahu has also overseen an era of healthy economic growth and stability  thawed relations with Sunni Arab leaders and expanded Israeli trade ties in Africa  Latin America and Asia   Read more on Mr  Netanyahu s ties with President Trump that have emboldened him to take policy risks  The prime minister is entangled in corruption scandals that could lead to his indictment  And he faces stiff competition from a new rival  Benny Gantz  the leader of a trio of former generals who could end Mr  Netanyahu s 10 uninterrupted years as prime minister But Israeli elections are complicated and unpredictable  with many parties vying for votes and at times forming opportunistic alliances to secure a parliamentary majority ImageThe Blue and White alliance is led by Benny Gantz  center  and two other veteran generals  They have teamed up with a centrist party led by Yair Lapid  left  a former television host and finance minister CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWho are the main challengers to Netanyahu Final pre election polls showed Mr  Gantz s centrist Blue and White alliance  a coalition named for the colors of the Israeli flag  slightly ahead of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  a dominant force on the Israeli right for decades Their policy stances are similar  a reflection of how Israeli politics have moved increasingly to the right under Mr  Netanyahu  But while Mr  Gantz has sought allies from across the spectrum  Mr  Netanyahu has reached out to the far right to strengthen his prospects for a parliamentary majority  He even has promised to begin extending sovereignty over the occupied West Bank  which the Palestinians want for a future state  if he is re elected The Blue and White leaders are drawing on their military backgrounds to counter Mr  Netanyahu s contention that only he can protect Israel  Mr  Gantz and his colleagues have also focused on the corruption accusations against Mr  Netanyahu  his biggest vulnerability  to press their case that new leadership is needed They have attracted backing from smaller centrist parties  And what remains of the left leaning opposition has thrown its support behind Mr  Gantz for prime minister  The Labor Party would be likely to recommend Mr  Gantz for the premiership after the election What makes this election different Mr  Netanyahu could be indicted  Israel s attorney general announced last month that he planned to bring charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  A final decision on charges is likely by year s end  Under the current law  Mr  Netanyahu  if re elected  would not have to resign until a final conviction  although new legislation or public pressure could force him to step down  Mr  Netanyahu has described the charges as a baseless partisan witch hunt  But with a first sitting prime minister to be charged  Israel would be entering uncharted legal and political terrain The uncertainty has worked against Mr  Netanyahu in the prelude to the vote   The attorney general s report has done something that has never happened in Israel s 70 year history  and that is that a prime minister is under a legal cloud   said David Makovsky  an expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  The election also is the first time that three former heads of the army  the Israel Defense Forces  have united to run for office  The Blue and White alliance is led by Mr  Gantz and two other veteran generals  Gabi Ashkenazi and Moshe Yaalon They have teamed up with a well known centrist party  Yesh Atid  led by Yair Lapid  a former journalist  television host and finance minister  Mr  Gantz has agreed to hand off the prime minister position to Mr  Lapid after two and a half years if their parties win  While Mr  Netanyahu has a strong record of defending Israel  the Blue and White alliance s military credentials have made it more difficult for him to attack Mr  Gantz and his colleagues as weak on security   The question is  will it neutralize the advantage that Netanyahu has accrued over his previous four terms of being  Mr  Security    Mr  Makovsky said   He s said the words Israelis want to hear   I ll keep you safe    How does the voting work Voters cast ballots for parties  not individual candidates  to fill seats in the 120 member Knesset  or Parliament  The seats are divided proportionally based on the percentage of the vote each party receives  Any party that wins 3 25 percent or more of the vote gets at least one seat  If parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes won t be counted  That will raise the share of seats given to the other parties  If one party were to win at least 61 seats  it would be entitled to form a government  But this has never happened in Israeli politics  So once the seats have been apportioned  parties try to cobble together coalitions that control a majority of seats  ImageAn election billboard for the New Right party  with which Likud is expected to align CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat might those alliances look like Polls have suggested that Likud and Blue and White will each get about 30 seats   meaning both will be seeking alliances with smaller parties  Likud is expected to align with a  right wing party known as the New Right  and with an extreme right alliance known as the Union of Right Wing Parties  which includes Jewish Power  widely criticized as an extremist  anti Arab racist party  Potential Blue and White coalition partners include the Labor Party and the leftist Meretz Party  among others  Read about the Palestinian rapper who is  urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes by boycotting the elections  Will the outcome of the vote be clear immediately Probably not  The president  Reuven Rivlin  has the discretion to give the party leader with the best chance of forming a majority coalition the first opportunity  Typically  but not always  that opportunity goes to the leader of the party with the most votes  who then has 42 days to try  If that party leader fails  the president turns to another to attempt to create a coalition  So it could take a few months It also is possible that the Likud and the Blue and White coalition would join forces and create a national unity government  In theory  Mr  Rivlin could offer both Mr  Gantz and Mr  Netanyahu this opportunity and they could take turns as prime minister Mr  Gantz has rejected that idea  vowing that he will not sit on a government with Mr

Israel They represent nearly a fifth of the country s 5 8 million eligible voters  which could give the four Israeli Arab parties a potential kingmaker role  But these parties have never joined a governing coalition in Israel  And some Israeli Arab voters have vowed to boycott the election  partly in protest of a new law pushed by Mr  Netanyahu declaring Israel as the  nation state of the Jewish people   Critics have called the law racist and undemocratic What about Palestinians in occupied territory They are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote in the election  About 4 75 million Palestinians fall into this category  according to the Institute for Middle East Understanding  an American nonprofit educational group that promotes Palestinian viewpoints Could the election affect a potential peace plan Still steeped in secrecy  President Trump s long anticipated plan to resolve the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is not much of an issue in the election  Nevertheless  it could be affected Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law  who has been leading the administration s efforts to draft the plan  said it would not be made public until after the election Many Palestinians already have dismissed the plan   whatever it may contain   because they see Mr  Trump as siding with Israel  But the plan also faces a threat from the parties of the Israeli extreme right  which see any concessions to the Palestinians as unacceptable  If Mr  Netanyahu needs those parties to form a coalition  Mr  Trump s peace plan may be doomed However  if Blue and White wins or forms a national unity government with Likud  that could make way for possible cooperation with the Trump administration on a plan  David M  Halbfinger  Isabel Kershner and Herbert Buchsbaum

We ve ended this live briefing for the night  We will have another one on Wednesday  Here s what happened today   Exit polls show a dead heat in the race between Benjamin Netanyahu  the polarizing  right wing prime minister  and his main rival  Benny Gantz  a newcomer to electoral politics who is seen as a centrist  Both men claimed victory  Who is Benny Gantz    Official results may not come until early morning Israel time  late tonight in the U S  It will then be up to President Reuven Rivlin to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority   Regardless of who becomes the next prime minister  the election has already proven to be a humbling setback for Mr  Netanyahu  69  who has built a strong economy  kept the country safe and has been promoted by President Trump  It has also placed Mr  Gantz s new Blue and White party in the position of the main alternative to the right wing  a spot once held by the Labor party   While Mr  Netanyahu appealed primarily to the right  Mr  Gantz  59  a retired lieutenant general and former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces  reached out for allies across the political spectrum  He sought to make Mr  Netanyahu s expected indictment on corruption charges the main issue ImageBenny Gantz  the leader of the Blue and White alliance  speaking on Tuesday night at headquarters in Tel Aviv CreditCorinna Kern ReutersExit polls show Netanyahu and Gantz in dead heat  both claim victoryMr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz emerged in a dead heat in Tuesday s parliamentary election  according to preliminary exit polls The muddled projected outcome left Israel teetering at a critical juncture between an ever sharper turn to the right or a more moderate reset of the political order The exit polls of the three main television channels were sufficiently disparate that both sides claimed victory In a head to head matchup  two of the polls showed Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party ahead and a third showed him in a draw with Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  But including the broader blocs supporting each party  two polls showed the Likud bloc ahead and the third was a draw Just after midnight  Mr  Gantz made a triumphant entrance at his party headquarters to the cheers and chants of supporters  and gave a victory speech even though victory was not assured Calling it  a historic day   Mr  Gantz declared   We are the winners   and thanked Mr  Netanyahu for his years of service Mr  Netanyahu  for his part  claimed a  definite victory  for the right wing bloc in Parliament   I thank the citizens of Israel for their trust   he wrote on Twitter   I will start by assembling a right wing government with our natural partners tonight  ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel with his wife  Sara  speaking to supporters at his Likud party headquarters on Tuesday night CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesStill  Mr  Gantz s strong performance against the long dominant Mr  Netanyahu was a remarkable achievement for a political newcomer  and the mood at Likud headquarters was grim  We need to wait for the most important poll  the real election   Amir Ohana  a member of Parliament  said at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv The results may become clearer as vote counting progresses in the coming hours  It is also possible that the result could still be tipped by the final count  including the votes of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients  later this week Smaller parties could prove decisiveThe fate of smaller parties at both ends of the spectrum was unclear and could prove decisive The pro settler New Right party  led by Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked  failed to cross the threshold to be seated in Parliament  according to two of the three television networks  exit polls But the third survey showed it with four seats  We passed a three month marathon and the marathon is still going on   Mr  Bennett told supporters  urging them to keep their spirits up and look to the counting of military ballots   We have patience  great faith and nerves of steel  We take care of the soldiers  and the soldiers will take care of us  At the far left  Raam Balad  the weaker of two Arab dominated parties  failed to cross the threshold in two exit polls  but won six seats in the third survey If one or both of those parties is able to win seats in the Parliament when all the votes are counted  those extra seats could swing the determination of the winning coalition and thus the next prime minister When will we get official results ImageSupporters of the Blue and White political alliance watching exit poll results at party headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditLior Mizrahi Getty ImagesThe manual ballot counting was expected to continue until at least 3 a m  Israel time  8 p m  Eastern   and possibly hours later  By Wednesday morning  the Central Elections Committee should release close to final results based on some 99 percent of the polls The action will then shift to the official residence of President Reuven Rivlin  He will receive a parade of party representatives over the next few days who will lobby for their choices for the next prime minister  Mr  Rivlin will then ask the candidate he thinks has the best chance of forming a government to do so That candidate will have 42 days to try to forge a coalition with the support of at least 61 seats in the 120 seat Parliament In most cases  the party with the largest number of seats is given first crack at forming a government  In 2009  Tzipi Livni s Kadima party won the most votes but failed to build a viable coalition  Mr  Netanyahu  whose Likud party came in second  was tasked with forming the government Mr  Netanyahu was already busy on Tuesday night trying to secure recommendations and support from his so called  natural partners  among the right wing and religious parties A caveat on exit pollsThe final outcome was likely to be swayed by several small parties that were teetering just above or below the electoral threshold  according to the exit polls  Avigdor Lieberman  the leader of one such party  the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu  said it was  too early to draw conclusions  The exit polls of the 2015 election serve as a cautionary tale  They anticipated a tie between Likud and the center left Zionist Union  with most projecting 27 seats for each  In the final count  Likud prevailed with 30 seats and the Zionist Union won only 24 In another variable on Tuesday  the exit polls may not have fully accounted for what appeared to be a late surge in the number of Arab voters The Arab vote headed for historic lowImageTurnout in Arab areas of Israel appeared to be headed for a historic low CreditAtef Safadi EPA  via ShutterstockPolitical analysts said the turnout in Arab areas of Israel  where citizens have become disillusioned with Israeli politics and with their own politicians  appeared to be headed for a historic low With turnout lagging and the fate of the election potentially swinging on one or two seats in a coalition  every party was pleading with its voters to race to the polls before it was too late But among Arab voters  where a boycott movement appeared to be having a strong effect  the haranguing was especially intense  The right is planning to crush the Arab parties  it wants to erase us off the political arena   Mtanes Shehadeh  a spokesman for the struggling Ram Balad party  wrote in a WhatsApp message to supporters   This is Netanyahu s dream  Palestinian groups were critical of the early results  Saeb Erekat  the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its chief negotiator  said exit polls suggested that  Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo  they have said  no  to peace and  yes  to the occupation  Just days ago  Mr  Netanyahu unexpectedly promised to begin extending Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank if re elected  The move would probably doom a two state solution and appeared to be a last ditch effort to rally his right wing base Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party has come out against the idea of annexing West Bank settlements  but it has been vague about allowing a Palestinian state alongside Israel Netanyahu s party places hidden cameras at Arab pollsA boycott campaign wasn t the only reason for poor turnout among Arab voters  Early Tuesday  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling places in Arab towns At least some of the Likud observers concealed the cameras  as online videos showed  Likud said the move was aimed at capturing evidence of any irregularities According to Israeli news reports  the Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint  calling it voter intimidation  the police confiscated dozens of the cameras  and the Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said filming in polling stations was prohibited Just before 9 p m   the left wing party Meretz  which was counting on Arab support to clear the threshold to be seated in Parliament  appealed to elections officials to keep the polls open in Arab villages an extra hour to allow in any voters who had initially been scared off by the cameras How it worksVoters cast ballots for parties  not candidates  Thirty nine parties are participating  The percentage of the vote determines a party s number of seats in the Knesset  or Parliament  Any party needs at least 3 25 percent of the vote for a seat Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and Mr  Gantz s Blue and White alliance are expected to gain more seats than any other group  But each will fall far short of achieving a 61 seat majority on its own  meaning that a new government will almost certainly be formed by a multiparty coalition  See our guide to the Israeli elections  Possible outcomesImageA poster of the Blue and White party leaders in Tel Aviv  depicting from left  Moshe Yaalon  Benny Gantz  Yair Lapid and Gabi Ashkenazi CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesLikud wins the most seats  Mr  Netanyahu s party might be able to reach a majority with the help of smaller right wing parties Blue and White wins the most seats  Mr  Gantz and his partners might be able to reach a majority with a combination of smaller parties on the left and right Unity government of Likud plus Blue and White  While Mr  Gantz has vowed never to serve in a government led by Mr  Netanyahu  there has been speculation that their parties might negotiate to form a unity government if neither can attain the sufficient number of seats  Such a possibility would increase if some smaller parties needed by Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz fail to make the 3 25 percent threshold Any party that wins at least 3 25 percent of the vote gets at least three seats in Parliament  but if parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes are discarded  

SKEGNESS  England   On a Sunday evening in March  Evelyn Ovington and her granddaughter Dana Marie went to play bingo as usual in their local town hall near Skegness  a resort on the east coast of England  Like many of the country s seaside towns  it is battling decline and voted heavily to quit the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum Top prizes at the club that night included the ingredients for a chicken dinner  Dana Marie  who had just turned 18  marked her coming of age by drinking a can of beer  She and her 59 year old gran joked with the rest of the crowd  spanning all ages  as they waited for the numbers to be called in the traditional way  When the caller said   The street where she lives  Theresa May   the players recognized the reference to the prime minister s residence in Downing Street  Number 10 But bingo calls are about as close as Evelyn Ovington expects to get to Theresa May  As the target deadline for Britain to quit the EU approached  Ovington and dozens of others whom Reuters met on a 14 day tour along England s coastline said they felt increasingly let down by politicians  In line with recent opinion polls nationwide  few had changed their minds about backing Brexit  In these coastal areas  the majority still wanted to leave Europe  Get us out of there and get us our own nation back  That s what I say   said Ovington    I m  just fed up with all the money that they give to the EU when we can spend it here  I want out  Britain as a whole voted by a narrow margin to leave the European Union  But around England s coastline  dislike of EU was and is much more marked  A tally of the results as estimated by Chris Hanretty  a professor of politics at Royal Holloway  University of London  shows more than 100 of the 120 or so English parliamentary constituencies that have a coastline voted to leave  Reuters visited 10 of them  eight where most people voted to leave  and two where a majority chose to stay  From Skegness on the east coast to Morecambe Bay in the west  dozens of people said they were still convinced their fortunes could only improve outside the EU The main exception was Brighton  a southern town nicknamed  London on Sea   partly for its appeal to those with jobs in the capital who have an hour long commute to work  In this cosmopolitan  affluent university town  a clear majority voted to remain in the European community  which the UK joined in 1973 The overall results reflect a wider trend  Across Europe  economic and industrial decline are driving anti EU sentiment  according to a European Commission study from December 2018  The paper   The Geography of EU Discontent   found that areas with lower employment or a less educated workforce are more likely to vote anti EU In England s case  Brexit also highlights a new layer in the political divide  which Prime Minister May alluded to in 2016 when she pledged to help those  left behind  by globalisation  Big cities are becoming younger  more ethnically diverse  more educated and more socially liberal  while smaller towns are ageing  are less diverse  more nostalgic and more socially conservative  studies by political geographers show All around the coastline  whether people voted Leave or Remain  they expressed nostalgic regret for a time when there was more opportunity   and kindness   I think we used to take care of our communities a bit more   said Brighton based web designer and massage therapist Chris Baker  adding it was easy to be too romantic about the past   I think  you know  we had more manners  we were nicer to people on the street  For Ovington  the problem is very real  She worries that her granddaughter s 18th birthday brings nearer the moment when Dana Marie  like other young people in the region  will move away to university and work Ovington hopes Brexit means the local council can claim funds that in her view are currently being mis directed into Europe  and invest them in a future for local young people   At the moment there is no future for them  there s nothing   she said   So out of Brexit  they ll get more funding  help the kids more  SKEGNESS  LINCOLNSHIRECoastal regions were targeted in the run up to the referendum by the anti EU United Kingdom Independence Party  UKIP   While UKIP has since lost ground  the frustrations it tapped remain Populations on the coast are typically older  whiter  less well educated and poorer than the average  In 2013  Skegness was designated the  most deprived seaside area in Britain  in a study by the Office for National Statistics  ONS   And in 2016 the constituency returned the biggest  Leave  vote in the country  at more than 75 percent  according to Hanretty Skegness was the site of the first Butlin s holiday camp for workers in the 1930s  and is still a popular seaside destination in the summer  But it sits in a poor farming region and has yet to attract year round visitors The mean age of just over 44 in Skegness is older than the English average of just over 39  census data from 2011 shows  More than 93 percent of people in the area said they were white and of English or British nationalities  compared with just under 80 percent in England on average  Around 40 percent of people in the Skegness area said they had no qualifications  It s been going downhill for a long time   said Dana Marie of the town  adding she would have voted to leave the EU if she had been old enough  She is studying biology  sociology and health and social care at school  and works part time in a Burger King   Obviously it s seasonal  so during the summer it s really really good  but during the winter it s terrible  In 2010  average hourly pay for people living in the Skegness area was about three quarters of the British average  By 2018  it had fallen further behind  The national average was 14 36 pounds an hour  according to the ONS  But people living in and around Skegness were making just over 10 pounds an hour On a Sunday night in a pub in Wainfleet near Skegness  father and son John and Andrew Eldin were almost the only customers  John  77  said that to stay in Europe would be to be  ruled by a load of boneheads  I voted out  Because I remembered how good it was before we went in  Eldin and his son  a heavy goods driver and mechanic  spoke heatedly about how there has been diminishing care for old farm hands in the region who have been afflicted by arthritis after years harvesting cabbages  Now  they said  locals are undermined in the jobs market by immigrants from eastern Europe who have freedom of access  and also compete for schools and healthcare REDCAR  NORTH YORKSHIREA militant mood is mounting in Redcar  a small town devastated in 2015 by the closure of its steelworks with the loss of around 3 000 jobs  In January  local media reported  demonstrators marched in yellow vests with the slogan  leave means leave  to urge their member of parliament  who backed the Remain campaign  to quit  The politician did not step down and tensions still run high  Life s gonna change after this because of the politicians  who run the country  said Kevin Calvey  an unemployed 64 year old   Everything s gonna be contested from now on  He thinks London is absorbing investment that the rest of the country needs  A new rail link across the capital is costing some  22 billion  The government s refusal to grant a loan to the Redcar steelworks forced the plant to close  Redcar is a relatively young town  but more than a quarter of residents have no qualifications  Relative pay has declined since 2010  London just needs feeding all the time  to the detriment of the rest of the country   said Calvey  He said he voted to leave the EU  because I didn t want the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels telling us what to do   Fish and chip shop owner and Leave voter Mark Scorer works in Redcar because businesses in his home town of Sunderland were too expensive to take on  he said   I just think Britain s been on the decline since the 80s   he said   There s not much out there for people  sometimes people have got to move away to get jobs  They go to university to get these degrees and then they move to London     which is a shame  Further up the coast  a postcard on sale in the former fishing town of Whitby depicted the shuttered hulk of Redcar s steelworks above a banner   dystopia on sea  WHITBY  NORTH YORKSHIREIn Whitby harbor  kipper smoker Derek Brown said his family has been in the business for 146 years  For the past 30 or so  he says  the fish he has been smoking has had to be imported from Norway and Iceland because herring can no longer be found off the coast  The reasons for this include overfishing and climate change  but he felt London and Brussels have not helped When Britain joined the then European Economic Community  the country opened its fishing waters to other states  which today catch more in UK waters than do UK boats   I want change   Brown said   Hopefully we ll get our fishing grounds back  Pay in the Whitby area has picked up since 2010  but still lags the British average  A higher than average share of people say they have no qualifications  and in the 2011 census  97 percent gave their nationalities as white English or British variants Guest house and tea shop owner Alice Raven  27  said she didn t vote in the referendum but she sees more opportunities for England outside the EU  Her gothic themed cafe plays on Whitby s appeal as the site where the 19th century novelist Bram Stoker brought his villain  Count Dracula  into England  I think leaving would be the best option   she said  sitting next to a skeleton outside her tea rooms   I don t think you can trust any of the government at the moment  MORECAMBE  LANCASHIREOn the northwest coast  fisherwoman Margaret Owen  just back from delivering a batch of sprats to feed the seals in Blackpool Zoo  was boiling over at the politicians  ignorance  She said it was preventing her from earning a living In the summer months Owen  66  uses a haaf net  an ancient technique dating back to the Vikings to catch salmon and sea trout as they head upriver  The job is dangerous  Users manipulate a device like a cutdown soccer goal post while standing in deep  fast running water  Owen has until recently been licensed to fish in this traditional way  But now salmon are an endangered species  and from this year she has been told that EU regulations mean she must discard any salmon she catches This  she says  is unrealistic  not least because she sometimes fishes at night  I stand in the water up to my chest   she said   It can be pitch black  turbulent  raining  sand s going from under your feet  You get it  the fish  in the net  it goes right to the back of the net  You ve got to catch it  kill it  and put it on your belt and let me tell you  I haven t got time to say   Are you a sea trout or a salmon   Owen said she originally wanted out of the EU   We were hoping for a change for everybody   But now  she says she has changed her mind  because talks so far don t look like delivering what the fishing industry hoped Other fishermen in Morecambe Bay gather shellfish  such as cockles and mussels  for export  mainly to southern Europe  Leaving could restrict their access to European markets  but two of them said they still wanted out  even though they worried about the potential impact on their business  UK cockle fisheries made over four million pounds in 2017 The EU was originally set up for fair trading  said one of these fishermen  Michael Wilson  but it hasn t worked out like that   We ve countries joining with no money and we were providing money  so it was time to get out or go independent  I think  BRIGHTON  EAST SUSSEXThe Leave vote cuts little ice in Brighton on the south coast  one of the few coastal towns with a clear majority in favor of remaining in Europe  In the wealthier part of town  almost three quarters of voters wanted to stay in Europe  I believe that the Leave campaign was based entirely on lies and there was no way I was going to vote in support of that   said Ruby McMahon  a 22 year old literature graduate who works in a clothing store  She came to Brighton in 2015 to go to university  and said she stayed because she had been raised  in a very conservative backwards town  Brighton s demographic profile is almost the mirror image of Skegness  People who live in the town  which houses the UK headquarters of American Express  earn more than the British average   almost 10 percent more in Brighton Pavilion  the richer part of town  The mean age  at 37  is younger than average  according to the 2011 census  Almost 40 percent are educated to the highest level  and around 20 percent of residents say their ethnicity is not white English or British McMahon   like the Ovingtons in Skegness   said her vote was partly driven by her aspirations for the future But where the Ovingtons want more opportunities at home  McMahon worries that Brexit will damage her chances of living and working outside England  Once outside the European Union  Britons may no longer enjoy freedom of movement  I m scared of how badly handled it s been   she said   Ledwith reported from London  Additional reporting by Michael Holden  Edited by Janet McBride and Richard Woods

Over the last decade  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has repeatedly quashed rivals on the left and the right  defying the odds   and the polls   to hold onto power  He has increasingly relied on right wing partners to do so Yet in nationwide elections Tuesday  he faces an unexpectedly strong challenger  Benny Gantz  a former army chief who has tirelessly reminded voters that Mr  Netanyahu may soon face corruption charges   a planned indictment that would make him the first sitting prime minister in Israel to face criminal prosecution Mr  Netanyahu s future   and his legacy   are not the only things at stake in the election  A potential reshuffling of Israel s chaotic political landscape could have far reaching consequences  Here s a guide to our coverage of the players  issues and possible ramifications of the election The headliners  Mr  Netanyahu  69  has framed himself as Israel s Indispensable Man  the tough ex soldier who has aggressively defended Israel s interests  raising the country s prominence on the world stage  His relentless self promotion and potent politics of division   pitting right against left  Jew against Arab  religious against secular   have helped him dodge past allegations of corruption and build his current coalition  consisting of his Likud party and pro settlement and ultra Orthodox factions ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel visiting the market in Jerusalem while campaigning on Monday CreditDan Balilty for The New York Times  Mr  Gantz  59  is a three star general who fought two wars in Gaza  giving him credentials to challenge Mr  Netanyahu s  Mr  Security  persona  In campaign ads  Mr  Gantz both boasted about  terrorists killed  over his military career and suggested he could be a peacemaker  He teamed up with two other former army chiefs and another centrist  Yair Lapid  to try to court voters in the middle of the ideological spectrum Kingmakers and a political brawl  Under Israel s chaotic and confusing parliamentary system  a panoply of small parties could tip the balance of power  The unlikeliest kingmaker is an iconoclastic politician  Moshe Feiglin  last seen pushing a far right agenda of annexing the entire West Bank  He is now calling for the legalization of marijuana and has put out proposals aimed at reducing the cost of living  a flat tax  privatization of hospitals  an end to import tariffs  and land reform to lower housing costs   The Arab vote is also a wild card   especially as  on the eve of the election  Mr  Netanyahu pledged to begin annexing parts of the West Bank  a potentially fatal blow to the prospects for a peace agreement with Palestinians  A strong turnout among Palestinian citizens of Israel  who make up 20 percent of the population  could raise the number of votes needed to make it into Parliament  jeopardizing smaller parties on the right and the left  Yet Arab voters have seemed even less enthusiastic about voting than Jews  and a boycott the vote campaign has gained strength in the past month   Whoever wins in the electoral contest will have to cobble together a coalition in Parliament  where no party has ever won a 61 seat majority outright  Here s our guide to the factions and system   In the turbulent run up to the vote  parties collapsed  former allies turned on one another and younger Likud leaders prepared for life after Bibi  Election ads reflected the ugly  anything goes tenor of the race  and neither of the front runners said much about policy ImageCampaign posters showing leaders of the Blue and White party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditDan Balilty for The New York Times  A series of unforced errors by Mr  Gantz gave Mr  Netanyahu opportunities to call his fitness for office into question  as did a report on Israeli television that Mr  Gantz s cellphone had been hacked by Iranian intelligence  Mr  Netanyahu also played up President Trump s recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli territory  and his relationship with Mr  Trump   Mr  Gantz  meanwhile  hammered on the allegations of corruption around the prime minister  An Israeli watchdog group found a network of hundreds of social media accounts  many of them fake  were being used to smear Mr  Netanyahu s opponents  Both men seized on Menachem Begin  the former prime minister and militant Zionist  as a campaign prop   27 years after his death The indictment  In February  Israel s attorney general announced his intention to indict Mr  Netanyahu on charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  Mr  Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing  and is entitled to a hearing before an indictment is formally issued   Read more here about the cases against him  the culmination of a two year investigation into his dealings with wealthy businessmen  including a Hollywood movie producer and Israeli newspaper publishers   Mr  Netanyahu is also facing a new scandal  He is accused of secretly approving the sale of advanced submarines to Egypt without the approval of top military officials  and is accused of self dealing  through an undisclosed and enormously profitable financial stake in a company that supplied the German builder of both the Egyptian subs and several new Israeli warships  

ZURICH   Sunrise Communications  top shareholder on Wednesday blocked plans to extend the company s right to issue fresh capital to 2021  complicating its bid to buy Liberty Global s Swiss UPC cable business for  6 3 billion The rejection by Freenet at the Swiss telecoms firm s annual shareholder meeting does not scupper the takeover  which was announced in February A separate meeting will decide on the  4 1 billion capital increase needed to push that through But the thumbs down from German telecoms company Freenet  which holds a 24 5 percent stake  denied Sunrise the required two thirds majority to extend capacity for authorized capital until 2021  The measure got only 59 3 percent support  Together with Freenet we could have agreed it makes sense by pushing forward a  further potential  capital increase to take pressure off the large capital increase   Sunrise finance chief Andre Krause told Reuters  Now we can t do that  Freenet robbed us of optionality  Freenet had already said it would not take part in the main capital hike  saying it was disturbed by how the transaction was structured  It has not yet decided how to vote at the extraordinary shareholder meeting that will be convened to approve that  Freenet lawyer Alexander Borgwardt told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual meeting The date for that meeting   where only a simple majority is needed   has yet to be set pending regulatory approval for the deal Authorizing fresh capital now could have helped contribute some of the money needed for the deal  Borgwardt said  adding   We think this should be voted on at the end  when the entire transaction will be discussed  Sunrise Chairman Peter Kurer said a two thirds majority for the capital increase could be needed should Liberty Global in the meantime buy shares in Sunrise  In that case  it would be easier for Freenet with its nearly one quarter stake to block the capital increase because not all shareholders attend meetings  The turnout on Wednesday  for instance  was 62 percent of the voting capital There was no evidence at this stage that Liberty planned such a move  Krause said Kurer had earlier expressed optimism that Sunrise would win backing to raise the money needed to complete the UPC takeover Sunrise officials have met more than 170 large shareholders and potential investors in recent weeks to outline the deal   After these talks they view the transaction significantly more positively   he said Kurer said he anticipated regulatory approval  adding a rival could well buy UPC should Sunrise fail   Writing by Michael Shields

KIEV   As a comedian  TV host and actor  Volodymyr Zelenskiy knows how to start a show with a bang  He proved that by beating all comers in the first round of Ukraine s presidential election  As he plans for the grand finale  a runoff against President Petro Poroshenko on April 21  aides say he is sticking to an unorthodox campaign routine that has torn up the play book Appearing to turn the tables on Poroshenko  Zelenskiy on Wednesday evening accepted his challenge to take part in a policy debate  In a slick video with pumping music  he set his own conditions and gave his rival 24 hours to respond Poroshenko s campaign team had hinted Zelenskiy would duck out because the comedian  who plays a fictional president in a popular TV series  would risk showing himself up Within 45 minutes of Zelenskiy s video being posted on Facebook  it had been seen 141 000 times  shared more than 22 000 times and attracted 3 300 comments  It left a live countdown for Poroshenko to respond  You called me for a debate  dreaming that I would run away  duck out  hide  No  I m not you in 2014   said Zelenskiy  in a reference to Poroshenko not holding a debate during the previous election five years ago Poroshenko responded with a much more sober video in which he accepted Zelenskiy s condition of holding the debate in a huge soccer stadium  But he cautioned   Debate is not a show     This is no time to joke around  Being a president and commander in chief is not a game   Zelenskiy s response to Poroshenko offered a snapshot of how he has upstaged his more experienced rivals  winning nearly twice as many votes as Poroshenko in the first round of the election on March 31 Shunning traditional campaign tactics such as mass rallies or erecting tents in the street to distribute leaflets  he has relied heavily on social media and comedy gigs where he pokes fun at rivals  presenting himself as an everyman who stands up to corrupt elites    a man to whom Ukrainians can relate At stake is the leadership of a country on the frontline of the West s standoff with Russia following the 2014 annexation of the Crimea peninsula and war in eastern Ukraine against Russia backed separatists in which 13 000 people have been killed  NOT AFRAID TO BE CREATIVE Part of Zelenskiy s campaign team works in a large house in an upscale area of the capital  Kiev  Inside  the offices have glass walls with messages scrawled on them and are filled with volunteers in their twenties bent over laptops  All that we do is to not be like everyone else   said 28 year old Michael Fedorov  whose team manages various Facebook  YouTube and Instagram pages   We do not want to write typical posts  We do not want to speak the words that all politicians use  We want to get away from this as much as possible  He said Zelenskiy had from the start opposed traditional ways of doing things   As a result  we have one platform only   that s the internet   he said Zelenskiy invites suggestions from Facebook followers on tackling problems such as high utility bills or their choice of prime minister Dmytro Razumkov  Zelenskiy s political adviser  said the comedian would not hold mass rallies before the second vote because the focus was on ensuring he comes across as authentic and transparent  This is a person who is not a weather vane and does not change his position depending on whether it is more comfortable for a voter or less comfortable  You have to run for president  honestly stating your position and what will you do   he said One challenge is attracting voters who are not internet savvy    bridging the gap between online and offline  Oleksandr Korniyenko  another senior member of Zelenskiy s team  said one technique to get around this was emailing voters with campaign messages and encouraging them to print out the email and distribute it  Another was encouraging Zelenskiy s many young supporters to show his social media videos to older voters such as parents  he said Hoping a high turnout will favor Zelenskiy  his team is trying to ensure younger voters cast their ballots in email messages with headlines likely to make them click and read  Our emails are not the typical  You joined such and such a political party   Instead we might have a crazy headline   Fedorov said  In the first round  an email was sent out by Zelenskiy s team with the subject line  You ve been left out   The message itself said  everyone has already voted except you  and urged those who had voted to encourage others to vote  Fedorov said  We are not afraid to be creative   he said  NOT A JOKE Zelenskiy has 3 3 million followers on Instagram  more than French President Emmanuel Macron  German Chancellor Angela Merkel  British Prime Minister Theresa May and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte combined  Poroshenko has 234 000 The comedian s posts offer snapshots of his life such as working out in the gym or going for a run  and allow him to poke fun at his rivals  expense  When former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko  who was eliminated in the first round of voting  posted a video of herself eating a hot dog at a popular gas station chain to show her common touch  Zelenskiy posted a picture of himself and his team eating a hotdog at the same chain  In order to not be considered as just a joke  we decided to be serious like everyone else   he wrote underneath  Zelenskiy is likely to come under more scrutiny over policy before the runoff  including in the debate  He is wealthy and the image of the fictional president he plays  humble and scrupulously honest  is likely to be challenged by Poroshenko  Zelenskiy has been accused during the campaign of being the puppet of a rich businessman whose TV channel airs his shows  Zelenskiy and the oligarch deny this  and both say their relationship is purely professional Razumkov says the campaign has shown Zelenskiy is his own man  In the Zelenskiy campaign  everything is completely different  When he launched his campaign  he said   I want to show how you can become president  but remain a human being      Editing by Timothy Heritage  

MADRID   The demographic shift in Britain three years after its decision to leave the European Union could tip the scales in favor of remaining should a second referendum be held  Spain s Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said on Wednesday  Britain voted by a narrow margin in June 2016 to leave the EU but parliament has been unable to agree on how this will be managed  prompting calls for a second referendum  Spain is particularly affected as nearly 300 000 British people live in Spain  many of whom are pensioners living in coastal regions  while the Spanish economy depends heavily on tourism with Britons being the most numerous foreign visitors  Borrell said another referendum did not guarantee a different outcome  But a rise in the number of eligible young voters  who tended to vote remain  and a fall in the number of older voters  more likely to choose Brexit  could tip the balance  he said  It s true that  with young people in favor of remaining and older people leaving  just through the passing of these three years  with the demographic dynamics as they are  I m sure the result would be different   Borrell told Telecinco TV  European Union leaders are expected to grant Prime Minister Theresa May a second delay to Brexit at an emergency meeting on Wednesday ahead of the latest deadline of Friday  with EU diplomats saying a year long extension was likely   Reporting by Paul Day  Editing by Angus MacSwan  

  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in position to win a fourth consecutive term on Wednesday  with nearly all of the votes counted  By Wednesday evening  the rival Blue and White alliance led by Benny Gantz had conceded the race  though ballots were still being counted   After the final tally  it will be up to President Reuven Rivlin to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance

cameras at polls and boasts of low turnoutA public relations firm has claimed credit for placing cameras in Arab polling stations in support of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  boasting that the effort helped lower voter turnout  according to posts on the company s Facebook page The company  Kaizler Inbar  in a public Facebook post wrote   Thanks to us placing observers in every polling station we managed to lower the voter turnout to under 50 percent  the lowest in recent years   according to a translation in the Israeli news outlet Haaretz The company said it worked with Likud to distribute the cameras  The company is headed by Sagi Kaizler  a former leader of a West Bank settler group  who confirmed to Haaretz that his company was behind the Likud funded effort A photo of staff members

stations in predominantly Arab towns  Some of the cameras were concealed  as seen in videos online  Likud said the cameras were deployed to record evidence of potential voter fraud The Arab party

coalition CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesParties on the right line up behind NetanyahuFour right wing and religious parties had publicly pledged by Wednesday morning to support Mr  Netanyahu in his bid to form Israel s next governing coalition  Those commitments  if they hold  leave him just one seat short of a parliamentary majority and a fourth consecutive term in office The four parties   Kulanu  the Union of Right Wing Parties  and the ultra Orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism   are projected to win a combined 25 seats  Together with the 35 seats that Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party is projected to win  such a coalition would have 60 seats in the 120 seat Parliament Also among what Mr  Netanyahu terms his  natural partners  is the hard line Yisrael Beiteinu party  led by Avigdor Lieberman  which is projected to take five seats The party has joined coalition governments led by Mr  Netanyahu in the past  but Mr  Lieberman was holding out on Wednesday  saying he was waiting for the final tally of votes  including the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients that are to be counted later this week Mr  Lieberman served as foreign affairs minister and then defense minister under Mr  Netanyahu  but resigned from the government in November  complaining of a soft policy toward Hamas  the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza A

next steps depend on Israel s president  a Netanyahu foePresident Reuven Rivlin will decide whether to invite Mr  Netanyahu to form a governing coalition  though the two men have made little secret over the years of their mutual loathing  The president s office said Wednesday that he would begin consulting party heads next week to gauge their choices for prime minister In what the office described as a  historic and pioneering decision   it plans to broadcast those meetings live  in the name of transparency   That move may offer Mr  Rivlin protection from possible barbs from Mr  Netanyahu if the process does not go as the prime minister would like  Here is a guide to The New York Times s coverage of the Israeli election  The origins of the animosity between the president and prime minister are unclear  but it burst into the open when Mr  Rivlin  a veteran of Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party and a former speaker of Parliament  was running for the presidency in 2014 So determined was Mr  Netanyahu to thwart Mr  Rivlin s candidacy that he tried to recruit Elie Wiesel  a Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate  for the job   even though Mr  Wiesel  who has since died  was not an Israeli citizen at the time  When that failed  Mr  Netanyahu floated the idea of abolishing the largely ceremonial office Mr  Rivlin  79  has spoken out forcefully against the government s attempts to curb the independence of the courts and the media  and what he called a lack of  statesmanship  under Mr  Netanyahu    ISABEL KERSHNERImageThe settlement of Beitar Illit  Making an appeal

where I will continue to fight for them  In November  Mr  Bennett sought to be named defense minister  but the prime minister turned him down The New Right broke away from a more established right wing party  aiming to free itself of the influence of ultra Orthodox rabbis and more extremist elements in the pro settler community  But it defined itself by what it was not  rather than what it was  and its election ads were widely seen as sophomoric  They were rising stars with a solid base of support  which they abandoned   said Tal Shalev  a political reporter for Walla  a news site Mr  Bennett and Ms  Shaked had expected to compete with Mr  Gantz for support from the center right  Instead  those voters appeared to turn to other parties on the right  believing Mr  Netanyahu s dire warnings that a Gantz victory would mean a return to left wing government Ms  Shaked  the justice minister  is highly popular among Likud activists  many of whom see her as a future prime minister

OTTAWA   Canada is expecting foreign interference in its national election in October  and is considering stronger regulation of social media companies to ensure they block meddling in the voting  the minister responsible for election integrity said on Monday The minister spoke after the release of an updated report by Canada s electronic eavesdropping and security agency on online interference by other countries in the Canadian election  We judge it very likely that Canadian voters will encounter some form of foreign cyber interference related to the 2019 federal election   the report said   However  at this time  it is improbable that this foreign cyber interference will be of the scale of Russian activity against the 2016 United States presidential election   Canada is a target of choice for those who seek to undermine our democracy   said the minister  Karina Gould  at a news conference in Ottawa The report does not indicate what countries are likely to attack Canada  and both Harjit Sajjan  the defense minister  and Shelly Bruce  who heads the electronic security agency  declined to elaborate Ms  Gould also criticized Google  Twitter and Facebook for not providing the Canadian government with the same degree of information they have offered Europe about their efforts to mitigate possible election interference  We have not really seen that much progress with them   she said  adding that the major social media platforms have declined to give the government regular updates about what they are observing and what they are doing to prevent any misbehavior  There s a lot left to be desired in terms of how seriously they re taking these issues   she said Kevin Chan  the head of public policy for Facebook Canada  said the company plans to introduce new rules for paid political advertising in Canada and is making efforts to block foreign meddling in elections  We take the protection of election integrity on our platform extremely seriously at Facebook  and we want to be a force for good in Canadian democracy   he said in a statement ImageKarina Gould was sworn in as the Canadian minister responsible for election integrity in 2017 CreditSean Kilpatrick The Canadian Press  via Associated PressColin McKay  head of government policy at Google Canada  said the company had met several times with several branches of the Canadian government to discuss  transparency  cybersecurity and information  The company is also working with Canada s Canadian Center for Cyber Security  a government agency  on preventing malicious attacks  Twitter declined to comment  We have every intention of continuing our close work with government to protect Canada s democratic institutions and election activities   Mr  McKay said in a statement The company did not address Ms  Gould s call for formal regulation Ms  Gould said Canada was reviewing its laws to see how they can be used to force action by online companies  and also considering new legislation It is also reviewing steps by other countries  including Britain s proposal on Monday to set up a social media regulator  and recent changes to Australia s laws that  among other things  could lead to the jailing of  executives from social media companies if they do not  expeditiously  remove content with graphic violence on their platforms  We are having active conversations with our partners and allies around the world as to what this would look like in the Canadian context   Ms  Gould said She added   The platforms have been able to avoid being held to account for what takes place on their platforms for too long  Separately on Monday  Facebook banned several Canadians and groups that promote white supremacy In a statement  the company said it was shutting down accounts held by Faith Goldy  a far right former mayoral candidate in Toronto  and several groups including the Soldiers of Odin and the Canadian Nationalist Front The report was issued by the Communications Security Establishment  which is a branch of the military and headed by Ms  Bruce  It issued a similar report in 2017 Earlier this year  the government set up a committee with representatives from the civil service  the security service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to look for signs of interference in this year s vote The report found that any interference is likely to be limited to the spread of misinformation during the campaign  It concluded that any interference in voting results was highly unlikely because Canada still uses paper ballots in national votes  

ISTANBUL ANKARA   It was midnight on election night when Turkey s main opposition party finally believed it had overturned a decade and a half of failure at the polls and delivered a stinging defeat to the country s master campaigner  President Tayyip Erdogan The candidate of the secularist Republican People s Party  CHP  for mayor of Ankara was comfortably ahead in the capital  but in Istanbul   the biggest prize in Sunday s local elections   Erdogan s ruling AK Party candidate had declared victory CHP politicians and supporters  who had endured more than a dozen election and referendum losses at the hands of Erdogan s Islamist rooted AKP since 2002  were well accustomed to crushing disappointment once the ballots were counted This time was different  At around 12 a m  we realized that we were clearly the winners of the election  that we had won   said Suleyman Celebi  an aide to CHP Istanbul candidate Ekrem Imamoglu The party s own data  he said  showed they had defeated Erdogan s close ally and former prime minister Binali Yildirim  despite an exhaustive and bitter two month campaign waged by the president and backed by an overwhelmingly pro government media Once they saw the numbers  Imamoglu and his team refused to back down   We believed after that that there was no turning back  and that we would win   Celebi told Reuters That newfound confidence  supported by initial results the next morning showing Imamoglu had narrowly beaten Yildirim  was forged in an opposition campaign that contrasted sharply with Erdogan s high profile  confrontational election strategy The softly spoken Imamoglu  spurning the kind of mass rallies which Erdogan addressed daily  sought to win over a broad spectrum of voters with a positive message  meeting many of them face to face in a campaign which even his opponents acknowledged struck a chord with the electorate Celebi said Turks  tiring of  divisive and polarizing language  from their leaders  warmed to a new style of politics   This time we saw an open will to vote for Ekrem Imamoglu across all parts of society   he said The CHP made a formal alliance with the breakaway nationalist Iyi  Good  Party and also won votes in Istanbul from supporters of the pro Kurdish HDP party  which chose not to field a mayoral candidate there to boost Imamoglu s chances  DENTED AURAConfirmation of defeat in Istanbul   a city of 15 million people   and Ankara would not reduce Erdogan s sweeping presidential powers  but would seriously dent the aura of invincibility he has built up during 16 years of ever tighter control over the country  His AKP  which has challenged results in both Ankara and Istanbul  still won 51 6 percent of the national vote together with its nationalist MHP alliance partner  down from 53 7 percent in parliamentary elections last year Three party sources who spoke to Reuters all said there were flaws in a campaign which struck a relentlessly belligerent tone  linking Erdogan s opponents to terrorists and painting the vote bleakly as a  matter of survival  for Turkey  Maybe we should have given another message instead of  survival    said one source at AKP headquarters in Ankara who described it as ill suited for voters worried about living standards and local services  As early as January  AKP officials were sounding the alarm over falling public support amid high inflation and rising unemployment Authorities responded to soaring food prices by setting up stalls in Ankara and Istanbul selling subsidized vegetables That too may have backfired  the same source said  as TV footage of people queueing for food revived images of  old Turkey  and the chronic inflation of the 1990s   Long lines being formed disrupted the perception of the AK Party   he said Another party source said the AKP was still missing former campaign manager Erol Olcok  a close friend of Erdogan who masterminded AKP election victories before he was killed on an Istanbul bridge during a failed military coup in 2016 In recent elections  the AKP could not  find its groove   he said Praising the CHP s strategy of focusing on  direct contact with the people   a third source said   If we had paid attention to the messages from the start and then taken necessary steps  the results could have been different today  For Imamoglu  now preparing to take over Turkey s largest city and govern 15 million people with a projected expenditure of 24 billion lira   4 3 billion   the campaign is over but the battle not yet won The AKP has appealed results of all 39 districts in Istanbul  A party official said on Thursday that once the recount was complete  the AKP s candidate would emerge on top Imamoglu says the electoral board  must do its job  and declare him victor but  in keeping with the tone of his campaign  he has stressed consensus over confrontation  We really need to help each other   he said a day after the vote  as it became clear the close result could trigger a bitter dispute   I would like to remind you that we walk side by side on the same path  that we are in the same boat    1   5 5907 liras   Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay

MILWAUKEE   With their recent selection of Milwaukee for their party s 2020 convention  Democrats left little doubt that they believe their path to the White House runs through the Midwest in general and Wisconsin in particular Their optimism spiked in November  when Democrats defeated Scott Walker  the state s two term conservative governor  And they were energized and optimistic again this week for an intensely politicized State Supreme Court election they hoped would show Wisconsin trending steadily blue Then reality hit  A conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory on Tuesday  underscoring instead how competitive Wisconsin politics remain For Democrats  an intense effort to rebuild their Midwestern  blue wall  for 2020 is showing gains in Michigan and Pennsylvania  both of which President Trump captured in 2016  On Tuesday  Democrats flipped a key Pennsylvania State Senate seat that Republicans had long held outside Pittsburgh  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  But in Wisconsin  the apparent loss of the State Supreme Court race   Judge Hagedorn leads by nearly 6 000 votes and a recount is possible   underscored what strategists in both parties said in interviews this week  The state is a tossup in 2020 and its political identity is very much in flux  Republicans know they need this state and are going to fight like hell to keep it in President Trump s column   said Joe Zepecki  a Democratic strategist in Wisconsin  He said that Mr  Walker s loss in November may have fired up the conservative base just as Hillary Clinton s 2016 loss did for Democrats last November  They re coming with everything they ve got   he said of Republicans   That means we have work to do  Wisconsin s reputation as a battleground state is well earned  In the three closest presidential elections of recent times   2000  2004 and 2016   Wisconsin was decided by the narrowest average margin of any other state  less than one percentage point in each election Mr  Walker lost his re election bid for governor by less than one percentage point  after warning all year of a coming blue wave  Over the weekend  Mr  Walker offered a pep talk to Republican activists in Milwaukee about the stakes in electing Judge Hagedorn  a former lead counsel to his administration  who defended contentious election issues such as a voter ID law  Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field  Democrats wanted to defeat Judge Hagedorn and gain a liberal Supreme Court majority  Mr  Walker warned  so they could seize control of redistricting after 2020 and  get rid of one  maybe two seats that we currently have in the House of Representatives  Democrats  haven t forgotten about how close the election was  in 2016  Mr  Walker told party activists gathered for breakfast at the American Serb Hall in Milwaukee   They re not going to make that mistake again  ImageA conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory for the State Supreme Court on Tuesday  underscoring how competitive Wisconsin politics remain CreditRick Wood Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  via Associated PressMark Jefferson  executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party  said Judge Hagedorn s apparent victory showed the power of the party s engaged conservative base  The grass roots took offense to the attacks on Hagedorn s Christian faith   he said  referring to news accounts that the judge founded a Christian school that allows firing teachers in same sex relationships But others say Mr  Walker s midterm loss is probably a more relevant bellwether for 2020 than the Supreme Court race  because turnout was more than twice as high  and Mr  Walker is a polarizing  partisan figure in Wisconsin  much like the president Barry White  a lawyer who voted for Mr  Walker in 2010 but snubbed him in 2018 in favor of his Democratic opponent  Tony Evers  said he had wanted to make a bigger point  His ballot was  a repudiation of Trump and Republicans that insist on carrying his water   Mr  White said   It was the only message I could send  Mr  White lives in the Milwaukee suburbs  the state s most populous Republican region  Mr  Evers s gains there last year were a key to his narrow victory  In an interview  Mr  Walker said that should be a lesson to Mr  Trump   To win  he s going to have to improve his numbers in the suburbs   he said   With the passion the opposition is going to have  he s going to have to make some inroads  Last fall  Mr  Walker matched his vote totals from 2014 in the three suburban counties outside Milwaukee  But a surge of Democratic votes in the demographically changing suburbs meant his vote share dropped in 2018 by 12 percentage points in Waukesha County and by 16 points in Ozaukee County  It s the paradox of Trump s strategy of appealing to his base constantly   said Charles Franklin  director of the Marquette Law School Poll of the state   It also helps gin up the feelings of your opposition  I think that it s a gift to Democrats that keeps on giving  One of those voters is Tiffany Duncan  a 26 year old employee of a printing company  who skipped the 2016 election because she didn t like either major party candidate  But she definitely plans to vote in 2020   for whichever Democrat takes on Mr  Trump   I didn t think Trump was this crazy   she said as she walked to Caf Bavaria in Wauwatosa Village Still  Mr  Franklin said  the state is so evenly divided  its chances of determining an Electoral College majority for either party  puts us at ground zero  In a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than Mr  Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president  meaning his path to a second victory in the state is both uphill and narrow Many of today s uncertain voters   who are Republicans or Republican leaning independents   may come home to the party  especially once there is a Democratic nominee to contrast with the president John Carlson  a 59 year old engineer in Milwaukee  is one of those gettable voters for both parties  He went for Mr  Trump in 2016 but is uncertain if he will do so again  Democrats could win him over  he said    if the Democrats came up with somebody reasonable  which I m not expecting them to do  Republicans are framing the Milwaukee convention as an opportunity to motivate their own base  expecting Democrats to showcase a parade of far left figures and policies  National Republicans have already begun a coordinated effort to paint Democrats as wild eyed radicals steering the country toward socialism ImageIn a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than President Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times Democrats were energized in 2018  like any party is out of power during the first midterm  but then decided to go off the rails once they seized control of the House   said Rick Wiley  a former political director of the Republican National Committee  whose roots are in Wisconsin  The president energizes base Republicans and has had great success with working class voters   he said in an email   Those same working class voters won t check the box on a progressive socialist nominee  Mr  Jefferson of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he was upbeat about Mr  Trump despite public polling  I expect to see the same thing this cycle as 2016  where all polling suggests it s an uphill battle and on Election Day things look a lot different   he said   I think the Democrats are once again overplaying their hand and a little too confident  When Mr  Trump holds rallies aimed at Wisconsinites  he visits media markets across northern and western regions  largely agricultural and rural  where in 2016 he outperformed earlier Republican nominees In the Supreme Court race  Judge Hagedorn  the conservative  got a major boost in the Green Bay and Wausau markets  enough to overcome a deep deficit in Dane County  which includes Madison  the state s bluest stronghold In the 18 counties in the Green Bay media market  where TV ads linked Judge Hagedorn to Mr  Trump  voters swung by 18 points toward the conservative compared with a State Supreme Court election last year won by a liberal judge  according to an analysis by Craig Gilbert of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel The Saturday before Election Day  there was no shortage of avid Trump supporters at Roar Off the Shore  a tasting of craft beers and cheeses east of Green Bay in Kewaunee County  which is on the thumb of the Wisconsin mitten Though the county s populace is small  Mr  Trump s ability to run up the score in such places was repeated all across rural America in 2016  He won Kewaunee County  a dairy region  by 28 points compared with Mitt Romney s six point margin as the 2012 Republican nominee  I m tired of politicians  he s not a politician   said Randy Boor  57  who works in a factory that makes commercial cookware  He judged Mr  Trump s chances of carrying the state in 2020 as even better than in 2016  We ve got a guy there that s delivering   he said   He wants to do the frickin  job  You know how much could get done if he wasn t being opposed by all these idiots  Another beer taster  Dave Soborowicz  a 47 year old plumber  had driven across the state from Eau Claire to attend the event with his brother  who wore a Trump hat  But Mr  Soborowicz was less enamored of the president and unsure if he would vote for him the next time   He s so bloated in his head that he thinks he s still going to get his frickin  wall  when he

WASHINGTON   Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it s time to kick off bipartisan talks on a new budget pact to fund federal agencies over the next two years The Kentucky Republican told reporters that he spoke with President Donald Trump last week and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday morning  and that both support trying to reach an agreement on a new spending pact for both the Pentagon and domestic programs  We ve agreed to put together  at the staff level  a group to begin discussing the possibility of reaching a two year  spending  caps deal so we can move ahead hopefully with some kind of regular appropriations process   McConnell told reporters A new funding agreement is needed to prevent the return of spending cuts under the remnants of a failed 2011 budget and debt agreement  Trump has only reluctantly signed spending bills during his two years in office  and his acting chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  is a budget hawk who s signaling that the White House is taking a harder line this time around Trump s budget  submitted last month  would give a sharp increase to the Pentagon but would cut back domestic programs  a nonstarter for Democrats controlling the House  Any bipartisan agreement would renounce Trump s budget  which drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans when it was unveiled last month The administration gave a chilly reaction to the developments  Democrats aren t even writing a budget and are pushing for a reckless  caps deal  that would cost taxpayers over  2 trillion and explode deficits   said a senior administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions have been private   We ve made clear to Congress that type of a wasteful spending is unacceptable  Meanwhile  a revolt by liberal Democrats against a separate budget measure backed by Pelosi  D Calif   and other House party leaders led the leadership to cancel a vote on it that had been tentatively scheduled for Wednesday  That proposal would have increased spending for both the Pentagon and domestic agencies  The increases would ease the way for this year s round of annual congressional spending bills this spring Progressives said the leadership backed plan didn t contain enough money for liberal priorities  They re pushing for significantly higher spending for domestic programs  saying the Pentagon budget is bloated while domestic programs are being shortchanged  For me the big issue is freezing defense spending   said Rep  Ro Khanna  D Calif   I don t think this is an issue of divided government  This is an issue of a divided Democratic caucus on issues of defense spending  Let s go on the record and vote on whether we should be increasing defense spending or not  The guns vs  butter debate has split the Democratic caucus  pitting progressives from solidly Democratic districts against more moderate Democrats from more marginal political turf  The moderates say liberals  demands are politically unrealistic and would add too much to the deficit Even as the leadership proposal foundered  the House on Tuesday quietly adopted a resolution that would permit the chamber to begin voting on the annual spending measures  though it didn t pick winners and losers between the defense and nondefense sides of the federal ledger

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump may feel he is  stuck  with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell  whom he has blasted for engineering four interest rate hikes since Trump appointed him  but none of Trump s other Fed appointees has stood in the way of the tightening campaign and at least one has said even higher rates may be necessary The voting records and public statements of Trump s Fed appointees  who now form a solid majority of the Fed s Washington based board of governors  show not only consensus around the recent increases  but no support so far for the rate cuts Trump has demanded  A possible upcoming nominee to the Fed  economic commentator Stephen Moore  has said he agrees with Trump that rates should be cut and had earlier called for Powell s ouster  Trump has mulled whether he could fire Powell  but in a March 8 phone call  reported by the Wall Street Journal  acknowledged he was  stuck  with the Fed chair for Powell s full four year term that runs to February 2022  If Moore does take a seat alongside Trump s appointees at the Fed  at this point he would be the outlier  I am comfortable with the current stance of our policy   Trump s newest appointee  Fed Governor Michelle Bowman  said in February in her only comments about monetary policy to date  Bowman joined the Fed in November  when the administration was growing agitated about rising volatility in financial markets  She voted for the December rate increase that has become a particular target of Trump s ire and point of blame for  in his view  holding back the economy  The White House on Tuesday announced Bowman would be renominated for a full 14 year term to follow the end next January of the short  partial term she was appointed to fill Trump s hand picked vice chair  Richard Clarida  voted for the December increase and the one before it in September  which was approved shortly after he joined the Fed board Randal Quarles  who was the first appointment Trump made to the Fed as his presidency took shape in 2017  voted for five rates hikes from December of that year to December 2018  and his most recent comments show the wide and sometimes paradoxical gap between the president s view of what the Fed should be doing  and those of the people he has chosen to oversee the central bank In what amounted to a bullish defense of where the economy is heading  Quarles last week said in fact that rates may need to move higher precisely because Trump s tax cuts and policies may produce a  persistent  boost to productivity and growth   Further increases in the policy rate may be necessary at some point  a stance I believe is consistent with my optimistic view of the economy s growth potential and momentum   Quarles said in remarks at the Manhattan Institute last week For now the Fed intends to hold rates steady  a position it reached both as Trump publicly called for a halt to rate increases  but also   and what Fed officials say mattered to them   as economic and financial data globally indicated a broad slowdown from the faster than expected growth of 2018 Trump blames the weaker data on what he called in a tweet on Thursday the Fed s  destructive  rate hikes  Others see a number of causes  including Trump s trade policies  and feel growth is likely to continue though at a tepid pace  We had this synchronized acceleration of growth a couple of years ago  Now it is synchronized deceleration and a slowing momentum across the spectrum   International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in Washington on Tuesday   Nobody wins a trade war   RULE BY CONSENSUSUnanimity among Fed board members is largely the norm  The Fed strives to be a consensus driven organization  led  but not dictated to  by a chair whose job is to canvas and shape opinion among as many as 18 other policymakers split between the seven member board based in Washington and 12 regional bank heads The regional bankers  five of whom each year have a formal vote on interest rates even as all 12 participate in Fed debates  are part of a now century old system meant precisely to guard against too much power residing with the board and the chair in Washington There are currently two open board seats Even as Fed officials have begun to speak more frequently and openly in public  formal dissents against any given policy action have in general declined since the 1970s  The last one by a board member was in 2005 by then Governor Mark Olson against a rate increase But that doesn t necessarily mean conformity inside the room when the Federal Open Market Committee meets every six weeks  Opposition to some of the extraordinary policies put in place to fight the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis  for example  led former Governor Kevin Warsh to resign even though he never dissented  maintaining a unified face for the Fed during a treacherous time Yet with the current group of appointees there is little sense of the sort of behind the scenes warfare that occurred  for example  when a group of governors tried to revolt against the recession inducing steps pushed by 1980s era Fed Chairman Paul Volcker to curb runaway inflation Transcripts of recent Fed meetings won t be released for five years  but the summary minutes of sessions last fall show the central bank sifting through data  coming to grips with developing risks  and shifting their stance as a result By January   all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to maintain  the existing interest rate  the minutes stated  Several  said continued growth might warrant higher rates eventually There was no mention of support for a rate cut   Reporting by Howard Schneider  Editing by Dan Burns and Andrea Ricci  

HONG KONG   A political party led by the president of the Maldives appeared to have won decisively in parliamentary elections over the weekend  a result that may help him restore political freedoms in a strategically important country with an authoritarian past The president  Ibrahim Mohamed Solih  had won a resounding victory in presidential elections last September  But parts of his party s agenda have been stymied because some of its allies in a governing coalition are aligned with a former strongman leader  Abdulla Yameen  who has been widely accused of corruption and repression The Maldives  a chain of islands southwest of India  has traditionally fallen within New Delhi s sphere of influence  Yet it also stretches across maritime routes that are crucial to China  and Beijing has recently spent hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure projects in the Maldives Critics have warned of the Maldives falling prey to  debt trap diplomacy   meaning that it could be pressured to offer security concessions to China as repayment for large loans  Some politicians  as well as Western and Indian diplomats  have warned that a growing dependence on China could be a threat to the country s sovereignty Some political analysts saw the victory last year for Mr  Solih  who has been skeptical of China s influence  as good news for India s interests  On Sunday  a news article in The Economic Times  an Indian newspaper  described the parliamentary rout by Mr  Solih s Maldivian Democratic Party as a  shot in arm  for New Delhi in its  neighborhood  Still  Constantino Xavier  a foreign policy fellow at Brookings India in New Delhi  said the  lure of cheap and easy money  made it likely that the Maldives s relationship with China would deepen   despite everything that leaders will say in public   In the long term  the natural tendency of any leader in the Maldives will be to increase ties with China   he said   China has that financial power to deliver quickly and effectively  Preliminary results from the vote on Saturday showed that the Maldivian Democratic Party was on track to win more than two thirds of the 87 seats in the country s parliament  the local news media reported on Sunday  It needs just 44 seats to become the first party to secure a parliamentary majority since the Maldives held its first free election in 2008 Other parties won fewer than seven seats each on Saturday  according to The Maldives Independent  a local news site Past elections in the Maldives have been marred by accusations of widespread irregularities  Mr  Yameen was accused of rigging the presidential election last year by forcing employees of state owned companies to vote for his party  stacking the election commission with loyalists  locking up opposition leaders and canceling voter registrations But Transparency Maldives  an election watchdog  said in a statement on Sunday that the previous day s vote had been  transparent and generally well administered  Mr  Solih said in a statement over the weekend that the country s people were the election s  biggest winners   That our campaign was issue oriented and not based on hatred and narrow divisions is a win for our young democracy   he said   That our government did not hinder those candidates with whom we did not agree is a big win for the country  The Maldives made international headlines last winter when Mr  Yameen  the president at the time  set off a political crisis by declaring a state of emergency and sending troops to surround the Supreme Court  The move came the week after the court overturned criminal convictions against nine of Mr  Yameen s opponents One of them was a former president  Mohamed Nasheed  a member of the Maldivian Democratic Party who was then living in exile in London  Mr  Nasheed  who returned to the Maldives in late 2018  was ineligible to run in the September election because he had been sentenced to prison under the Yameen government Mr  Solih ran for president in Mr  Nasheed s place On the campaign trail last year  Mr  Solih pledged to restore democratic freedoms if he won  including rolling back an anti defamation law that Mr  Yameen had introduced as a tool for locking up opponents The anti defamation act was repealed two months later  But Mr  Solih s party has struggled in recent months to carry out other parts of its agenda For example  even though Mr  Solih has promised to investigate the 2014 disappearance of Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla  a prominent journalist critical of Mr  Yameen  a party in the Maldivian Democratic Party s governing coalition refused in February to call a vote on a bill about recovering stolen assets and investigating unresolved murders Mr  Yameen  the former strongman president  was recently imprisoned over a graft scandal involving the country s tourism board  He denies the accusations and was released on bail in late March  days before the parliamentary elections  

SAN SALVADOR   El Salvador s incoming president Nayib Bukele said on Tuesday he would not be inviting the leaders of Honduras  Nicaragua and Venezuela to his June 1 inauguration after criticizing them as illegitimate rulers In a Twitter post  the 37 year old Bukele confirmed news reports that invitations were not being extended to Juan Orlando Hernandez  president of neighboring Honduras  Daniel Ortega  president of Nicaragua  or Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro Bukele  who won an election in February  did not say why the presidents would not be asked  but he has previously criticized all three as men who did not deserve to be in power due to controversies that have clouded their administrations The 2017 re election of Hernandez  a conservative ally of the United States  has been questioned by many  including Bukele  due to a disputed vote count that took weeks to resolve Hernandez appeared to be on track to suffer a shock loss in the election before the official vote count came to a sudden halt  When it restarted more than a day later  the count turned in his favor and he was ultimately declared the winner Ortega  a former Marxist guerrilla and Cold War antagonist of Washington  has faced international condemnation for Nicaragua s a heavy handed crackdown on months of protests that he has described as part of a plot to oust him Maduro  who has presided over an economic and political crisis in Venezuela  has been under pressure to step down amid accusations he has abused his power to suppress the opposition Bukele is one of a host of political figures that have given their support to Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido  who in January declared himself the rightful president Venezuela has rejected criticism of the Maduro government as hostile propaganda and as attempts to set the stage for an intervention by foreign powers in the country   Reporting by Nelson Renteria  Editing by Dave Graham  Editing by Simon Cameron Moore  

Senate Republicans this week adopted rule changes that could make the august upper chamber something like a miniature version of the raucous and deeply partisan House In a bid to speed confirmation of President Trump s nominees  Republicans voted Wednesday to cut the debate time for lower level judicial and administration picks from 30 hours to two  Ordinarily  such a rule change requires the backing of a two thirds supermajority  But the Republican leader  Mitch McConnell  detonated the so called nuclear option  lowering the threshold for passage to a simple majority   a move Mr  Trump had been clamoring for  Only two Republicans joined with Democrats to oppose this latest erosion of the minority party s ability to  advise and consent  This may sound like parliamentary arcana  but the impact should be clear to anyone unnerved by the Senate s newish practice of ramming through Supreme Court picks with a bare majority   another Trump era innovation by Mr  McConnell The Democratic leader  Chuck Schumer  charged that the move  risks turning this body into a colosseum of zero sum infighting  a place where the brute power of the majority rules  with little or no regard to the concerns of the minority party  and where  longstanding rules have little or no meaning  Mr  McConnell contends that he was forced into this by Democrats   mindless  undiscriminating obstruction for the sake of obstruction   This claim will strike many as ludicrous  Well before the name Merrick Garland became synonymous with partisan stonewalling  Mr  McConnell was widely regarded as a master of obstruction  even by members of his own party Even so  it was not the Republican leader who started the Senate down this path  That distinction goes to the former Democratic leader Harry Reid  who  in November 2013  went nuclear to dismantle the filibuster for most judicial and executive nominees  Irked by the Republican minority s bottling up of President Barack Obama s picks  Democrats overwhelmingly backed the measure  which passed by a four vote margin At the time  Mr  Reid blamed Republican obstructionism   They have done everything they can to deny the fact that Obama has been elected and then re elected   he said Like today s Democrats  Republicans then warned of enduring damage to the institution   Breaking the rules to change the rules is un American   said Mr  McConnell  then the minority leader   I just hope the majority leader thinks about his legacy  the future of his party  and  most importantly  the future of our country before he acts  Republicans also vowed that Mr  Reid s team would live to regret crossing this line   Democrats won t be in power in perpetuity   Senator Richard Shelby told reporters   This is a mistake   a big one for the long run  Not six years later  here we are  For all his complaints about Democratic obstructionism  Mr  McConnell has pushed through a record number of Mr  Trump s judicial picks  In addition to killing the filibuster of Supreme Court nominees  Mr  McConnell ended the  blue slip  practice  a tradition that effectively gave senators veto power over nominees from their home state  Now he has done away with extended debate on most nominees Someone needs to stop the spiral  There is much about Senate processes that should be reformed  But razing the body s deliberative culture for partisan gain serves no one well  whichever side does it  Each line crossed makes the next one that much less daunting  This latest power grab has prompted concern about when the Senate will end the legislative filibuster  Such defanging of the minority would likely be a tough sell among lawmakers  But  as with confirmations  the 60 vote requirement on legislation would most likely end in stages  starting with baby steps like requiring only a simple majority to open debate Democratic presidential hopefuls are being asked about the issue  None seem eager to wade in  Yet  But as 2020 approaches  the issue will become more charged  and with every perceived Republican affront  the Democratic base will grow more impatient for its team to play hardball  If Democrats retake the White House and Senate  the pressure to deal with Republican obstructionism will intensify as progressives push bold plans    Medicare for all   the Green New Deal  gun safety measures  and so on   impossible to realize under the current system without a Senate supermajority  But if the rules were changed to allow passage with just 51 votes  who knows what could be achieved  This would make moving legislation through the often infuriating upper chamber easier  more like in the House  which provides few protections against the tyranny of the majority  No doubt this would strike some as a great victory   until the next time their team lost power More on the Senate  nuclear option Senate Republicans Go  Nuclear  to Speed Up Trump ConfirmationsApril 3  2019G O P  Ready to  Nuke  Senate Democrats Again Over Nominee

AUSTIN  Tex    After decades of lawsuits and mass protests failed to radically reform the troubled Police Department  we tried a new tactic a few years ago  Targeting one of the most problematic police union contracts in the country  As a result  Austin went from having a retrograde contract to one that offers transparency and accountability  Others cities can follow this route as well  For years  the Austin Police Department s contract limited civilian oversight  allowed police misconduct records to basically vanish and kept certain important internal affairs files under seal  This lack of oversight  accountability and transparency was linked to the over policing of Austin s black community In Austin  black people represent only 8 percent of the population yet are subjected to 14 percent of stops  26 percent of searches  24 percent of arrests and 31 percent of officer involved shootings  For us  the tipping point came in 2016  after a police officer killed David Joseph  an unarmed  naked black teenager  Around then  a video circulated showing Breaion King  a slim  young black schoolteacher  being violently and needlessly arrested at a traffic stop  When she tried to file a complaint about a year later  a statute of limitations on misconduct negotiated in the police contract prevented the police officers from being disciplined  Mr  Joseph s death was a severe blow to the black community  as were the injustices Ms  King suffered  So we decided that the police contract was the best path forward for reforms  We knew it was going to be a fierce fight  This labor agreement essentially prevented people from being able to make complaints against police officers and was notoriously hard to influence from the outside   For 18 months  our group  the Austin Justice Coalition  led a major grass roots organizing campaign  We demanded a seat at the bargaining table with the City Council and the police union and pressed for reforms with teeth  And we won  In 2017  the City Council voted down the police union contract because of concerns over accountability  not for the usual reasons like salary or benefits   reportedly the first time a City Council has ever done this A year later  it approved a contract with real reforms  Short suspensions are no longer automatically downgraded to confidential written reprimands after a few years  Complaints that suggest police officers may have committed crimes now have a longer investigative period  And people can file complaints online  The City Council also passed an ordinance creating an independent oversight office  which for years had been baked into the contract itself and wrongly used as a bargaining chip  As a result  it was ineffective  Now the oversight office is now accessible to the entire community  It can accept anonymous complaints  file them of its own accord and publicize the findings  In addition  it can provide information on verified complaints for major incidents like deadly officer involved shootings  publicize disciplinary decisions on certain minor incidents and audit footage from body and dashboard cameras  We didn t get everything we wanted  But we set out to make Austin safe for ourselves  livable  where our hyper visibility wouldn t endanger us and make us susceptible to the biases and vagaries of unchecked policing  And these reforms are a major step towards that goal  Here s how we did it  We began our campaign during the city s 2016 budget session so that our demands would interrupt the flow of money into the department  We organized our members to participate in a rare public hearing at city hall on the police contract  and almost every week in 2017  our coalition attended meetings between the city and the police association  We packed chairs around the periphery of the room  took detailed notes and then cross referenced every change to the previous contract  Then we d return to the offices of council members and city negotiators to urge them to support our reforms  Negotiators from the city told us that our presence changed the dynamics of the bargaining by compelling real dialogue between the city and the association  In previous years  the union had railroaded the city for exorbitant pay increases and stipends in exchange for negligible improvements in oversight  The police association resisted our reforms and the city s attempt to include them in their bargaining terms  As the vote drew closer  the union claimed that hundreds of officers would retire en masse if the council rejected the contract   a threat local news stations and our daily paper reported as fact  At that point we had secured only one reform and the narrowest and least visible of them all   the ability to make online complaints  In response  our coalition launched a public information campaign that included community forms in each council member s district  On Dec  13  2017  dozens of people from every district and all walks of life appeared at the City Council meeting to oppose the contract because it did not include meaningful reforms to accountability  transparency or oversight  By midnight  an exhausted council voted that the parties return to the negotiation table to incorporate our reforms  The union backed out of the negotiation  And then the sky didn t fall  Only about 33 police officers retired after the contract was voted down  the total number of retirees that year was about the same as the previous two years  Over the next several months  however  the association was under pressure to negotiate a contract since its members lost their stipends when they refused to return to the table in December  In the summer of 2018  the union swapped out its chief negotiator for one who sought our input  seeming to understand that the union was actually going to have to compromise On Nov  15  the City Council voted unanimously for the much improved contract  which priced out at  44 million  half of the association s  82 5 million bid in the 2017 deal Police union contracts are ripe for reform because so often accountability  transparency and oversight are tied up in them  Yes  the process can be long and taxing  as we know  But the rewards are substantial Sukyi McMahon   SukyiMcMahon  is the chairwoman of the board of the Austin Justice Coalition  of which Chas Moore   iGiveYouMoore  is a co founder and the
