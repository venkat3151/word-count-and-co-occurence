TEL AVIV   When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to undermine his strongest election challenger  he pins a label on him that many Israelis see as an insult   Leftist  Israel was founded by the left  which dominated politics in the early years of the state  In 1992 it took 61 of the 120 seats in the Knesset  or parliament  Nearly 30 years on  the left is forecast to take only around 25 seats in an election on Tuesday The left has been reeling after a series of setbacks   the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995  the failure of his 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords to deliver peace with the Palestinians  many rounds of failed negotiations and years of bloodshed that have made both sides bitter and mistrustful  Now  only 12 percent of Jewish Israelis identify themselves as left wing  according to the Israel Democracy Institute  It was around double that a decade and a half ago  Fifty six percent now describe themselves as right wing  up from 40 percent over the same period  and the amount who say they are centrists is little changed at 26 5 percent With Netanyahu in power for the past decade and months away from becoming Israel s longest serving leader if he is re elected  the right is on the ascendant The only candidate with a chance of beating Netanyahu is not a leftist  Benny Gantz  a former general and political novice  belongs to a new party that is running on a centrist platform  Seeking to win over right leaning voters  Gantz  59  has highlighted his military credentials and is a pragmatist  Gantz was head of the Israeli military during the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and the militant Islamist group Hamas in which 2 100 Palestinians were killed  against an Israeli death toll of 67 soldiers and six civilians Gantz embraces that legacy  running a television ad which highlighted the number of Palestinian militants killed on his watch Careful not to alienate centrist voters  Gantz also chooses his words carefully on the issue that more than any other divides Israel s left and right   a  two state solution  for the Israeli Palestinian conflict Gantz nods to the left by saying Israel should pursue peace and end its dominion over the Palestinians but stops short of endorsing Palestinian statehood Most polls show Gantz s centrist Blue and White party leading Netanyahu s right wing Likud in a straight race  But they also show a Netanyahu led alliance of all the right wing parties is more likely to secure a majority  TRAITORS    Netanyahu has cast Gantz as a weak leftist who will endanger Israel s security by giving territorial concessions to the Palestinians  which is anathema to the right This is Netanyahu s standard play book  say his opponents  The word  left  is a tool to delegitimize everyone or anyone who s against Netanyahu   said Labour lawmaker Merav Michaeli    Left  has become like a curse  so it s not surprising that so many people are trying to avoid it        If there is really deep damage our prime minister has done to society  it s making the left wingers traitors   said Labour supporter Liat Arbel   We are as  much a  part of Israel as right wingers      In the build up to the election  Netanyahu struck an alliance with anti Arab and far right politicians  some of whom seek to annex the Israeli occupied West Bank Foremost among Netanyahu s critics for veering further right is the last left winger to beat him in an election  Ehud Barak Like Gantz  Barak is a former military man  Now retired from politics  Barak  77  says the far right has become the driving force in Israeli politics   like the tail wagging the dog   The left  he says  has lost steam  The left used to have a vision for Israel   a modern  Zionist  enlightened society on the cutting edge of the advanced world   said Barak  who was prime minister from July 1999 until March 2001  The right wing has its own vision which is  in a way  dark  ultra nationalist  somewhat racist and messianic  But it s a burning vision   so it motivates them  Historian Gadi Taub  of Hebrew University s School of Public Policy  describes himself as a former leftist He says the left has become elitist  over critical of their own society  and out of touch with mainstream Israelis  who are deeply skeptical about prospects for peace with Palestinians   The Israeli public is pragmatic  It drew its conclusions from the failure of the left s vision and it changed direction   said Taub NO PEACEFor many Israelis  Barak played a big role in the left s decline  In 2000  he and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat failed to agree a peace accord  From that day onwards the Israeli public believed that there was no partner  that  they  don t want peace   said Angela Godfrey Goldstein  a veteran Israeli peace activist   Israelis hunkered down  The outbreak of a Palestinian intifada  or uprising  a few months later drove the sides even further apart  Palestinians carried out shootings and suicide bombings  and Israel carried out air strikes and army raids Opinion was further hardened when Israel pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza in 2005  only for Hamas to seize control of the territory two years later  further dimming prospects for peace  If he is to secure victory  Gantz may have to convince voters he is in the model of former commanders turned politicians  such as Rabin and Ariel Sharon  who was prime minister from March 2001 until April 2006 Gantz was asked about the comparison with Rabin at an election event in Tel Aviv on Tuesday  To be compared to Yitzhak Rabin would be nothing short of the best compliment I can think of   he replied   Rabin was center  a bit left  a bit right  however you want to define him    Writing by Maayan Lubell  Additional

ISTANBUL ANKARA   President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party has submitted objections to local election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara  party officials said on Tuesday  after results showed the opposition earned narrow victories in both cities The AK Party is on track to lose control of what are Turkey s two biggest cities  its commercial hub of Istanbul and the capital Ankara  in a surprise election setback that may complicate Erdogan s plans to combat recession In Istanbul  the mayoral candidate of the main opposition Republican People s Party  CHP   Ekrem Imamoglu  and his AKP rival  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  both said on Monday Imamoglu was around 25 000 votes ahead  Istanbul has an estimated total population of 15 million The AKP had previously said it would use its right to object to the results where there were voting irregularities  adding that the errors at the ballots had affected the outcome On Tuesday  Bayram Senocak  the AKP s Istanbul head said that objections had been submitted by the 3 p m   1200 GMT  deadline for appeals  and added that legal action would be taken against electoral officials who made the errors  We have submitted all our appeals to the district electoral councils   Senocak said  as he waved ballot records in which he said vote count irregularities could be seen An AKP deputy chairman later said the difference between Imamoglu and Yildirim was down to 20 509 votes and would keep falling as a result of their appeals  He said the elections were  the biggest blemish in Turkish democratic history  The CHP s Istanbul head Canan Kaftancioglu said her party submitted objections in 22 districts  adding they expected to receive 4 960 more votes after the appeals were resolved  They are trying to steal the will of the people as it was reflected in the ballots   she told reporters in Istanbul The CHP s Imamoglu said on Tuesday he was saddened by the AKP failure to congratulate him after the election board count put him ahead  I m watching Mr Binali Yildirim with regret  You were a minister of this nation  the parliament speaker and a prime minister   Imamoglu said in Istanbul   What could be more noble than congratulating   The world is watching us with shame right now  We are ready to manage the big city of Istanbul  Let go and congratulate us with honor  so we can do our job   he said  MOMENT OF BEGINNING Ahead of the elections  the CHP had formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival that of the AKP and their nationalist MHP partners  The alliances nominated joint candidates in certain cities  including Ankara and Istanbul Imamoglu  who laid a wreath at the mausoleum of modern Turkey s founder  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk  in Ankara  later went to CHP headquarters to meet Mansur Yavas  the opposition s candidate in the capital  Speaking at the CHP building  Imamoglu said the elections marked a  moment of beginning  for Turkey In Ankara  Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes  ahead of his AKP rival and former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki in Sunday s local elections by nearly 4 percentage points  The AKP said it had also submitted objections to results across Ankara Defeats in Ankara and Istanbul would be a significant setback for Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics for more than 16 years  He had campaigned relentlessly ahead of the vote  describing it as a  matter of survival  for the country Erdogan s political success has rested on years of stellar economic growth in Turkey  but an economic recession that has brought surging inflation and unemployment and a plunging lira currency have taken their toll on his popularity Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to pressure on the lira  which weakened sharply last week as a lack of confidence in the currency among Turks led them to snap up record holdings of dollars and gold On Tuesday the lira weakened more than 2 percent against the dollar on concerns about tensions with the United States after it halted delivery to Turkey of equipment related to the F 35 fighter aircraft   Reporting by Ezgi Erkoyun and by Tuvan Gumrukcu  Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay  Writing by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Daren Butler  Editing by Dominic Evans  Gareth Jones  William Maclean

JERUSALEM   Frustrated over their choices in the Israeli election  and at Arab politicians whom they describe as ineffective  some Palestinian citizens of Israel have been gathering popular support for a boycott of Tuesday s ballot But a well known Palestinian hip hop artist released a powerful new video on Thursday pushing back on the boycott  urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes   and expressing hope that a strong turnout on Tuesday could help send Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu packing  or even  to prison  Tamer Must Vote    <U+062A><U+0627><U+0645><U+0631>

Arabic language video  which spread widely on social media and has sparked a robust online debate  the rapper  Tamer Nafar of Lod  Israel  argues with himself over whether to vote or stay home  then comes down strongly in favor of voting   dramatizing what Mr  Nafar said had been his own internal dialogue over the past few weeks  It s our land  but their state   the voice of the pro boycott Mr  Nafar says in the video  which is titled  Tamer Must Vote  in English  adding of the Israeli Parliament   The Knesset s not for me  ImageIsraeli border police officers standing guard next to posters depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditOded Balilty Associated PressBut the Mr  Nafar who favors voting retorts that even the shekel is Israeli  What then   throw away our money  and drop out of the economy  since the taxes paid by Arab citizens fund the army   Plant tea leaves at home so we won t fund missiles on Gaza   They re using us to look liberal   the pro boycotter says  echoing a frequent argument of Palestinian citizens who say that participating in Israeli democracy provides a veneer of equality in Western eyes  Yeah  baby  democracy is so  80s   the pro voter says sarcastically His vote wouldn t change anything  the pro boycotter responds  It s like stepping  into a missile war when all I got is a knife   or fighting a tank  when all I got is a stone  The pro voter hits back by acknowledging  it doesn t mean that we ll liberate Palestine   but says  dropping the mic  that  if our vote will erase Lieberman  imprison Bibi  then we re ready   referring to the former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman Indeed  one of the richest ironies that could emerge from Tuesday s election would be if strong Arab turnout raised the minimum vote threshold for political parties to gain entry into Parliament so high that Mr  Lieberman failed to clear it  His party  Yisrael Beiteinu  is struggling in the polls  Read about how Prime Minister Netanyahu s anti Arab provocations may backfire this time around  though they may have helped him in the past  It was Mr  Lieberman who pushed a change in the election law that raised the voting percentage threshold in 2015  as a way of banning Arab parties from the Knesset  The Arab parties responded at the time by joining forces  and their Joint List won a record 13 seats in the Knesset that year Some polls this year indicated turnout among Palestinian citizens would be even higher  given widespread anger at Mr  Netanyahu  who has been running an exceptionally anti Arab campaign  But the boycott movement is having the reverse effect  exasperating Arab leaders as well as many Jewish Israeli opponents of Mr  Netanyahu who hoped that Arab voters could play a decisive role in defeating him In an interview  Mr  Nafar said he was still hoping for such a result  which he said would be  poetic justice   Read our guide to the Israeli elections  He said that he was not enamored of Benny Gantz  the former army chief who is neck and neck with Mr  Netanyahu in the polls  but that Mr  Gantz would be preferable to Mr  Netanyahu  And although Mr  Netanyahu is facing indictment only on corruption charges  Mr  Nafar said   he would prefer it be for  war crimes     At least it s something   he added ImageBenny Gantz  leader of the Blue and White party  during an election campaign event in Ashkelon on Wednesday CreditAmir Cohen Reuters I guess I m watching too much  Game of Thrones    he said Mr  Nafar  39  began his hip hop career in the late 1990s  and his lyrics took a strong political turn with the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada  in 2000  The son of Palestinian refugees and a father of two  he was the star of a celebrated autobiographical film   Junction 48   in 2016  The Israeli culture minister  Miri Regev  walked out on his performance at the country s movie awards ceremony that year and has tried to have his performances canceled  I m not saying that being in the Knesset is the best medicine  but if I want to let go of it I should do that dose by dose   he said  explaining his decision to vote   not all at once  with nothing in its place In the video  Mr  Nafar s pro boycott persona has little use for Arab politicians   Did they deal with poverty  Did they bring us schools and jobs   he asks   We only see them out there during elections   He adds that he voted for the Joint List the last time  but infighting broke it apart   For me  this ship has sunk   he says Yet Mr  Nafar s pro vote voice says that rather than the Titanic  he sees Arab politicians as the Mavi Marmara   the protest ship that tried to defy the Israeli blockade of Gaza in 2010  gaining international attention for the Palestinian cause   It doesn t make sense for me to give up a tool  when I hardly have any tools  so I m going to vote   he says The alternative  Mr  Nafar said in the interview  would be to allow

WASHINGTON   U S  Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to deter Russia from meddling in U S  elections by threatening stiff sanctions on its banking  energy and defense industries and sovereign debt The  Deter Act  is the latest effort by U S  lawmakers to increase pressure on Moscow over what they see as a range of bad behavior  from its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria s civil war to attempts to influence U S  elections The measure was introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen  a Democrat  and Marco Rubio  a Republican  They offered a similar measure last year  when it also had bipartisan support but was never brought up for a vote by the Senate s Republican leaders  who have close ties to President Donald Trump Trump has gone along with some previous congressional efforts to increase sanctions on Russia  although sometimes reluctantly  Backers of stronger action against Russia believe such measures will have better prospects in 2019  given control of the House of Representatives by Democrats  who are less reluctant than Trump s fellow Republicans to push back against the White House According to details of the legislation  first reported by Reuters  it would require the U S  Director of National Intelligence  DNI  to determine  within 30 days of any federal election  whether Russia or other foreign government or anyone acting as an agent of that government  had engaged in election interference If the DNI found such interference occurred  the act would require  among other things  that mandatory sanctions be imposed within 10 days on  among others  Russian banks and energy companies The act would mandate that sanctions be imposed on two or more of the following Russian banks  Sberbank  VTB Bank  Gazprombank  Vnesheconombank and Rosselkhozbank It also would order the prohibition of all transactions subject to U S  jurisdiction in Russian sovereign debt  Russian government bonds and the debt of any entity owned or controlled by Russia s government The sanctions would include blocking   freezing without seizing   any assets in the United States of those targeted for sanction  including senior Russian political figures and business leaders Russia denies trying to influence U S  elections  But U S  intelligence and law enforcement agencies have found that Moscow sought to intervene in the 2016 vote to boost Trump s chances of winning the White House An investigation by U S  Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not establish that members of Trump s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election  according to a summary released by U S  Attorney General William Barr last month The Deter Act is targeted at Russia but notes that U S  intelligence has identified China  Iran and North Korea as other major foreign government cyber threats  It also asks that Trump s administration present Congress with a strategy on preventing interference in U S  elections for each of those countries and other countries of significant concern The senators timed the bill s release to come after the end of Mueller s investigation  which has cast a shadow over the first two years of Trump s presidency  and just before an address to Congress by Jens Stoltenberg  secretary general of the NATO alliance  who has focused on the threat posed by Russia   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle  Editing by Peter Cooney and Bill Trott

CANBERRA   Australia s conservative government on Tuesday proposed tax cuts for low and middle income earners and record spending on health and education while promising the first budget surplus in more than a decade  shaping its pitch for votes in an imminent election Treasurer Josh Frydenberg offered A 158 billion  85 66 billion pounds  in tax cuts over the next decade primarily aimed at middle income earners  on top of tax cuts of A 144 billion last year  as the coalition government  which is trailing in opinion polls  tries to win over voters  An election must be held by mid May and could be called as soon as this week  The budget is back in the black  and Australia is back on track   Frydenberg told parliament in a budget speech on Tuesday evening  For the first time in 12 years  our nation is again paying its own way  Analysts long expected a spending plan designed to attract votes  It is the pre election budget to end all pre election budgets   it is extraordinarily generous   said Paul Williams  professor of political science at Griffith University There was muted reaction by the Australian dollar after the budget release  Earlier on Tuesday  it slid after the country s central bank held interest rates steady but still managed to sound dovish to some Standard   Poor s and Moody s left their top AAA ratings for Australia unchanged  S P said the country would achieve stronger fiscal outcomes than anticipated in the near term because of robust commodity prices and terms of trade  Moody s said strong employment growth supported the economy Frydenberg predicted a budget surplus of A 7 1 billion in the fiscal year ending June 2020  up from a December forecast of a A 4 1 billion surplus  as higher export receipts and tax revenues boost government coffers If achieved  it would be the first surplus since 2007 08  before the global financial crisis hit TAX REBATESThe projected surpluses increase to A 11 billion in 2020 21 and A 17 8 billion in 2021 22 before easing to A 9 2 billion in 2022 23  Offering potential swing voters an immediate dividend  the government said it will double the tax rebate for people earning between A 48 000 A 90 000 a year to A 1 080 in the current fiscal year Budget papers showed the cost of the tax cuts out to 2021 22 would be A 15 billion  Polls show the conservative Scott Morrison led government   consisting of the Liberal and rural focused National party   is headed for a resounding defeat against centre left Labour unless it can alter the current trajectory  Williams of Griffith University said the most the budget can do  is  stem the decline in support  The electorate has stopped listening   On Tuesday  Frydenberg also proposed changes in future years that would see income bands widened and tax rates reduced to deliver personal tax cuts The government would accelerate tax cuts for small businesses  it said  with the tax rate for businesses with turnover of less than A 50 million cut to 25 percent in 2021 22 The opposition Labour party said the budget would not address stagnant wage growth or tackle climate change Anaemic wages growth has been a hot political issue and is being used as an election platform for Labour and its supporters to campaign on The Australian Council of Trade Unions described wage growth forecasts in the budget  rising to 3 5 percent in 2021 22  as  fantasy  Strong inflows into government coffers meant Frydenberg could increase spending on healthcare  a strength of the opposition Labour party  to a record A 89 5 billion in 2022 23  That is up nearly 10 percent on expected spending in 2019 20 The government would spend A 100 billion on infrastructure over the next decade to reduce congestion and improve links between Australia s cities and regional towns  a lot of which has already been announced MORE RURAL ROADSSpending on rural infrastructure was forecast to rise by nearly 30 percent  with A 4 5 billion to go for building roads in rural areas  the major support base of the ruling coalition s junior partner The government also included an immediate one off rebate on energy costs to pensioners  another key voter demographic for the coalition  of A 75 for an individual or A 125 for couples And Frydenberg announced a A 3 5 billion package to reduce emissions to meet Australia s commitments under the Paris Accord  The government s environmental record is seen as one of its electoral weaknesses with urban voters  Frydenberg maintained a relatively optimistic outlook for the economy  though he conceded there were risks including from falling house prices and global ones such as Brexit  The government forecast full year economic growth of 2 25 percent in 2018 19  which would need activity to pick up in the January to June period as the economy grew 0 3 percent in the September quarter and 0 2 percent in the December quarter Growth in the A 1 9 trillion economy is seen picking up to 2 75 percent in 2019 20 and 2020 21 The tax cuts and increased spending  if enacted  could offer a boost to the economy  as consumer spending has been soft recently as falling home prices and high debt levels weigh on sentiment  Financial markets are fully pricing in a 25 basis points rate cut later this year  AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said there was some  fragility  around the budget assumptions  including downside risks to wage growth and consumer spending forecasts   It has provided stimulus but from what I can see it is not overwhelming   Oliver said  adding it was probably not enough to prevent Australia s central bank from cutting interest rates around mid 2019   Reporting by Colin Packham and Swati Pandey in CANBERRA  additional reporting by Tom Westbrook and Jonathan Barrett in SYDNEY  Editing by

WASHINGTON   Amid blowback from Capitol Hill  President Donald Trump switched gears again Wednesday  suggesting he never wanted Congress to vote to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election Trump s new tweets shifted his rationale for the  Obamacare  fight  First he said it was his choice to push off the health care votes  Then he said he never expected there to be any votes at all until after 2020 Trump claimed Wednesday he had never intended to reopen old wounds  But in keeping the issue at the forefront  the president put fresh attention on the GOP s long running and thus far unsuccessful effort to end ACA  I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me   the Republican Party   Trump tweeted  adding   I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election  That s not how congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader McConnell  understood Trump s sudden shift to the issue last week Nor did it stop Democrats from calling attention to the health care issue Wednesday The Democratic controlled House used a near party line 240 186 vote to condemn the Trump administration for joining a federal lawsuit aimed at annulling former President Barack Obama s health care law  Minutes later  the House Democrats  campaign organization launched digital ads in the districts of around 40 Democrats in competitive seats  saying they d  fought back  against GOP efforts to gut the statute s protections The GOP s bitter internal fight over health care in 2017 remains a sore subject for the president  He often retells the story of the late Arizona Sen  John McCain s  no  vote that killed the repeal and replace effort  Republicans  hit hard on health care issues during the 2018 midterm election  had no plans to take up the issue again before the next one Trump s fight was on display when he told Republican senators last week that his White House was developing a plan to replace the Obama health law  The sudden move stunned GOP leaders on Capitol Hill  While Trump wanted them to become  the party of health care   they feared it could be for all the wrong reasons if they were forced into a do over of the tough votes McConnell on Tuesday issued a rare public disclosure of his private counsel to the president  warning that another health care fight would be politically costly and doomed to fail now that Democrats control the House  The usually tight lipped leader said afterward that the president agreed to shelve his health care push until after the campaign  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters Tuesday Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week   backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  mindful that Republican unfulfilled promises to  repeal and replace  the Obama era law stand as a glaring failure of his administration  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   Trump said Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  After Trump said last week he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  McConnell faced a revolt from the ranks McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking    Associated Press writers Zeke Miller  Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram  Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar  Darlene Superville and Kevin Freking contributed to this report

Indian National Congress  many of which were publishing false information  Facebook also removed more than 100 fake pages and accounts controlled by the Pakistani military India   where the company has 340 million users  more than in any other country   poses distinct challenges  Posts and videos in more than a dozen languages regularly flummox Facebook s automated screening software and its human moderators  both of which are built largely around English  Many problematic posts come directly from candidates  political parties and the media  And on WhatsApp  where messages are encrypted  the company has little visibility into what is being shared How WhatsApp Leads Mobs to Murder in IndiaFalse rumors of child kidnappers have gone viral on WhatsApp in India  prompting fearful mobs to kill two dozen innocent people since April India s elections present a unique set of issues  including a large number of languages and an extended time period for voting   said Katie Harbath  Facebook s public policy head for global elections  She said the company had been planning for the election for more than a year Other major social media platforms like Twitter and Google s YouTube are also grappling with false news and hate speech around India s elections  For the first time  the country s Election Commission has asked online services to police election related content from candidates and parties But the stakes are especially high for Facebook  which has been under scrutiny since the 2016 United States presidential election for distributing misinformation and for being misused by Russian agents to stir discord  While the company survived the 2018 American midterm elections relatively unscathed  it still found foreign influence networks attempting to use it to sway voters  And Facebook s services were plagued by misinformation in last year s Mexican and Brazilian elections India is one of Facebook s most important electoral tests this year  company officials said  along with major elections in places including the Philippines and Indonesia  Facebook s performance will be a prelude for how it navigates a likely onslaught of propaganda  false information and foreign meddling during the 2020 presidential election in the United States ImageFacebook participated in an educational event to raise awareness about false news and the spread of misinformation at a school

right everywhere going forward   said Graham Brookie  director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council  a think tank working with Facebook to study disinformation campaigns India has been a laboratory for Facebook s election efforts since 2014  when the country last chose a Parliament  In that contest  Facebook worked closely with Mr  Modi s campaign to target ads and rally fans   part of a global effort to spread the use of the platform in politics  With Facebook s assistance  Mr  Modi became the world s No  2 most  liked  politician behind President Barack Obama  according to campaign officials After Mr  Modi s victory  Facebook advised him on how to use its service to govern  including getting government agencies and officials online  In 2015  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  hosted Mr  Modi for a televised chat at the company s Silicon Valley headquarters  Facebook held India up as a model for how governments could use the social network Facebook has since played down its connection to politicians around the world  including Mr  Modi  amid a rise in political misinformation  Ajit Mohan  a former Fox executive who became the social network s first India chief in January  said   We are absolutely not affiliated to any political party in India or anywhere else in the world  ImageAjit Mohan  a former Fox executive  was appointed Facebook s first chief of its India operations in January CreditVivek Singh for The New York TimesNow all the major Indian parties have sophisticated disinformation strategies  which include posting false and manipulated photos and videos and coordinating posts across a network of paid acolytes and volunteers  That has put Facebook  which has said it does not want to stifle free expression  in an awkward position For the past year  the company has relied on two independent organizations   first a local group called Boom and  more recently  the news agency Agence France Presse   to fact check a handful of posts in India every day  In February  Facebook added five more organizations to the stable and expanded the number of languages covered to seven  up from just English initially Facebook s algorithms flag potentially fake posts to the fact checkers  who decide which ones to investigate  After they publish their findings on Facebook  the company said  it reduces the visibility of false posts Yet some of Facebook s fact checkers may themselves be contributing to misinformation  Alt News  an Indian fact checking site unaffiliated with Facebook  recently found two of the social network s new partners   the large media houses India Today Group and Jagran Media Network   had repeatedly published false information related to the Kashmir attack Pratik Sinha  the founder of Alt News  said Facebook did not seem to view false news as a serious problem   The whole thing is a P R  effort   he said  Jency Jacob  the managing editor of Boom  said Facebook needed to do more  including making it easier for users to report misinformation ImageJency Jacob  managing editor of Boom  an Indian fact checking organization  said Facebook needed to do more to limit misinformation CreditAtul Loke for The New York TimesBalkrishna  who heads the fact checking effort at India Today  said that mistakes happened and that the company tried to correct them promptly  Pratyush Ranjan  a senior editor at Jagran New Media  the company s digital division  said its fact checking site  Vishvas News  operated separately and followed strict ethics guidelines  Facebook said it relied on the Poynter Institute  an American journalism organization  to certify its fact checkers and review their ethical standards A separate Facebook effort to assemble a broad coalition of Indian news organizations to combat false news during the election has been delayed amid funding problems and the departure of a key journalist who had worked on it The company has also tried to shed more light on political advertising on its site  posting weekly reports on top advertisers and how much they spent  Since Feb  21  when Facebook began tracking the data for India  spending has totaled about 103 million rupees  or about  1 5 million But the social network has not pushed for transparency on who is really paying for the ads  While the site s top three political advertisers in India were all associated with the B J P  s election efforts  none of them explicitly disclosed that affiliation to viewers India Election 2019  A Simple Guide to the World s Largest VoteHow does the election work  Will Modi win  What are the main issues facing India and its 900 million voters Facebook has also had difficulty dealing with hate speech  which is expected to intensify during the election For example  Raja Singh  a fiery right wing Hindu legislator in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad  refers to Muslims as  cow killers    an inflammatory phrase that has led to some deaths since the country s Hindu majority considers cows to be sacred  Although Facebook had removed some of Mr  Singh s posts for violating its hate speech rules  at least one threatening rant   in which he calls Muslims  dogs  and talks of cutting off their necks   remained on his official Facebook page for months Facebook removed the video  and then deleted Mr  Singh s Facebook page  after The New York Times inquired about it In an interview  Mr  Singh said he was simply defending Hindus from Muslims   It is imperative that we threaten them in our own style   he said Thenmozhi Soundararajan  the founder of Equality Labs  a human rights group in the United States  said her organization recently studied more than 1 000 Facebook posts that attacked caste and religious minorities  It found that 80 percent of the posts stayed on the social network after they were reported as hate speech  and nearly half of the posts that were initially removed were up again several months later Mr  Mohan said Facebook recognized that it had more work to do  It recently decided to set up an election  war room  in India to better respond to problems  This will evolve and continue to get better   he said   There is a tremendous amount of sincerity that we need to get this right

BANGKOK   Thailand s military junta is targeting a popular new pro democracy party  accusing its leader of causing disorder that could lead to rebellion even as the seat allotments from last week s parliamentary elections are being calculated The billionaire leader of the Future Forward Party  Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  was ordered on Wednesday to submit to the police for questioning in the case  which initially opened four years ago  He is accused of helping protesters flee arrest at a demonstration and faces up to seven years in prison Mr  Thanathorn  who has built a large following partly through social media  posted the summons on Facebook and Twitter and wrote   When the dark power won t leave Future Forward alone   It s clear now that the old school political game won t end after the election  but is only getting more intense  because they re afraid of Future Forward   he added  The party came in third in the balloting last week The summons came Wednesday  a day after Thailand s Army chief  Gen  Apirat Kongsompong  warned that the military would not tolerate threats against the country s constitutional monarchy  in which the king is deemed head of state  Some considered his comments to be directed at Future Forward  The army does the army s duty  which is to protect  maintain  and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy   the general told reporters The interventions are the latest indications that the Thai junta is clinging to every advantage it can to gain an edge through the election  And the junta gave itself many of those advantages  as it put in place a new Constitution and electoral system after seizing power in a 2014 coup Those changes gave the generals sweeping influence over Parliament itself  and over an Election Commission with great power to bar candidates and target lawmakers for ejection ImageRepresentatives of the Pheu Thai and the Future Forward parties during a meeting after the election last month  The opposition coalition  including Pheu Thai and Future Forward  claimed on Wednesday that it would have a razor thin majority in the House CreditGemunu Amarasinghe Associated PressThe first electoral test for that new system came last week when Thailand finally held its long delayed parliamentary election  And though the results are not yet official  it is already clear that the regime s system is doing what it was designed to do  splintering the pro democracy opposition  and entrenching the junta s authority  Thailand is headed to a military guided  authoritarian system   said Purawich Watanasukh  a research fellow at the independent King Prajadhipok s Institute in Bangkok According to the Election Commission s preliminary results  the leading vote getter was the military backed party  Palang Pracharat  with about 24 percent  But that is less than half the popular vote received by the next three parties  which all campaigned for a return to democracy  In total  they received 51 percent of the vote  according to the early count  Palang Pracharat ran on the idea of maintaining stability and continuity and the others ran on the basis of restoring democracy   said Verapat Pariyawong  a visiting scholar at SOAS School of Law at the University of London   The majority of Thai voters went for the idea that we need to restore democracy  In parliament s lower house  the House of Representatives  the likely result will be a sharply divided body and a weak coalition government  The commission has until May 9 to announce the official results Calling itself the National Council for Peace and Order after it seized power  the junta drafted a new Constitution  the country s 20th  which was ratified in a 2016 referendum  For that vote  the junta blocked opponents from campaigning and barred election monitors Voters approved a separate measure allowing the military to appoint all 250 members of the Senate  who will join the 500 member lower house in selecting the next prime minister Critics contend that the entire system is rigged in the military s favor  That is partly through its influence over the powerful Election Commission  which came under fire for numerous irregularities during the balloting  delays in announcing the vote count  and an unexpected surge in the number of votes reported At one news conference  the commission s president  Ittiporn Boonpracong  told reporters that he could not work out the party list percentages because he did not have a calculator with him ImageDozens of protesters gathered in Bangkok on Sunday to protest the Election Commission s handling of the vote and what they termed cheating CreditLauren Decicca Getty ImagesAt another  the commission released 208 pages of election data and told reporters to figure out the seat allocations themselves Initial delays prompted the United States State Department to call for transparency  We stand with the Thai people in calling for the expeditious announcement of voting results and a fair and transparent investigation of any reported irregularities   a State Department spokesman  Robert Palladino  said last week More than 5 6 percent of the votes cast were invalidated  including some for not being marked properly  If they had gone to a single party  that party would have finished sixth over all Another 24 percent of the votes were spread among more than 70 other parties  fulfilling the military s goal of fragmenting the vote In the 2011 parliamentary election  more than three quarters of the vote went to two parties  Pheu Thai and the Democrat Party  which finished second and fourth in last week s election   An election held in 2014 was ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court  The military has another edge  as well  the timing of the coronation of a new monarch  King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun  expected May 4 to 6 That is only a few days before the election results become official  And the effect  in a country with strict laws against criticizing the monarchy  has been to make pro democracy leaders reluctant to stage any major protests before the coronation Dozens of protesters did gather on Sunday afternoon to protest the Election Commission s handling of the vote and what they termed cheating Still  the military may have to use even more tactics to fully secure a win Under complex rules that do not necessarily reward winning the most votes  Palang Pracharat will hold about 118 seats in the House while the opposition Pheu Thai Party is likely to get about 137  according to unofficial projections ImageCasting votes in Bangkok on election day  The Election Commission has until May 9 to announce the official results CreditWason Wanichakorn Associated PressThe opposition coalition  including Pheu Thai and Future Forward  claimed on Wednesday that it would have a razor thin majority in the House But under the country s new Constitution  and an accompanying body of law that followed it  the deck is stacked against them Since the next prime minister will be chosen by a combined vote of the House and the military appointed Senate  it is likely that the junta leader and current prime minister  Prayuth Chan ocha  will be named to head the new government And whatever the outcome of the vote  the Constitution gives the military the authority to shape Parliament s membership in the months and years ahead The Election Commission can seek to remove members for election misconduct and call new elections in those seats  in some circumstances barring the previous winner from running again  More than 180 such complaints have been filed  They have the whole year to disqualify people   said Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee  a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok   So the number can be changed the whole time  In addition  Mr  Verapat  the University of London visiting scholar  pointed out that the Constitution gives military appointed officials the power to remove members of Parliament any time for violating broad  ethical standards  The standards include adhering to democracy with the king as the head of state  pursuing the public interest over private interests and conducting oneself in an honest manner Government officials and courts will have wide discretion under the law to decide what violates the ethics standards  he said  Even if the so called democratic coalition was able to form a government   Mr  Verapat added   they would face a tough road ahead   

ISTANBUL   Even before the important election of Istanbul s mayor has been settled  the opposition candidate  who claims to have won  is challenging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by pressing ahead with his promise to have an independent audit of the city s books Mr  Erdogan and his party have been in control of the city since 2002  and analysts and opponents say they have warped the economy through kickbacks and crony schemes  There has not  however  been real proof of this Now  Mr  Erdogan s party is demanding a recount of the vote  The opposition candidate  Ekrem Imamoglu  says this is a delaying tactic  And  at a news briefing on Wednesday  he said the party was trying to erase town hall records from computers before he takes over and brings in independent auditors to examine the city s books His promise of an audit dramatically raises the stakes for Mr  Erdogan  who was confronted with a stunning electoral defeat Sunday night  when his Justice and Development Party  or AKP  was shown to be losing the contests for mayor in both Ankara and Istanbul At the Wednesday news briefing  Mr  Imamoglu said he had evidence that the Istanbul municipality had applied to a technical company for help in deleting data from its computers  In comments on Tuesday he had appealed to city workers to do the correct thing and not destroy government property  There are many issues   he said   When the day comes  once authorized  we will go there and we will start sharing them with the public  Mr  Imamoglu said he wanted the audit to examine not only the municipality s budget  but also private companies that serve as subsidiaries and partners to the municipality  This is the soft belly of AKP   Bahadir Ozgur  a business columnist  wrote Tuesday in the online newspaper Gazete Duvar The  AKP style municipal work  would end  he added  when independent auditors entered the town hall and  name by name expose how much money was transferred to whom  whose relative  brother  uncle won which bid  Mr  Erdogan s party has yet to cede to the opposition  and the High Election Council has yet to certify the results of Sunday s election  Opposition officials have said the legal process could take a week or more Mr  Imamoglu demanded a swift declaration of the results   We want justice   he said on Wednesday   We want our election certificate  ImageBillboards reading  Thank You Istanbul  had been put up on behalf of President Erdogan and his party  so confident were they of success in Sunday s mayoral vote  Current tallies show they lost CreditBulent Kilic Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesHe accused the AKP of playing for time and suggested the delaying tactics were partly to clean traces of their misdeeds  He promised new rules of transparency and international standards of accounting when he took over  This process here absolutely requires transparency   he told a news briefing on Monday   If you are going to govern Istanbul  which is a city of 16 million  you have to develop an exemplary model  and this is what I am aiming for  Mr  Imamoglu s opponent  former Prime Minister Binali Yidlirim  accused him Wednesday evening of trying to gain support abroad by stirring controversy   You do not have the right to tamper with the nerves of the nation   he said Mr  Erdogan had surprised many with the ferocity of his campaign in the local elections in Istanbul and Ankara  and some analysts have pointed to the importance of the big cities as a source of wealth for his network of family and friends Huge billboards of Mr  Erdogan and his candidate for Istanbul mayor  Binali Yildirim  thanking the public for their votes  have gone up around the city since Sunday night  a sign the party had been confident that their candidate would win  What makes the loss heavy is actually a secret known by everyone   Cigdem Toker  an investigative reporter with the fiercely opposition newspaper  Sozcu  wrote in a column on Wednesday She added that Istanbul and Ankara were important to Mr  Erdogan s party because  they are the centers of distributing financial resources   We are talking about tens of thousands of bids  public resources that can be identified with hundreds of billions  and the authority to spend them   wrote Ms  Toker  who is facing several court cases brought by Mr  Erdogan s government for her investigative reporting A new administration in Istanbul could end the flow of major city contracts for construction projects and city services that have been granted to favored businessmen A new administration could also end payments worth millions of dollars to endowments of charities and foundations run by the Erdogan family In January  Ms  Toker published details of payments made in 2018 by the Istanbul metropolitan municipality to foundations and charities run by Mr  Erdogan s children and their spouses Ms  Toker wrote that TUGVA  the Turkish Youth Foundation  received 74 million lira  or approximately  13 million by current exchange rates  that year from the municipality  Bilal Erdogan  Mr  Erdogan s younger son  sits on TUGVA s board ImagePresident Erdogan at a news conference in Istanbul on Sunday CreditMurad Sezer ReutersThe Archers Foundation  an archery sports club  received 16 million lira  or about  2 million  she reported  Bilal Erdogan sat on the board  she reported at the time  He has been widely known for his association with the foundation  although his name no longer appears on its website TURGEV  the Turkey Youth and Education Service Foundation  received 51 million lira  or about  9 million  she said  Esra Albayrak  Mr  Erdogan s daughter  is on its board The Turkey Technology Team Foundation  known as T3  where Mr  Erdogan s son in law Selcuk Bayraktar is head of the board  received 41 million lira or about  7 million  she also reported Her source for all of the payments was the 2018 Istanbul Municipality Report  which was not made public  underscoring Mr  Erdogan s sensitivity to the wider disclosure of such documents by the opposition Mr  Erdogan s signature success has been construction projects  from public residential building to infrastructure projects and expensive megaprojects like bridges and mosques  Opponents say that government contracts go to favored business partners  and that the AKP receives payments in a system of kickbacks from every deal Both the Ankara and Istanbul municipalities are heavily in debt  Mr  Ozgur warned in his column  and they may suffer if Mr  Erdogan  who controls the national budget  refuses them central government funds as punishment for the way they voted on Sunday Mr  Imamoglu  who announced his plans for Istanbul to international reporters Monday night  said he was prepared for that retribution and was confident Istanbul could generate enough of its own money to run itself He added that he had received indications of support from high within Turkey s state apparatus  if not in the lower ranks of the government  where support for Mr  Erdogan remains strong As president  Mr  Erdogan retains sweeping powers and could make life difficult for the incoming mayors  said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli  the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States  The AKP will control the municipal councils  and they have a say in particular in how the budget is allocated   he said  This control over the purse strings has long been a source of support for Mr  Erdogan and his party Ms  Toker reported Wednesday that there were signs already that the government was seeking ways to maintain control of resources  The Interior Ministry was taking steps to shift the approval of bids above a certain amount from municipal authorities to Mr  Erdogan s personal control  she wrote  In this way when it comes to investments in opposition controlled municipalities  the decision will be made in Bestepe   she wrote  a reference to the presidential palace

ISTANBUL   Step by step over the years  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey sought to ensure nobody could challenge him  He marginalized adversaries  He purged the army  the police and the courts  He cowed the press  He strengthened his powers in the Constitution  And he promised Turks a bright economic future So it was a huge surprise when the outcome of weekend municipal voting showed on Monday that Mr  Erdogan s party had not only lost control of Ankara  the political center  but maybe Istanbul  the country s commercial center  his home city and longstanding core of support Even if the results were not final  they amounted to the most momentous political earthquake to shake Mr  Erdogan in nearly two decades of basically uncontested control at the helm of Turkey  a NATO ally and critical linchpin of stability in the region  Erdogan s party plans to challenge election losses in Istanbul and Ankara  What was different this time was the rapidly tanking economy and a highly disciplined opposition It deployed monitors to not only scrutinize the vote tallies but also sleep on sacks of sealed counted ballots to guard against possible tampering by members of Mr  Erdogan s ruling Justice and Development Party  the AKP  We think they were not able to rig the election   said Ilayda Kocoglu  28  vice president of the Istanbul branch of the opposition Republican People s Party  or CHP  who slept on some sacks herself   They were not expecting us to be that organized  or that resolved  The results do not mean that Mr  Erdogan  whose term as president lasts for four more years  will change his behavior  which includes promoting Islamic religious values over secularism  closer ties to Russia and chillier relations with NATO  But the election showed Mr  Erdogan has weaknesses  It s a catastrophe for him   said Asli Aydintasbas  a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations   We now know he is not invincible  ImagePresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey arriving for a news conference in Istanbul  his home base of support CreditBulent Kilic Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesTurkey s weakened economy  which had rapidly expanded for years under Mr  Erdogan  was at the top of voters  concerns  despite Mr  Erdogan s exhortations that the problems are not of his making  The country tumbled into a recession in March  Unemployment exceeds 10 percent  and up to 30 percent among young people  The Turkish lira lost 28 percent of its value in 2018 and continues to weaken  Inflation has reached 20 percent Ms  Kocoglu said she and her colleagues understood within an hour of the closing of polls Sunday night that they were watching Turkey s most momentous change since Mr  Erdogan took power  Even the most remote areas of the Istanbul metropolitan area showed a defeat for Mr  Erdogan s mayoral candidate As of Monday night  results from the High Election Council had still not been fully released and Mr  Erdogan s party had not conceded defeat in Istanbul  But the tally showed the opposition candidate  Ekrem Imamoglu  ahead with 99 percent of the votes counted At a late night news briefing in Istanbul  Mr  Imamoglu said he was trusting in Turkey s institutions more than the AKP to confirm his victory   I don t expect this from the party   he said   For years to come AKP will not accept my win  Opposition mayors in Turkey s two most important cities give the Republican People s Party high profile opportunities to show how it can govern effectively  with control of municipal services from garbage collection to mass transit  And Mr  Imamoglu has promised that as mayor of Istanbul  he would audit the books  a prospect that could create new problems for the AKP should he uncover evidence of corruption under the ruling party s watch The Republican People s Party  long criticized for a lack of organization  for once was well prepared for the election  Mr  Imamoglu  49  a former district mayor  mobilized thousands of volunteers to observe every ballot box in the greater metropolitan area and record the count on a specially designed application  giving the party its own independent tabulation  We were able to compare our numbers with theirs   Ms  Kocoglu said A decisive moment came at 9 p m  Sunday when Mr  Erdogan gave his first speech of the evening  claiming victory for the AKP overall in the municipal district elections  The election commission suddenly stopped releasing election results for Istanbul  as did the semiofficial Anadolu news agency  which is widely followed on election nights as the source favored by the government for results The president s camp had already seen which way the vote was going and had stopped the count  said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli  the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States  a research institute   They stopped it to think what they could do   he said  There was even discussion of some kind of intervention  he said ImageEkrem Imamoglu  mayoral candidate for Istanbul of Republican People s Party  CHP   speaking after votes were cast  He was leading the race   a significant blow for the party in power CreditLefteris Pitarakis Associated Press We were very afraid   Ms  Kocoglu said  She recalled several elections when the election commission had stopped releasing details in the count  only to resume later and show an unlikely jump in favor of the ruling party Opposition supporters say this happened in a previous election for mayor of Ankara  and during the count for the 2017 constitutional referendum that gave Mr  Erdogan more executive powers and even in the presidential election in June The CHP s efforts to tabulate its own count in 2018 failed when the party s computer system broke down midcount  Its candidate later conceded defeat But this time was different  When Mr  Erdogan s candidate  Binali Yildirim  a former prime minister  declared himself the winner in Istanbul  Mr  Imamoglu immediately went public  announcing that he was leading in the race and had the records to prove it  He made 10 public statements of his lead through the night Mr  Erdogan is responsible for what many critics call an imperial presidency in Turkey  He oversaw a severe repression and government purging after a failed 2016 military coup attempt that he blamed on a longtime rival in exile  Fethullah Gulen  a cleric who lives in the United States  Under Mr  Erdogan  Turkey also has been a leading jailer of journalists But Mr  Erdogan s domination as Turkey s leader is also attributed to his unquestioned political talents and the failure of the main opposition party to put forward good candidates and broaden its appeal  CHP supporters have often questioned why their leaders have seemed to hand election after election to Mr  Erdogan The determination of the opposition was one thing  but support across society and even inside Mr  Erdogan s own party appeared to waver in the latest vote  The opposition stood firm  and there were signs of a public unleashing   Mr  Unluhisarcikli said  describing strong public support on Twitter and other social media ImageThe Istanbul mayoral candidate

Ankara and conceded the loss of at least one city to the opposition   a huge setback by itself Then people inside Mr  Erdogan s party headquarters posted screenshots taken from AKP computer monitors showing the opposition candidate in Istanbul leading the race  Mr  Erdogan s own supporters were apparently leaking the information  said Ms  Aydintasbas at the European Council for Foreign Relations Mr  Erdogan has become increasingly aloof over the years  surrounded in his vast presidential palace by a smaller and smaller circle of aides and ministers Yet political analysts were in little doubt that he made the decision to allow the true results for the Istanbul vote to be released Monday morning in order to protect his own electoral legacy  Erdogan is not a crazy person  he is intelligent   Ms  Kocoglu said Ms  Aydintasbas said Mr  Erdogan  who has always drawn legitimacy from the ballot box  would have seen it was impossible to alter the result   There was no real way   she said   They did not find a way of doing it without losing legitimacy  Others said Mr  Erdogan knew the risks to the economy if there were a wrangle over the election or a protracted dispute  The lira could fall sharply  as it did last summer  with drastic repercussions for businesses and livelihoods By accepting the election result  Mr  Erdogan has saved the reputation of the Turkish electoral system  which has given him legitimacy over the last 17 years  Mr  Unluhisarcikli said   With this one election Erdogan has dispensed the clouds of doubt of all the past elections  The swing away from Mr  Erdogan and his party in his home city  a place that he often describes with love and emotion  showed an unexpected success from the opposition alliance  which persuaded voters to vote tactically  despite their differences  Votes from the minority Kurds  and from unhappy conservatives who abandoned Mr  Erdogan  were critical  said Ms  Aydintasbas  who has followed Mr  Erdogan s career closely Ms  Kocoglu said that the election was a critical victory for the opposition since no further elections are scheduled for four years  I still cannot believe it   she said   When AKP came to power I was in middle school  I have never seen a victory   

Just when it seemed that democracy was all but dead in Turkey  voters delivered a sharp electoral rebuke to their authoritarian president  Recep Tayyip Erdogan Unofficial results in municipal elections over the weekend show that Mr  Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party lost control of Ankara  the capital  and Istanbul  the financial center and launching pad for Mr  Erdogan s political career Mr  Erdogan was not on the ballot  and his party still controls Parliament  but the vote was the worst election defeat of his nearly two decades in office  And while he won re election last year  a 2017 referendum that only narrowly gave him new authority over the legislature and judiciary presaged his weakening support Opposition candidates in the municipal races capitalized on growing discontent with his repression and economic mismanagement  The results signaled that  if the opposition stays united and forward looking  it could mount a true challenge to Mr  Erdogan in the next presidential election  in 2023 The president s main rival  the Republican People s Party  and its allies promised political change  job creation  better education and improved social services  Opposition members carefully monitored vote tallies and have even slept on sacks of counted ballots to ensure they are not tampered with by Erdogan loyalists Meanwhile  the pro Kurdish People s Democratic Party s disciplined effort in the bigger cities to support Republican People s Party candidates most likely provided the winning margin in Istanbul and Ankara For more than a decade  Mr  Erdogan has dominated Turkey  promoting Islamic religious values and ruthlessly crushing those he sees as adversaries  Over the years  he has manipulated the system to accrue sweeping executive powers  control the army and crack down on civil liberties  His cronies largely control the media  but Turkey still jails more journalists than any other nation The president inserted himself directly into the local election process  handpicking a longtime ally  Binali Yildirim  to run for mayor of Istanbul and choosing a former minister to run for mayor of Ankara  Their losses could deprive the president of a vast patronage apparatus that has bolstered his rule  Appearing at as many as eight political rallies a day  Mr  Erdogan waged an aggressively negative campaign  accusing the opposition of criminality or terrorism  threatening lawsuits and fueling nationalist anger It s not surprising that voters saw the election as a referendum on Mr  Erdogan s rule  Turkey s economy fell into recession in March after years of enviable growth  The unemployment rate is now over 10 percent  and is as much as 30 percent among young people  In 2018  the value of the Turkish lira fell 28 percent  Inflation is at 20 percent  Voters  particularly the young  are also concerned about corruption among members of the Erdogan family and its allies  Mr  Erdogan s party is challenging the vote counts but said it would respect the results  despite his autocratic bent  Mr  Erdogan values the legitimacy that elections confer The United States and other Western democracies had been losing hope that Turkey can be a reliable ally given Mr  Erdogan s drift away from democratic values and NATO and toward Russia  The latest election results offer a chance to assure him that any tampering would widen that breach   and further endanger economic and military partnerships  One concern is that Mr  Erdogan could try to increase his flagging support by undertaking long threatened military operations against America s Kurdish allies in Syria  Such a move may backfire  particularly if the operations go poorly Especially now that Turkey s political opposition has shown it is alive and capable of pushing back  Opinion   Selim KoruHas Erdogan s Populism Reached Its Limits April 2  2019Erdogan  Turkey s Leader  Staring at Major Electoral DefeatMarch 31  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

CHICAGO   Adrianne Burton  38  believes that the next mayor of Chicago will have a sharper  more empathetic eye on the public schools  Carolyn Davenport  62  is confident that the new mayor will be a superior manager  accustomed to running a career and a household without any fuss On her lunch break in the Loop  Denise Thompson  54  had a different view   We re making history  sure   she said   But a black woman running the city will be just like anybody else  On Tuesday  Chicagoans were headed to the polls to vote for a successor to Mayor Rahm Emanuel  Residents were choosing between two African American women  guaranteeing that Chicago will become the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  Read more about the Chicago election for mayor that resulted in a win for Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to run the city  Competing in the runoff election are Lori Lightfoot  a lawyer and former federal prosecutor  and Toni Preckwinkle  the president of the Cook County Board and the chairwoman of the county s Democratic Party  Both women beat out 12 other candidates in an election in February  a who s who of well known names that made up the most crowded ballot in municipal history As the voting began  the historic nature of the election was greeted in Chicago with both pride and nonchalance  a sense that electing an African American woman as mayor would be significant  but not seismic  Here s more on Chicago s election  Maybe it is because Chicago has already seen such milestones  sending the first African American president  Barack Obama  to the White House  helping elect the first African American woman to the United States Senate  Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois  in 1992  and making Harold Washington the city s first black mayor in 1983  It is tremendous   said Josie Brown Childs  a civic leader who worked for Mr  Washington in the 1980s   But Chicago has been on the forefront of certain black politics  whether it was with Harold or Obama  We ve been in the lead on those things  In interviews around the city during the run up to the election  Chicagoans said they were carefully weighing the platforms and promises of Ms  Preckwinkle and Ms  Lightfoot  watching their performances in televised debates and considering what kind of leader the current moment in Chicago demands ImageJosie Brown Childs  a civic leader who worked for Harold Washington in the 1980s  at her South Shore home CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York Times For me  personally  I m asking   Who is going to be the break from politics as usual in Chicago    said Jordie Davies  a Ph D  candidate at the University of Chicago whose dissertation focuses on political activism   I m excited about two black women  But I m looking at records  I m looking at who is going to offer the most holistic platform for addressing problems in Chicago  Deidre Baumann  50  a lawyer who cast her vote Tuesday at a library in the Budlong Woods neighborhood on the North Side  said she would be happy with whichever candidate prevailed  Either way  this is a historic election   she said She watched the debates and studied the candidates  records carefully  she said  deciding in the end to vote for Ms  Lightfoot  who she believed would bring her experience as a federal prosecutor to push for criminal justice reform  Here s what you need to know about Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago and the first openly gay mayor for the city   We have to make this city safe for all the citizens and the police   Ms  Baumann said   On the other hand  we cannot continue to incarcerate black and brown people in disparate numbers  In her eyes  Ms  Preckwinkle represented an older political model   I m disturbed a bit by her ties to the machine   she said   She always touted herself as the progressive candidate  She s had to move away from that as she navigated the political system in Chicago  The new mayor must contend with a host of complicated issues in the nation s third largest city  including a deep pension crisis  persistent violent crime  reform of the police department and the question of how to spur investment and growth in long neglected and segregated neighborhoods on Chicago s West and South Sides  Under Mr  Emanuel  the downtown has boomed  flourishing with tech companies  high rise hotels  a sparkling riverfront and luxury apartments  But many African American residents have moved out of the city in recent years  Mr  Emanuel  who was elected to two terms  did not seek a third term in office Polls have suggested that Ms  Lightfoot has a commanding lead over Ms  Preckwinkle  who entered the race last September after Mr  Emanuel announced that he would not run again  Ms  Preckwinkle garnered endorsements from powerful labor groups   the Chicago Teachers Union and the Service Employees International Union   and from prominent black leaders including Jesse White  the secretary of state In the part of Chicago s South Side that Ms  Preckwinkle once represented in the City Council  voters remembered her tenure fondly  Bob Kurth  76  a longtime resident of the Kenwood neighborhood  said Ms  Preckwinkle came through years ago when he complained about a hole in the street near his condo building  She was approachable  If you had a problem that was part of the ward  you called her and you had a meeting with her   Mr  Kurth said on Tuesday after voting for Ms  Preckwinkle   You saw her on the street  she always had time to talk to you  ImageLori Lightfoot and Toni Preckwinkle before the start of their final on air debate CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York TimesMs  Preckwinkle s long stint in government was not a deterrent  With Toni  she didn t start as a politician  and that means a lot to me   said Mr  Kurth  a retired salesman   She s learned how to play the game  but I don t consider her a part of it  Others saw Ms  Preckwinkle s years in political office as a concern  The fact Ms  Lighftoot had not served in elective office helped her earn the vote of Michelle Saulnier  29  a Ph D  student  It s a good thing  especially in Chicago where there s known to be a lot of corruption   Ms  Saulnier said after casting her ballot in the Logan Square neighborhood  where Ms  Lightfoot lives and her campaign signs abound   I think that s really important to try to break some of these cycles that we re in    Ms  Lightfoot had a head start on the campaign trail  declaring her candidacy for mayor in May 2018  when it was widely believed that she would face off against Mr  Emanuel A relatively unknown figure who has never held elective office  Ms  Lightfoot has spent time introducing herself to voters as a candidate who would focus on overhauling the police department  curbing street violence and rebuilding neighborhoods beyond the affluent downtown and North Side  Ra Joy  an entrepreneur in Chicago who was a candidate for lieutenant governor in 2018  endorsed Ms  Lightfoot early in the race  he said on Saturday at a candidate forum at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition on the South Side A mayoral contest between two African American women has scrambled the usual political calculus in Chicago  or what Mr  Joy called  tribal voting   in which politicians could count on support from voters of their own race  It s turned that notion on its head   he said  adding that the successful candidate would have to build coalitions of Latinos  whites and African Americans in a city where the population is almost evenly divided among the three groups Celestine A  Strain  46  a hospital technician  brought her granddaughter Kalicia  9  to the forum at Rainbow PUSH  hoping Kalicia would someday remember seeing two black women running for mayor of Chicago  It s amazing for her to see   Ms  Strain said  adding that she was hoping Ms  Preckwinkle  who has been a familiar face in county government for years  would emerge victorious on Tuesday   I really believe that she has the right experience  The Rev  Jesse Jackson offered no endorsement in the race  saying that he hoped to be more of a peacemaker after what played out in recent weeks as a bitter campaign  On stage on Saturday  he urged both candidates to sign a statement agreeing to appear together the morning after the election   I wanted to play a reconciling role   Mr  Jackson said in an interview in his office at Rainbow PUSH   The campaign ends  Let the healing begin   

KIEV  Ukraine   A young television comic and novice candidate trounced Ukraine s political elite in the first round of the presidential election  official results showed Monday   a stinging rebuke by an electorate tired of the lack of change in a country dominated by rich businessmen With the initial vote tally nearly complete  results released by the Central Electoral Committee showed that Volodymyr Zelensky  41  who is famous for playing a schoolteacher accidentally vaulted into the presidency  leading the field with more than 30 percent  He received 5 2 million votes  almost double the number of his nearest competitor  President Petro O  Poroshenko  who had just under 16 percent Yulia V  Tymoshenko  a former prime minister who has run for president twice before  came in third with more than 13 percent  The turnout was more than 63 percent in an electorate of 30 million  the electoral commission said Since no candidate garnered more than 50 percent of the vote  Mr  Zelensky and the apparent second place finisher  Mr  Poroshenko  will face each other in a runoff in three weeks  on April 21 As soon as the polls closed on Sunday and exit polls indicated that there would be a runoff  the two leading candidates began bashing each other Mr  Zelensky presented himself as an insurgent facing a tired old guard that had refused to take him seriously  He walloped a field of 38 other candidates representing different political blocs in Ukraine  most of whom attracted only small fractions of the vote ImageYulia Tymoshenko after a news conference in her election headquarters in Kiev on Monday CreditOleg Petrasyuk EPA  via ShutterstockA Zelensky adviser described the outcome as the culmination of a series of uprisings in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014 that succeeded in overthrowing governments but failed to break the grip of the oligarchs who control economic and political life  as well as the media  This is a struggle so that the political system finally starts working not for its own benefit  but for the benefit of the people   said Dmitri Razumkov  a political consultant for Mr  Zelensky   Despite two revolutions  nothing has changed in our country  Mr  Zelensky has been vague about what he would do as president  and at one point tried to crowdsource his program by suggesting that supporters contribute thoughts via social media  Voters might demand more in the second round There have also been suspicions that he is a front for Ihor V  Kolomoisky  a Ukrainian tycoon who fled to Israel amid a banking scandal  Both men have denied any secret pact Mr  Poroshenko  53  conceded on Sunday night that he had lost the confidence of young voters weary over the slow pace of change and the continuing economic woes  But he said that the time for joking was over and that Ukraine needed a leader who could confront both its socioeconomic problems and  more important  the conflict with Russia The election will help determine the course of the country that has become the European fault line in renewed global tensions between Russia and the West  The war for control of the Donbass  the regions in eastern Ukraine where government forces are fighting Russian backed separatists  has claimed 13 000 lives and displaced millions since 2014 In a sign of the deep rift with Russia  the main rivalry in the presidential race was not  unlike a decade ago  between pro Russian and pro Western factions  The leading ally of Russia this time  Yuriy Boyko  was in fourth place  with over 11 percent of the vote ImagePresident Petro O  Poroshenko came in second in the first round of voting CreditReutersMr  Poroshenko faces an uphill battle in a runoff  political analysts said  not least because he remains one of the wealthiest men in Ukraine  His wealth comes from his chocolate empire  and he did not fulfill a 2014 campaign promise to sell his business  Various businessmen close to him have been caught up in scandals involving corruption The president continued to grow richer as ordinary Ukrainians suffered from low wages and unemployment  noted Volodymr Fesenko  a political analyst The election outcome echoes a global trend of tossing out established political leaders in favor of candidates who promise a complete national overhaul  Mr  Fesenko and other analysts said  The victory of Zelensky is a protest against the old elites and the request for radical political change  a radical update   said Mr  Fesenko  chairman of a think tank called the  Center for Applied Political Studies  It is not so much love for the comedian as  the expectation that he can become a catalyst for change   he said Ukrainians seem less enamored of their leaders all the time  A mere 9 percent voiced confidence in the government  and 91 percent see it as corrupt  according to a Gallup poll conducted in March In Russia  Dmitri S  Peskov  the spokesman for President Vladimir V  Putin  declined to comment on the first round voting results  Russia s main interest is seeing a candidate prevail who will work toward a gradual settlement of the conflict in Donbass  he said Other Russian political leaders and the state run media tried to present the Ukrainian election as a farce and a rebuke to the idea that a political uprising like that in Ukraine in 2014 could force change  Rossiyskaya Gazeta  the government newspaper  said there were signs of  massive violations and falsifications in these elections   the dirtiest and most dishonest in the history of Ukraine  The Russian reports and commentary ignored the widespread perception that the election in Ukraine was democratic  with a real choice and an outcome that was not preordained   unlike elections in Russia  Only minor election law violations have been reported thus far  

CHICAGO   After Rahm Emanuel announced he would not seek another term as Chicago s mayor  the field of would be replacements seemed to grow by the day  Lori Lightfoot  a former federal prosecutor who had never held elective office  often seemed an afterthought in a mounting list of prominent names   a member of the Daley political dynasty  the head of the county s Democratic Party  a former leader of Chicago s public school system Yet on Tuesday  voters sided with Ms  Lightfoot in overwhelming margins  handing her a resounding victory as she prepares to become the first African American woman and first openly gay person to serve as Chicago s mayor  Ms  Lightfoot s outsider status and her pledge to combat political corruption resonated across the city s traditional dividing lines of race and class  With 97 percent of precincts reporting  she had received 73 percent of the vote and was leading in all 50 City Council wards  Today  you did more than make history   Ms  Lightfoot told a packed ballroom of her supporters that chanted her name on Tuesday night   You created a movement for change   Read how Chicago became the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  and how Chicagoans feel about it  Ms  Lightfoot  a Democrat  used her acceptance speech to underscore the historic nature of her victory  As her wife and daughter stood nearby  Ms  Lightfoot said her win proved that Chicago was  a city where it doesn t matter what color you are  and  where it doesn t matter who you love  just as long as you love with all your heart   She also reiterated her promise to invest in struggling neighborhoods  not just the booming downtown  a hallmark theme of her campaign pitch  We can and will make Chicago a place where your ZIP code doesn t determine your destiny   she said Ms  Lightfoot finished with the most support among 14 candidates in February s first round  nonpartisan election  In Tuesday s runoff  she broadened that appeal and soundly defeated Toni Preckwinkle  a longtime politician who leads the county board and local Democratic Party  The two women will soon have offices in the same building  and have vowed to work together despite a campaign that was often acrimonious In the Logan Square neighborhood on the city s Northwest Side  Deepti Pareenja  37  said she voted for Ms  Lightfoot on Tuesday in part because of the candidate s lack of political experience ImageMs  Lightfoot campaigned with supporters last week  She presented herself on the campaign trail as an antidote to Rahm Emanuel s eight years in office and as an answer to the city s far longer tradition of machine politics CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York Times It s because of Chicago   Ms  Pareenja said   We have a history of corruption with people who ve been ingrained in politics for multiple decades  Ms  Pareenja said she also voted for Ms  Lightfoot in February s first round election  but at the time did not think Ms  Lightfoot had much of a chance of winning  Ms  Pareenja said she was surprised and excited when the runoff field was set The fact Ms  Lightfoot had never served in elective office also helped her earn the vote of Michelle Saulnier  29  a Ph D  student  It s a good thing  especially in Chicago where there s known to be a lot of corruption   Ms  Saulnier said on Tuesday after casting her ballot in the Logan Square neighborhood  where Ms  Lightfoot lives and her campaign signs were all around   I think that s really important to try to break some of these cycles that we re in   Read more about the Chicago election for mayor that resulted in a win for Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to run the city  Don Rose  a political consultant who was a senior adviser to the Lightfoot campaign  said that Ms  Lightfoot benefited from recent corruption scandals that seemed to work against any mayoral candidate who was already part of the Chicago political establishment  It was the perfect situation for some kind of outsider who would capture that mantle and consolidate the reform minded vote   he said   People got fed up  Ms  Lightfoot  56  who held city government jobs under two mayors  presented herself on the campaign trail as an antidote to Mr  Emanuel s eight years in office and as an answer to the city s far longer tradition of machine politics  She criticized Mr  Emanuel s decision to close dozens of schools  mainly in Hispanic and black neighborhoods  and focused especially on promises to overhaul the Chicago Police Department and reduce gun violence  People feel like the violence is out of control and that there s no plan   Ms  Lightfoot said in an interview last year Just a few years ago  Mr  Emanuel turned to Ms  Lightfoot during the biggest crisis of his tenure  A Chicago police officer  Jason Van Dyke  had just been charged with murder in the death of a black teenager  Laquan McDonald  and protesters were calling for Mr  Emanuel s ouster ImageMs  Lightfoot with her daughter Vivian Lightfoot and wife Amy Eshleman before taking the stage to make her victory speech on Tuesday night CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York TimesIn the months that followed  Ms  Lightfoot was chairwoman of a panel that met with residents and produced a scathing report  The document accused the Police Department of systemic racism and found that officers had lost the trust of residents and failed to instill a sense of safety  What we heard from people all across the city is they felt like they didn t even have a claim to the geography in front of their house  on their street  or in their neighborhoods   Ms  Lightfoot said when the report was released in spring 2016 After the report was made public  Ms  Lightfoot drifted away from Mr  Emanuel  eventually resigning her role as president of the Chicago Police Board  which oversees officer discipline  and entering the mayoral race in May At the time  Ms  Lightfoot was one of only a handful of figures willing to run against Mr  Emanuel  who was widely expected to appear on the ballot until announcing in September that he would not  As the field of candidates grew more vast  including the entrance of Ms  Preckwinkle  Ms  Lightfoot forged ahead with her campaign There were reasons for skepticism  Ms  Lightfoot was relatively unknown in the city s political realm  and her ballot petition signatures were briefly challenged last year  But she surged in at least one poll in the final days before the February election  and was endorsed by The Chicago Sun Times  She has the vision  values  qualifications and policies to be an effective leader for the whole city  from the hedge fund managers to the fast food workers   the newspaper s editorial board wrote   She is calm  focused  principled and independent  In the weeks since  as the race took on a venomous tone  Ms  Lightfoot tallied up endorsements across the city  including from several of her former opponents Ms  Lightfoot repeatedly portrayed Ms  Preckwinkle  with whom she agrees on most major policy issues  as a part of the Democratic machine that long dominated Chicago government Ms  Preckwinkle was fond of noting Ms  Lightfoot s work as a  corporate lawyer  and her service in city government under the previous two mayors  And Bridget Gainer  a county commissioner who supported Ms  Preckwinkle  said her candidate s political experience was in fact an asset  We need results  not just rhetoric   Ms  Gainer said in February   Chicago is not a training wheels job   

TEL AVIV   An Israeli watchdog group has found a network of hundreds of social media accounts  many of them fake  used to smear opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in next week s election and to amplify the messages of his Likud party  according to a report to be released Monday The messages posted on the network s Twitter and Facebook accounts are frequently reposted by prominent Likud campaign officials and by the prime minister s son  Yair Netanyahu  the report says The watchdog group  the Big Bots Project  an independent organization that aims to expose the malicious use of social media  found no direct links between the network and Mr  Netanyahu  his party or his son  but said it appeared to operate in coordination with the party and Mr  Netanyahu s re election campaign  The network operates through manipulations  slander  lies and spreading rumors   the report said   On its busiest days  the network sends out thousands of tweets a day  The network s activity has intensified almost fivefold since the election was called in December  the report said  and  is mobilized at climactic moments for Netanyahu  such as the announcement of the indictment against him  The report says the network may violate Israeli laws pertaining to elections  campaign finance  privacy and taxation A spokesman for the Likud party said that it did not run a network of fake accounts   All of the Likud s digital activity is entirely authentic and is based on the great support of the citizens of Israel for Prime Minister Netanyahu and the great achievements of the Likud   the spokesman  Jonathan Urich  said on Sunday Mr  Netanyahu  who is facing an indictment on corruption charges  is in a tight race for what he hopes will be his fourth consecutive term  He is facing a strong challenge from Benny Gantz  a retired army chief  in the April 9 election According to the report  154 of the accounts in the network use fake names and another 400 accounts are suspected of being fake  The accounts appear to be operated by people  not bots  making them much harder to detect  the report says  Their posts  all in Hebrew  have had over 2 5 million hits  the report s authors estimate  in a country with 8 7 million citizens ImageBenny Gantz at a campaign rally in Tel Aviv CreditAbir Sultan EPA  via ShutterstockThe report was written by Noam Rotem and Yuval Adam  founders of the Big Bots Project  They were assisted by the Israeli Alliance  a liberal leaning organization  and their investigation was financed through an Israeli online crowdfunding site  Drove The New York Times and the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot received advance copies of the report One of the accounts is under the name  Moshe   whose handsome profile picture actually belongs to the Greek model Theo Theodoridis  Moshe  whose posts praise Mr  Netanyahu and excoriate his rivals  tweeted only 16 times during the first three months of 2018  By contrast  during the first three months of this year  with the election campaign underway  he tweeted 2 856 times The members of the network work in sync with each other  the report says  When one posted the false rumor that Mr  Gantz was a rapist  many of the others reposted it  On Thursday  many of the members almost simultaneously began tweeting that Mr  Gantz was mentally ill  echoing a video clip distributed by the Likud campaign As Mr  Gantz became Mr  Netanyahu s chief rival  the network focused more on him  The network s activity has often spiked at times of key political events The evening before the attorney general announced his decision to indict Mr  Netanyahu  the network circulated a Facebook post by an American woman saying that Mr  Gantz had sexually harassed her when they were in high school Mr  Gantz denied the accusation  and no support for it has been forthcoming  but the fabricated accounts pushed the story with tweets like   Gantz the rapist to jail  and  Lousy scum rapist  Items posted by the network have also described Mr  Gantz  somewhat incongruously  as being gay and having a mistress The network has also attacked the attorney general  Avichai Mandelblit  echoing Mr  Netanyahu s assertion that by seeking to indict the prime minister the attorney general had  surrendered to the media and the left  All accounts in the network are linked to that of a real person  Yitzhak Haddad  a resident of Ashdod The report cites a YouTube channel to which Mr  Haddad is an active subscriber  which has a message offering workers cash in exchange for  responding on Facebook and on the internet with political messages  ImageThe fake social media network s messages have been redistributed by prominent figures like Yair Netanyahu  shown here with his father CreditThomas Coex Agence France Presse   Getty Images You just get political messages and you post them   the message said It was not clear if the message was linked to the fake social network or whether Mr  Haddad ran the network When asked about the network on Sunday  Mr  Haddad said it was  all lies  He declined to confirm or deny that he was the person behind the Twitter account bearing his picture and email address  his connections with Likud  or his relationship to the YouTube channel recruiting workers for the election campaign In a later text message  Mr  Haddad wrote   There is absolutely nothing in this  Anyone publishing this nonsense can expect a very large lawsuit   You have no right to gag people on the right or on the left  period   he added   and the organization that is busy identifying accounts  who are they at all to decide for the open and free world  Mr  Urich  the Likud party spokesman  said that he did not know Mr  Haddad  and that Mr  Haddad was not employed by the Likud party

Some of the tweets that include curse words and anti Arab slurs are written using numbers that look like letters in the Hebrew alphabet  apparently so that a Twitter audit would not identify them as

former Supreme Court chief justice  Dorit Beinisch  an amendment to the law was proposed to cover social media The Likud party opposed the amendment and it did not pass Karine Nahon  president of the Israel Internet Association  who was a member of the Beinish panel  said   We made a great effort to submit the recommendations as soon as possible so that legislation could already be enacted in the coming elections  But when a first reading bill was about to be voted on  the Likud decided in the middle of the night to remove it from the agenda   

Representative Ben Ray Lujn of New Mexico  a trusted ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was seen as a possible candidate to replace her when she retired  announced on Monday that he would run for the Senate in 2020 He will seek the seat held by Senator Tom Udall  also a Democrat  who said last week that he would retire at the end of his term Mr  Lujn s decision makes him the latest aspiring House speaker to move on because of Ms  Pelosi s longevity  Chris Van Hollen  now a senator from Maryland  and Xavier Becerra  now attorney general of California  are also among the former Democratic House stars who have since sought other offices An easygoing  well liked member of the House who currently serves as deputy speaker  Mr  Lujn has represented New Mexico s Third Congressional District since 2008  He also led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  the party s arm that supports House candidates  in the 2016 and 2018 elections  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 election  Mr  Lujn tipped his cap to Mr  Udall in a statement on Monday  calling him  a champion for New Mexico  and arguing that  New Mexico needs another champion  in the Senate He pointed to his legislative record on issues like health care and the environment  while promising to uphold what he called  New Mexico values   I was born and raised in New Mexico  on the small Namb farm I still call home   Mr  Lujn said in the statement and in a video on social media   My mother retired after 33 years with the local public school district and my late father   a union ironworker and state representative   instilled in me the importance of hard work  the idea that no job is too big or too small  and a love for New Mexico that guides me every day  In a telephone interview on Monday  Mr  Lujn said that leaving the House was one of several  tough decisions  he had to make in deciding to run for the Senate  But he said he was hopeful that Democrats could flip the Senate in 2020  and  we can t do that unless we keep New Mexico blue  He enters the race at a time when New Mexico has evolved into a safely Democratic state  After voting for George W  Bush in 2004  the state has turned progressively bluer and currently has no Republicans in its congressional delegation Mr  Udall won his Senate seat in 2008 after the retirement of Senator Pete V  Domenici  the last Republican to represent New Mexico in the chamber  In that same election  Mr  Lujn captured Mr  Udall s old House district  Mr  Udall is the scion of a political dynasty in the West  Democrats are likely to have an advantage in the race for Mr  Udall s Senate seat  and Mr  Lujn  46  is just one of several lawmakers who could seek it  New Mexico was among the states that saw a tide of young and diverse Democrats sweep to power during last year s midterm elections  and some of those newly elected officials may now consider running The state elected a Latina chief executive  Gov  Michelle Lujan Grisham  and sent two new women to the House  Representative Deb Haaland  58  who became one of the first Native American women elected to Congress  and Representative Xochitl Torres Small  34  a former aide to Mr  Udall who carried a conservative leaning district that hugs the border  We re a small family and we have to work closely with one another   Mr  Lujn said of the congressional delegation from New Mexico  But he added later   I would not have jumped into this race unless I felt I was the strongest candidate  There are also a handful of prominent Republicans in the state  including Susana Martinez  the former governor  and Richard J  Berry  the former mayor of Albuquerque  It is unclear if any would be interested in mounting a long shot campaign  and Ms  Martinez left office deeply unpopular Mr  Udall offered no hint as to a preferred heir when he announced he would retire  but he has indicated that he intends to remain involved in politics and government  

CHICAGO   Chicago became the largest American city ever to elect a black woman as its mayor as voters on Tuesday chose Lori Lightfoot  a former prosecutor  to replace Rahm Emanuel  When she takes office in May  Ms  Lightfoot also will be the city s first openly gay mayor Ms  Lightfoot  who has never held elective office  easily won the race  overwhelming a better known  longtime politician and turning her outsider status into an asset in a city with a history of corruption and insider dealings  Ms  Lightfoot  56  beat Toni Preckwinkle  a former alderman who is president of the Cook County Board and who had for years been viewed as a highly formidable candidate for mayor  Here s what you need to know about Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago and the first openly gay mayor for the city  For Chicago  Ms  Lightfoot s win signaled a notable shift in the mood of voters and a rejection of an entrenched political culture that has more often rewarded insiders and dismissed unknowns  For many voters  the notion that someone with no political ties might become mayor of Chicago seemed an eye opening counterpoint to a decades old  often repeated mantra about this city s political order   We don t want nobody nobody sent  As Ms  Lightfoot took the stage in a downtown ballroom on Tuesday night  she acknowledged the unlikeliness of her resounding victory  in which she appeared to win all 50 of Chicago s wards   We were up against powerful interests  a powerful machine and a powerful mayor   she said   Nobody gave us much of a chance  For some of Ms  Lightfoot s supporters  the significance of her victory was monumental  going beyond a single candidate or city   Look  nothing personal  but it s not the good old boys club anymore

Chicagoans feel about it  National advocates for gay rights celebrated Ms  Lightfoot s win   Now young queer women and women of color can see themselves reflected in a position of major political leadership   said Stephanie Sandberg  executive director of LPAC  an organization that works to build the political power of L G B T Q  women Ms  Lightfoot s rise was unexpected only weeks ago  when 13 other candidates were vying to run the nation s third largest city  many of them far better known   with decades of experience in Chicago politics and with dynastic names like Daley  Ms  Lightfoot is a lawyer who has served in appointed positions  including as head of the Chicago Police Board and as a leader of a task force that issued a scathing report on relations between the Chicago police and black residents  but she was not widely known around the city until recent months Ms  Lightfoot   Chicago s 56th mayor   arrives at a pivotal moment for a Democratic city that has for the past eight years been led by Mr  Emanuel  who surprised many residents when he chose not to seek re election Chicago  a city of 2 7 million residents  is wrestling with dueling realities  Tech jobs and convention business have poured into its shimmering downtown while public schools have been shuttered on the South and West Sides  and thousands of black residents have moved away  Mr  Emanuel s administration made strides to shore up the city s fiscal woes but residents have complained about mounting taxes and fees  Chicago s new mayor still must come up with an additional  1 billion in the next four years to continue pulling the city out of a pension crisis And the city says its crime problems have been improving over the past two years  recording about half as many murders this year as it did during the same period in 2016  Still  gun and gang violence are pervasive and the city had more than 550 homicides in 2018  more than in the nation s two larger cities  New York and Los Angeles ImageAbraham Lacy and his son Isaac took a selfie with Chicago mayoral candidate Toni Preckwinkle on Tuesday CreditJoshua Lott ReutersRace has often played an outsize role in politics in Chicago  which is essentially evenly split between white  black and Latino residents  On Tuesday  though  the contest between two African American women scrambled the usual political calculus  or what one Chicagoan  Ra Joy  described as its habit of  tribal voting   in which politicians count on support from voters of their own race In February  during the most crowded mayoral primary in city history  Ms  Lightfoot and Ms  Preckwinkle topped a far larger array of candidates of various ethnicities  races and genders  removing all the others from Tuesday s runoff  That left political alignments few Chicagoans had seen before  Ms  Lightfoot pursuing white voters on the city s Northwest and Southwest Sides  both women seeking black voters from a base on the South Side that had leaned toward a different black candidate in February  parts of Chicago s North Side lakefront loaded with signs for Ms  Lightfoot Some residents said the history making nature of the election was energizing while others seemed nonchalant  perhaps partly because Chicago has seen similar milestones  In 1983  the city picked its first black mayor  Harold Washington  in a racially charged election  a term before that  in 1979  the city chose its first female mayor  Jane Byrne  It s not as shocking as it was back then  so that s wonderful progress   Kathy Byrne  the daughter of Jane Byrne  who died in 2014  said of the historic nature of this year s election   Why it s taken so long  I don t know  In many ways  the election transformed into a referendum on Chicago s political culture  known for its miserable ranking on most measures of corruption  its political machine and its habit of keeping family dynasties in power Ms  Lightfoot  who was partner at a prominent law firm  Mayer Brown  portrayed her newcomer status as a sign of strength  pledging to dismantle City Hall s old political ways and to  bring in the light   Still  her claim of being an outsider was questioned by some younger activists in the city  who pointed to her jobs in the Richard M  Daley administration and as a police oversight official during Mr  Emanuel s tenure  not to mention her role as a prosecutor ImageFor many of her supporters  Ms  Lightfoot s victory signaled a rejection of an entrenched political culture that has more often rewarded insiders and dismissed unknowns CreditJoshua Lott ReutersMs  Preckwinkle  the longtime Cook County board president  had tried to cast her experience as essential for managing a city the size of Chicago  while simultaneously reminding voters that she had   when she was first elected as an alderman years ago   regularly bucked the political establishment But as the election season played out  impatience over political corruption seemed to intensify among voters  in part because a major corruption scandal was unfolding at City Hall  Federal authorities have accused the City Council s longest serving alderman  Ed Burke  of running an old school shakedown  even as the local news media reported that a second alderman had cooperated with the authorities  secretly recording his conversations at City Hall for months Of the city s 50 aldermen  15 seats were up for runoff elections on Tuesday  Mr  Burke  who has denied any wrongdoing  won re election to another term in February  winning a margin large enough to avoid a runoff Rarely does this city get new  unexpected mayors  So Chicagoans watched with curiosity and uncertainty about what a Lightfoot administration would truly look like  Ms  Lightfoot has portrayed herself as a progressive  who promised to usher in a new era of accountability and transparency at City Hall  At times  she seemed to be running against Chicago politics in the public imagination  A television ad used an image of a smoke filled room and spoke darkly of the  Chicago machine  Ms  Lightfoot has spoken frequently of equity and inclusion  of redistributing city funds to spread the prosperity of downtown and the North Side to neighborhoods that have been neglected  It s unacceptable  the condition of our communities on the South and West Sides   she said during the campaign   The only way we are going to carve a new path for the city  to take us in a direction that our communities don t continue to be resource starved  is to vote for change  ImageMs  Lightfoot greeted residents on the South Side on

board  She has vowed to significantly change the Chicago Police Department  increasing training and reducing officer misconduct But her answers to the urgent question of how the city will pay its staggering bills have not been comprehensive Ms  Lightfoot has said that she will help the city meet its financial commitments by legalizing recreational marijuana and building a casino in Chicago  But she has not explained fully how she would solve the city s imminent pension crisis  Whoever is elected as mayor is going to face a very difficult financial situation   said Laurence Msall  the president of the Civic Federation  a watchdog group For Abraham Lacy  33  a Chicagoan who voted for Ms  Lightfoot s opponent on the South Side on Tuesday  the city s urgent challenges of finances  schools and crime called for someone with deep experience  It s tough to have someone new come in when you have this many things going on   Mr  Lacy said In the end  though  many voters said they were driven more by their perceptions about politics than about policy  Ms  Lightfoot  her supporters said  offered the promise of a new order and a rejection of the politics of a generation ago  It s because of Chicago   Deepti Pareenja  37  said  after casting her ballot on the city s Northwest Side for Ms  Lightfoot   We have a history of corruption with people who ve been ingrained in politics for multiple decades   

The future success of the Democratic Party depends on the crucial   but unsettled   allegiance of the nation s growing Hispanic electorate Fernand Amandi  a Democratic pollster and podcast host based in Miami  addressed the party s Latino quandary in a December interview with The Associated Press The question is not are Democrats winning the Hispanic vote   it s why aren t Democrats winning the Hispanic vote 80 20 or 90 10 the way they are winning black voters In an interview earlier this week  Amandi told me that Democrats  want and hope for this magical osmosis to happen but that s not how politics works  In the 2018 midterms  Democrats showed gains among Hispanic voters in most states  compared with 2014  Party operatives are concerned  however  about the slow rate of growth of these improved Democratic margins  They are equally worried about turnout   at a time when many thought that President Trump s rhetoric and policies would produce impressive gains among Latino voters for the Democratic Party Take turnout  Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic constituencies in the United States  but their level of political participation is not keeping pace with their overall population numbers As the accompanying Pew chart demonstrates  the number of Hispanic voters in midterm elections has grown steadily  from 2 9 million in 1986 to 6 8 million in 2014  At the same time  however  turnout   measured as a percentage of total eligible adult citizens 18 and over   has experienced a relative decline The Growth of the Latino Bloc       g edsall1 box  g artboard

  02           06           10           14         By The New York Times   Source  Pew Research CenterIn 1986  the Latino turnout rate was 38 7 percent  in 2014  that rate fell to 27 1 percent  If the 2014 turnout rate had been as high as it was in 1986  Hispanics would have cast 9 7 million ballots instead of 6 8 million   Complete numbers for 2018 are still being compiled  In a preliminary analysis of Hispanic voter turnout last year  Catalist  a Democratic firm that builds voter lists  found significant increases in turnout of three to five percent  comparing 2018 with the 2014 midterms  Texas  Nevada and California saw five percent increases  Florida four percent  New Mexico and New York three percent Turnout rates and levels of support are two key  but quite different  political measures  While Latinos had a turnout rate of 27 1 percent in 2014  their support for Democratic House candidates that year was 62 percent  Their support for Republican House candidates was 36 percent  according to exit polls While Democratic support among Hispanics has improved over the past decade  from the low 60s to the high 60s  there is evidence suggesting that those gains cannot be relied upon in future elections In the midterm elections  Florida became the prime example of such unreliability  as Republicans demonstrated they could buck state and national trends to make substantial gains among Hispanics Republicans won two close statewide races in Florida in 2018  one for senate and one for governor   despite the gradual erosion of Republican support among Cuban Americans in the state and despite the continuing influx of pro Democratic Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017 Simon Rosenberg  president of NDN  formerly the New Democrat Network  a pro Democratic think tank  wrote   In All Important Florida  Democrats Lose Ground With Hispanic Voters  a month after the 2018 election In an election where Democrats had one of their best years ever with Hispanic voters across the country  Florida Democrats saw their Hispanic numbers decline  Nationally  Democrats went from 62 36  26 pts  in 2014 to 69 29  40 pts  this election  In Florida  Democrats went from 58 38  20 pts  in 2014 to 54 44  10 pts  this year As Rosenberg pointed out  this shift occurred despite the fact that Trump did everything possible to alienate Latinos  along with undercutting Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis  the winning Republican candidates for Senate and governor Rosenberg noted that Trump hadrelentlessly attacked immigrants and Hispanics in particular  He grossly mismanaged the aftermath of Hurricane Maria  sending hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans fleeing to Central Florida  He revoked the temporary status of many immigrants in Florida  Given all this  one would have imagined the environment for Democrats to make gains among Hispanics was present in Florida this year  gains which were made elsewhere  Yet we fell back By all accounts  Scott and DeSantis campaigned almost daily in Hispanic precincts  while their Democratic opponents  Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum  took the Hispanic vote for granted  We had no infrastructure   Christian Ulvert  Gillum s director for Spanish language media  told Politico And honestly  Democrats have been playing catch up on Hispanic outreach for two decades  because Republicans have invested in it  You can t close that gap overnight Politico described Nelson s bid for a fourth term as  a uniquely lazy campaign that made laughably ineffectual attempts to engage with Hispanics  Melissa Michelson  a political scientist at Menlo College in California and president of the Latino caucus of the American Political Science Association  described in an email the changing political orientation of Florida s Cuban Americans In a 1989 90 survey  Michelson wrote  68 8 percent of Cuban Americans identified with Republicans  Since then there have been significant changes  Over the years  she continued  Pew has documented a steady decline in Cuban Americans  Republican identification  from 64 percent in 2002 to 56 percent in 2006 to 47 percent in 2013 Despite the decline in Republican support among Cuban Americans  Michelson emphasized thatThere has always been a contingent of Latinos who identify as Republican and are more interested in Republican conservative  or anti Communist  policies than in immigration issues or racism  Recall that 40 percent of Latinos voted for Bush in 2004  Reagan also enjoyed considerable Latino support  I think many Democrats are continually perplexed by this   that there could be Latino voters who are willing to support a president  or candidate  like Trump whose rhetoric and policies are so clearly anti Latino and racist While Scott and DeSantis revived Cuban American willingness to support Republicans  two of the three Florida House seats that had been represented by Cuban American Republicans switched parties in 2018 Revealing a contrast to Florida  Matt A  Barreto  a political scientist at U C L A  and a co founder of Latino Decisions  analyzed turnout and voting patterns in Texas  In a March report  Barreto described a huge pro Democratic turnout increase there  ranging from 105 to 125 percent in eight counties where Hispanics make up more than 90 percent of the population  There were significant gains in counties with white majorities of 83 to 91 percent too  but these upturns were smaller  in the 35 to 55 percent range The ability of two conservative Florida Republicans to make such inroads simply by campaigning diligently suggests that the Democratic hold on Latinos is less firm than many believed So where do Latinos stand politically The NBC News Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 918 Hispanics during 2018 and found that Trump s job approval rating was a relatively dismal 30 percent  21 points below his 51 percent favorability rating among whites  but 18 points higher than his 12 percent approval rate among African Americans The data  provided to The Times by Public Opinion Strategies  one of the two firms that conducted the survey  found that Trump s approval among Hispanics was highest among men and among the affluent   40 percent for both   and among men without college degrees  at 39 percent A 2018 Pew report   Key takeaways about Latino voters in the 2018 midterm elections   found that Hispanics cast a decisive majority of votes for Democratic congressional candidates  69 29   a smaller percentage of votes  however  than African Americans  90 9  and Asian Americans  77 23   Whites backed Republicans  54 to 44 In a state by state breakdown  Pew found that in the Texas Senate race  Latinos backed Democrat Beto O Rourke over Ted Cruz by nearly two to one  64 35  while Greg Abbott  the incumbent Republican governor  lost the Hispanic vote to Democratic challenger Lupe Valdez  53 42 In Florida  Democrats Gillum and Nelson won the Hispanic vote by nearly equal percentages  54 44 and 54 45    but in both cases by margins that were inadequate to produce overall victory The Democratic winner in the Nevada Senate race  Jacky Rosen  did far better among Hispanics  who backed her over Dean Heller  the Republican incumbent  67 30 While many Democrats expected Trump s anti immigrant rhetoric and policies  especially the family separation debacle  to produce a decisive shift to the left among Hispanics  that has not proved to be the case An October 2018 Pew report found that almosthalf of Latinos  48 percent  believe there is about the right amount of immigrants living in the U S   while a quarter say there are too many immigrants and 14 percent say there are too few  Three quarters of Hispanics opposed Trump s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border  while one in five favors construction In an email  Barreto  of Latino Decisions  argued that Democratic support among Hispanics remains solid I do not see anything since November 2018 to suggest Dems are losing any support at all  Trump continues on the same path of bashing immigrants and bashing Latinos without evidence and this only further decreases his favorability among Latinos Asked about the declining share of eligible Hispanics turning out on Election Day  Barreto countered that the growing numbers of eligible Latinos arealmost entirely driven by U S  born young Latinos turning 18 and entering the eligible voter pool In a common pattern  Barreto pointed out   young people have very low rates of voter registration and voter turnout   especially in midterm elections  Because of that  Barreto said that in order to get a better picture  the data should be age adjusted so that turnout levels of older voters of different races and ethnicities could be compared Barreto is also sharply critical of most polling of Hispanics and of exit polls in particular  arguing that the lack of Spanish speaking interviewers results in an undercount of Hispanic turnout as well as inaccurate estimates of Republican and Democratic votes In addition  candidates and political parties have to make a much stronger case to young Hispanics that their vote matters  according to Barreto Otherwise  you will only get incremental growth each year   which still puts Latinos as a larger and larger share of the electorate  but perhaps not as large as we could be Rosenberg  of NDN  argues that the Democratic Party did not start targeting the Hispanic electorate  with modern campaign tactics and communications  until the 2006 8 period  Those efforts immediately bore fruit  Rosenberg contended in an email Remember that in 2004 Bush won Arizona  Colorado  New Mexico and Nevada  Now Colorado and New Mexico are no longer really competitive at the presidential level  Nevada is slipping away from the Republicans  and Democrats elected a Senator in 2018 in Arizona Texas  according to Rosenberg   is about to hit a tipping point   in large part because of the Hispanic vote What conclusions and what questions remain in the wake of these complex and sometimes conflicting trends in the Hispanic electorate First and foremost  Latinos remain a decisively Democratic constituency  with important caveats Brian Schaffner  a political scientist at Tufts and co principal researcher at the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  wrote in an email that nationally  Hispanic support for Democrats has been relatively consistent Schaffner provided the accompanying graph  which shows the level of voting for Democrats in House contests in the six elections from 2008 to 2018 for whites  blacks  Asian Americans and Hispanics  The Hispanic Democratic vote shows a significant 8 6 point increase from 2014 to 2016 and a 13 6 point increase from 2014 to 2018   call it the Trump jump   although the increase in the percentage of Asian Americans voting for Democrats was even larger at 20 2 points Who Votes for DemocratsOf votes for the two major party candidates in House races  the share that went

Source  analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election Study by Brian Schaffner  Tufts UniversityLatinos  partisan loyalties are much less hard and fast than  say  those of either African Americans or white evangelicals  The results in Florida demonstrate that Democrats risk defeat if they fail to campaign heavily in Hispanic communities  and Republicans stand to gain at the margins if they are prepared to invest time  money and energy The major question mark going into 2020  assuming Trump is the Republican nominee  is whether Hispanic opposition to his presidency will prevent a recurrence of the Florida 2018 phenomenon  Will Trump s presence so nationalize the election that down ballot Republicans will face a brick wall when they try to make modest inroads among Hispanics To date  Trump has shown every intention of turning the election into a referendum on himself  and all the baggage he carries  with no regard for the political survival of fellow Republicans  If anything  he appears determined to drive up hostility to him among Latinos  For the past two days  for example  the president has ranted on Twitter  attacking Puerto Rico and its political leaders On Monday  he told his Twitter followers Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works On Tuesday  he was still at it All their local politicians do is complain   ask for more money  The pols are grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA Behaving this way  Trump may succeed in driving up support among  his people   as he likes to call his voters  But if he keeps it up  he will be doing both his Democratic opponent and the Democratic Party as a whole a huge favor as far as the Latino vote goes The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s

RALEIGH  N C    When Republicans took control of virtually every lever of North Carolina s state government for the first time since Reconstruction  they set out to transform the historically moderate Southern state into a more conservative stronghold That was less than seven years ago These days  the question is how much Republicans may have set their project back with a recent string of remarkable self inflicted wounds  It s never a dull moment with the Republicans here   said Morgan Jackson  a Democratic strategist and an ally of Gov  Roy Cooper  the Democrat whose November 2016 election was helped along by the protracted fight over a Republican backed bill limiting the bathroom choices of transgender people   Every time we think it can t get worse  they figure out a way to dig deeper  This week  federal prosecutors announced that the chairman of the state s Republican Party  Robin Hayes  had been indicted on charges of bribery and other crimes related to a scheme they said was designed to aid a major donor  who was also charged  The revelation came almost six weeks after Republicans faced the rare embarrassment of watching their seeming victory in a congressional race unravel after it became clear that their nominee had financed an illicit voter turnout effort  Read  Inside a Fly by Night Operation to Harvest Ballots in North Carolina For the state s Republicans  who rose to power by railing against cases of Democratic corruption and promising to be a positive disrupting force  the fresh scandals amount to a staggering record of self disruption For the state s liberals  it has been a moment to bask in schadenfreude  Over the last several years  they watched and warred with North Carolina Republicans amid aggressive conservative efforts to deregulate industry  play down climate change  curtail access to the ballot box  strip a Democratic governor of some executive powers  launch their so called  bathroom bill  and gerrymander districts in ways that made the courts recoil Republicans won some of those fights and lost others  but the hard right turn plunged the state into years of intense partisan warfare rife with high profile boycotts and large scale public demonstrations It is this record  and the recent bouts with scandal  that could also affect state and national elections next year Mr  Cooper will be up for re election  as will Senator Thom Tillis  a Republican whose delicate political situation was recently underscored by his opposition to   then eventual support of   President Trump s controversial executive action to fund a border wall And once again  this battleground state will be up for grabs in a presidential race   one that will unfold as Charlotte  the state s largest city  hosts the Republican National Convention  where Mr  Trump is likely to make his case for re election But there is also a chance that Democrats might end up ensnared in the most recent federal probe The donor who was charged  Greg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham  gave money to both parties  In the indictment unsealed Tuesday  federal prosecutors said Mr  Lindberg worked with Mr  Hayes to bribe the state insurance commissioner  Mike Causey  with campaign donations in the hopes that Mr  Causey would replace a state regulator who oversaw a company that Mr  Lindberg owned Mr  Hayes  who is a former congressman  Mr  Lindberg and two other men who were charged pleaded not guilty on Tuesday in appearances before a federal magistrate in Charlotte Mr  Causey  a Republican  tipped off federal investigators about possible corruption and later worked closely with them during their protracted inquiry  In an interview on Wednesday  Mr  Causey said he did not expect Republicans to be alone in facing the fallout  This is certainly not a party thing   Mr  Causey said  adding   I think when the facts come out  you re going to see both parties in the same boat  ImageGreg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham  has been accused of working with Mr  Hayes to bribe the state insurance commissioner CreditRobert Brown Public Relations  via Associated PressMr  Causey would not elaborate  and a spokeswoman for the F B I  declined to comment Although the indictment focused on Mr  Lindberg s dealings with Republicans  his ties to Democrats have also been under scrutiny in recent months Wayne Goodwin  a former insurance commissioner who is now chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party  accepted donations from Mr  Lindberg and later consulted for him  Mr  Goodwin told The Wall Street Journal this year that he was not a target of the federal inquiry  with which he said he cooperated The speculation around Mr  Goodwin  who has not been charged  did not keep his state party operation from taking a gleeful swing at its opponent  In a statement  Democrats mashed the scandals together and also nodded to the turmoil surrounding Representative Mark Walker  a North Carolina Republican whose ties to Mr  Lindberg were referenced in the indictment that became public this week   Mr  Walker was not charged with a crime and was not identified by name in the indictment   Bribery  Election fraud  Witness tampering  Lying to the F B I    Wednesday s Democratic Party statement declared  adding that 2019 would be the year when  North Carolina Republicans  corruption finally became public  and the party s leading figures  became fully engulfed in chaos  Carter Wrenn  a longtime Republican consultant in North Carolina  said the allegations of chicanery created  a smell in the air and around the Republican Party   The party  he said  would do well to try to quickly isolate the scandals Indeed  the Republican Party played down the idea of chaos  even as it moved to put a limited distance between itself and the accused  In a statement on Wednesday  it said Mr  Hayes had  relinquished most of his day to day duties  and that another Republican leader  Aubrey Woodard  had been named acting chairman  On Monday  the day before his indictment became public  Mr  Hayes said he planned to step down later this year as party chairman  citing his health The indictment is a dramatic turn of events for Mr  Hayes  73  a former State House majority whip whose family founded the Cannon Mills textiles company  and who has long been an advocate of integrating biblical principles into state government  He opposes abortion and was criticized  in an unsuccessful 1996 run for governor  for supporting a sex education curriculum that promoted abstinence and recommended cleaning genitals with Lysol disinfectant after sex To critics  the new instability is a consequence of the party s years of dominance  when they controlled the Executive Mansion and had a supermajority in the General Assembly  Until this year there s been literally no check on these folks  except for the courts   said Allison Riggs  a senior lawyer at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice who has been involved in fighting Republican redistricting efforts in North Carolina Pat McCrory  a business minded former Charlotte mayor  was elected governor in 2012 and helped cement Republican power in North Carolina  But the party s state legislative leaders often set the aggressive tone  In March 2016  Republicans led the charge on the law that became known as H B  2  which curbed legal protections for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people and set new restrictions on transgender bathroom use The resulting national backlash  with boycotts and threats of boycotts  allowed Mr  Cooper  who was then challenging Mr  McCrory  to argue that Republicans were harming the business climate  In November 2016  on a night when Mr  Trump won the state  Mr  Cooper did  too  by a slim margin  A few months later  he and the Legislature arrived at a compromise to repeal the law Last year  the Republicans  power was further weakened when they lost their veto proof majorities in the Legislature But they are majorities still  proof of the continued power of conservative ideas in North Carolina In an interview in his office on Wednesday  Senator Phil Berger  the president pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate and long one of the most influential Republicans in the state  cautioned against drawing immediate conclusions about how the scandals would influence voters Still  he acknowledged that it was  frustrating  that scandals were so often overshadowing Republican policy achievements  Stepping on a rake   Mr  Berger said with a light chuckle   I see it as some Republicans doing something that creates problems for the vast majority of Republicans who haven t done anything wrong   

RAMALLAH  West Bank   Israel is holding an election on Tuesday  and Palestinian communities in the occupied territories are not following it with much interest  This is not because whoever is elected will not have a strong impact on our lives  It s because none of the leading candidates has a program for peace  The main contenders are committed to maintaining the illegal Jewish settlements that have been established in the West Bank  They do not seek to end the occupation  Israel has not formally annexed the West Bank or the Gaza Strip  but it lords over these lands like a sovereign power  Or worse  It has seized tax revenues from the Palestinian Authority  which is supposed to administer the West Bank  it keeps Gaza under siege  It dictates that we  Palestinians  can only watch from our homes the results of an election whose outcome will govern our lives and the future on our land  Israeli Jews in the West Bank are citizens  but we are not  They will be able to go into Israel to vote  Not us During the last Israeli election  in 2015  I wrote that Palestinians here had become less interested in the results of that race than in the prospect of filing various international legal cases  I  for one  had pinned my hopes on the preparation of several claims to be brought before the International Criminal Court in The Hague  One of them would challenge the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank  There was no lack of evidence  I thought  and the transfer of civilians by a government into territories it occupies is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 Now I think  Never mind the merits of any such cases  With the United States government threatening to refuse granting visas to the court s staff   this  in relation to another case  to do with suspected crimes in Afghanistan   our chances are slim  Last month  the Trump administration also recognized Israel s authority over the Golan Heights  disputed territory that Israel forcibly seized from Syria in 1967  This can only embolden Israel to eventually proceed with the formal annexation of the West Bank Israel  thanks partly to this support from the United States  now appears to be winning on all fronts  with impunity  And we Palestinians seem too weak to stop it Israelis  for their part  seem to live under the illusion popularized by their prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  that their government can manage the conflict   that there is no need to actually resolve it  Yet over the span of Mr  Netanyahu s premiership  the situation has gone from gloom to more gloom  from dark times to darker ones  from some measure of hope to despair Then again  at this point  maybe even darker would be better for us   maybe that s the only way out  My one consolation watching Israel pursue its current path is to think that it is doing itself damage  too Consider three examples Violence by Jewish settlers and right wing activists against Palestinians in the West Bank more than tripled last year  compared with 2017 An Israeli family built a home on land taken away from Palestinians   and then tried to rent it out on Airbnb  When the company balked  citing a new policy announced late last year against listing properties in settlements  the family brought a case for discrimination in the United States   The Palestinian family is suing back  Last week  a family near the village of Hizma  north of Jerusalem  whose house is in an Israeli settlement  chose to destroy its home of more than three decades rather than paying Israeli authorities to do the job  and being fined  Won t Israeli society at some point also feel the nefarious effects of its government s inhumanity toward us In Arundhati Roy s novel  The Ministry of Utmost Happiness   one of her characters  Musa  says that if Kashmiris have failed to gain independence from India  at least in struggling for it they have exposed the corruption of India s system  Musa tells the book s narrator  an Indian   You re not destroying us  You are constructing us  It s yourselves that you are destroying   Palestinians today might say the same of our struggle with Israel Raja Shehadeh is a lawyer and the author of  Where the Line Is Drawn  A Tale of Crossings  Friendships and Fifty Years of Occupation in Israel Palestine  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

ANKARA  Turkey   I am a 30 year old Turkish man  and for my entire adult life there has been a ritual to elections  There s a bitterly fought campaign  the polling day arrives  people vote  ballots are counted and Recep Tayyip Erdogan wins  He stands on the balcony of his Justice and Development Party s headquarters in Ankara and gives a victory speech to a cheering crowd  If you are part of that crowd  you feel as if you have become a little more important in the world  If you aren t  you feel as if you have become a little less relevant  This sequence of events has repeated itself for 17 years  On Sunday Turkey voted to elect the mayors of its 81 provinces and their municipalities  President Erdogan s party  known as the A K P   allied itself with the ultranationalist National Movement Party  the secularist main opposition Republican People s Party  the C H P   contested in partnership with Good Party  an outfit that splintered from the nationalists in 2018  The People s Democratic Party  the H D P    which is home to Kurdish left nationalists  cooperated with the opposition alliance in several major cities while running against the A K P  in the Kurdish majority southeastern provinces  It was a brutal contest  Mr  Erdogan personally campaigned every day and repeatedly accused his opponents of being terrorist collaborators  Most opposition candidates merely presented themselves as the non Erdogan option On Sunday night  Mansur Yavas  the C H P  candidate for Ankara mayor  was comfortably ahead of his rival from the A K P   which has controlled Ankara for 25 years  Despite the momentous developments in Ankara  all eyes were fixed on Istanbul  Ekrem Imamoglu  a young  energetic C H P  candidate  was briskly tallying up votes and catching up fast with Mr  Erdogan s chosen man for Istanbul  Binali Yildirim  a former prime minister and former speaker of the Turkish Parliament Our phones were exploding with WhatsApp messages  There was a photo of Mr  Yildirim writing a short victory speech  There was Mr  Imamoglu going on air and insisting that he was leading by his campaign s calculations  People were angry because the authorities stopped publishing results as Mr  Imamoglu caught up with Mr  Yildirim in the public figures Then a news flash  Mr  Erdogan was on the balcony  But something was off  As he stepped up to the crowd  he began singing along to the song booming into the night   These roses are for you  this soul is ours  Don t be sad  don t cry  Always smile   Mr  Erdogan s speech was short and vague  He said that he was honored to carry the popular vote  and that his party had done well in many provinces  none of which he named   Those who made false claims are welcome to it   he said   let us see how they govern   This was the closest he got to admitting the calamity  His A K P  had lost Ankara and Istanbul  apart from other major cities To understand the significance of this  it helps to know the dominant narrative of Turkish politics today  It goes something like this  Throughout its republican history  Turkey has been governed by a secular elite characterized by its impish adherence to Western imperialists A group of plucky conservatives kept challenging this system until  in 1994  a young Erdogan and his friend  now dismissed  won the mayoralties of Istanbul and Ankara  respectively  Amid the economic crises  weak coalition governments and civil unrest of the 1990s  Mr  Erdogan and his associates were islands of good governance  They served these great cities with distinction and earned a reputation of incorruptibility  In 2002  their movement  now under the banner of the A K P   was elected into national office  Under Mr  Erdogan s firm leadership  they grew the economy  fixed the bureaucracy and won up to half of the popular vote  Turkey was booming  the world talked about the  Turkish model  of majority Muslim democracy  By the mid 2010s  Mr  Erdogan had defanged the coup prone military and disenfranchised the corrupt elites of old  The jealous opposition parties joined shadowy outside actors in plotting the downfall of Turkey s great revival  Some of Mr  Erdogan s friends and allies betrayed him  but  the people  did not  When the economy slowed down  or the court system got clogged up  he asked people to sacrifice for the cause of what he called  New Turkey   a nation unshackled from Western domination and free to soar to new heights But the myth of New Turkey is paradoxical  It was built on doing practical things in the 1990s  like filling potholes  But to maintain the myth  Mr  Erdogan sometimes asked voters to ignore those practical things and simply to have faith in  the cause   On Sunday  there was a major breach in this wall of faith  especially in Istanbul  where Mr  Erdogan s love of the people first transmuted into government service  This was probably due to a combination of growing economic problems and an increasingly competent opposition  It is a close count in Istanbul  and the Supreme Electoral Council has asked for three days to check everything  As things stand  it seems that Mr  Imamoglu  the young and stubbornly positive candidate of the C H P   will get the job that started Mr  Erdogan s  great love affair  with the people 25 years ago If that doesn t happen  and the A K P  holds the city  people will know that Mr  Imamoglu went up against vastly unequal odds   the government s near monopoly on TV  its abundant use of state resources  its threats of litigation   and probably still won This could signal the limits of Mr  Erdogan s political strategy  Already in this election  opposition politicians mocked the president for calling ordinary voters terrorists  He strongly denied the claim and sued one of them  In a recently viral video  an old woman asked   Why should the man governing Turkey make a distinction between the people  Are those  opposition  parties always evil and you  Erdogan  are good  When populist rhetoric comes from a fresh face and aims at a calcified elite  it sounds plausible  When it has supplanted that elite  and it has reached its demographic limits  it begins to look ridiculous  And therein lies the problem of Mr  Erdogan s politics  He isn t honest with himself  He wants to dominate the political space and transform the country  but he isn t quite willing to engage in the scale of repression that would require  He demonizes his opposition as terrorist collaborators  yet still allows them to participate in elections  Mr  Erdogan s style of politics demands that he either crank up the intensity  or collapse under the weight of its own contradictions Selim Koru is an analyst at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara and a

Nearly five years ago  Lesley McSpadden appeared distraught before the world after finding out that a grand jury had declined to indict a white police officer in Ferguson  Mo   in the fatal shooting of her teenage son  Michael Brown  who was black She stood on top of a car  surrounded by a sea of supporters   I ve been here my whole life  I ain t never had to go through nothing like this   she said before sinking her face into her hands Ms  McSpadden  39  came up short on Tuesday in an attempt to turn that sorrow and anger into an elected post  She lost the three way race for a seat on the Ferguson City Council to Fran Griffin  a black woman who has been deeply involved in reform efforts in Ferguson since the death of Mr  Brown  who was 18 Ms  McSpadden s election bid was her latest effort to effect change in the name of her son  She made appearances with other black mothers who lost their children to violence  including on stage at the Democratic National Convention in 2016  She also testified before the Missouri State Legislature  I wanted to go back and do something right in a place that did something so very wrong to my son  and I think that s what my son would want as well   Ms  McSpadden said about her candidacy in an interview with The Associated Press About a year ago  she moved from a nearby community to Ferguson s third ward  a predominantly black part of town that includes the apartment complex where her son was killed The police officer who shot him  Darren Wilson  was cleared of criminal wrongdoing on both the state and federal level but resigned from the police force ImageMs  McSpadden at her son s funeral in August 2015 CreditRichard Perry The New York TimesThe killing helped incite a national movement for police accountability  It also led to a Justice Department investigation that found that the police and municipal court system routinely violated the rights of black residents with disparities in traffic stops and the use of force  among other things That report  which came during President Barack Obama s time in office  led city leaders to reach an agreement with federal officials in which they agreed to take steps to reform the city s legal system Mr  Brown s killing also helped to change the makeup of the Ferguson City Council  which had just one black member at the time of the shooting  Now  three of the six council members are black  the mayor is white One black council member elected after Mr  Brown s killing  Wesley Bell  recently defeated the white incumbent county prosecutor who had overseen the grand jury that declined to indict Mr  Wilson Ms  Griffin  who was one of Ms  McSpadden s opponents in the election  moved to Ferguson in 2005 from her hometown  St  Louis  so that her children could have better educational opportunities  she said  She had long experienced some of the disparities that came with being black in the St  Louis suburb   she was constantly stopped by the police while driving  and many of her family members refused to visit her because of their concerns about the police  she said After Mr  Brown was killed  Ms  Griffin  38  regularly attended street protests in Ferguson  When the city reached the agreement with federal authorities  known as a consent decree  Ms  Griffin joined a committee created to help revise local policies and practices  The committee has contributed to the overhauling of policies pertaining to police searches  the use of force  and dash and body cameras  she said  I have compassion and empathy for what she went through as a mother because I don t wish that pain on anybody   Ms  Griffin said of Ms  McSpadden  But she added that the city needed a representative who  a  is aware of the issues that are going on  b  has been actively working toward creating the change  c  has a connection to the community  is accessible to the community  If Ms  McSpadden wins  she would become the second black mother who lost her son in a contentious shooting to be elected to office within the past year In Georgia  Lucy McBath won a congressional seat last year  A man fatally shot her son  Jordan Davis  in 2012 in a dispute over loud music  That man  Michael Dunn  was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison  

CHICAGO   Lori Lightfoot  a political novice  swept into Chicago s City Hall in staggering style  winning 73 percent of the vote and sending a deafening message to the political veteran she had defeated  She pronounced the results a  broad mandate for change   She promised to break the city s endless cycle of corruption  She pledged to remake Chicago  Thriving  prosperous  better  stronger  fairer   for everyone   Ms  Lightfoot said  beaming from a microphone in the hours after the votes were cast But this is Chicago  a city that is vast  complex  set in its ways and full of problems that are now Ms  Lightfoot s to solve Ms  Lightfoot  who will become this city s first black woman mayor and its first openly gay mayor when she takes office in May  made clean government a centerpiece of her agenda  But Chicago still carries the vestiges of its notorious political machine and  by some measures  more corruption than any other American city  Chicago s entrenched and decades long struggles with crime  segregation  policing and inequity loom  And its longstanding fiscal problems are urgent  Ms  Lightfoot must come up with another  1 billion to deal with a looming pension crisis  and fast  This is all hard   said David Axelrod  a longtime Chicagoan and political strategist   She s just pulled off an extraordinary political feat and that bespeaks a certain intellect and strength that is important  There are other skills that will be needed now   to cajole people  to get people to accept compromise  to recognize how much of the loaf you can have   he added   This is really a challenging job and she comes to it in not optimal times   Read more about Mayor elect Lori Lightfoot here  Uncertainty in the City CouncilWhen Harold Washington  Chicago s first black mayor  arrived at City Hall in 1983 promising change  he was greeted with a stone wall of opposition from a large group of white aldermen  What followed was a period of racially charged political fighting that came to be known as Council Wars ImageHarold Washington  right  and his fiance  Mary Smith  joined hands with State Senator Richard Newhouse as Mr  Washington declared victory in the 1983 mayoral race CreditKen Love Associated PressWhile Ms  Lightfoot is unlikely to encounter that level of organized resistance from the 50 member City Council  she will have to contend with it as a formidable governing body  theoretically powerful  thick with alliances and at least partly stocked with aldermen who supported Ms  Lightfoot s opponent in the mayoral race  Toni Preckwinkle  Historically  mayors like Ms  Lightfoot s predecessor  Rahm Emanuel  have held a firm hand over the council in setting the city s agenda  but Ms  Lightfoot s relationship with the aldermen is uncertain for now  None of them owe their elections to Lori  and so for the first time in perhaps 55 years  you may see the emergence of the kind of Chicago city government that during that time has only existed on paper   a weak mayor strong City Council government   said Marilyn Katz  a political consultant who worked on the Harold Washington campaign   What she uses to get them to vote for her proposals is unclear  David Orr  a former county clerk who served briefly as an interim Chicago mayor in the 1980s  said he thought Ms  Lightfoot s overwhelming margin of victory   she won all 50 of the city s wards   would ease her efforts to make inroads with the City Council  It s going to be a battle  O K    a battle in the sense that power never wants to give up what it s got   Mr  Orr said Ja Mal Green  an activist and former mayoral candidate who supported Ms  Lightfoot  said he believed that voters understood that Ms  Lightfoot could not instantly make all the changes she has pledged  She s not going to be able to make good on every promise   Mr  Green said   She ll be able to start the path for all the things that she promised  The City Council is not the only possible roadblock between Ms  Lightfoot and her ambitious agenda  Ms  Lightfoot  who promised in her campaign to kill what s left of the sputtering  Chicago machine   a system of patronage and corruption that once dominated city politics  will also face the challenge of working with Ms  Preckwinkle  who remains the president of the Cook County Board and will work in an office near Ms  Lightfoot Ms  Preckwinkle and Ms  Lightfoot sparred during debates this year  yet they exited the campaign on a gracious note  At the urging of the Rev  Jesse Jackson  they both appeared on Wednesday morning at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition on the city s South Side  holding hands in a gesture of unity ImageEddie Johnson  Chicago s police superintendent  Ms  Lightfoot  who made gun violence and police misconduct central to her campaign  will have to decide whether to pursue her promised changes with new leadership in the Police Department CreditRich Hein Chicago Sun Times  via Associated PressCrime  Policing and Promises of ReformAnother challenge ahead for Ms  Lightfoot  the scandal prone police department and persistently high homicide rate  both of which damaged the city s reputation and vexed Mr  Emanuel through eight years in office She will quickly be tested  After running on promises to reduce gun violence  Ms  Lightfoot will take office just before summer  the season when shootings traditionally spike  No child should have to worry about the consequences of going to the park and no parent should have to keep their kids inside on a warm day for fear of violence   Ms  Lightfoot s campaign website said Generations of Chicago mayors have struggled to tamp down violence and root out police misconduct  sometimes making progress but never ending the problems  Ms  Lightfoot  who made the issues central to her campaign  will have to decide whether to pursue her promised changes with new leadership in the Police Department or keep Superintendent Eddie Johnson in his post Ms  Lightfoot s role with law enforcement is complex  She emerged in recent years as one of the chief critics of the police  and she led a panel that found patterns of excessive force  systemic racism and strained community relations in the department  But she has a background in law enforcement  including a stint as a federal prosecutor  and has worked in police oversight roles in Chicago  including as the president of the Chicago Police Board Vague Plan for a Financial MessPerhaps most of all  Ms  Lightfoot will be tested by the city s urgent fiscal woes All four of the pension funds are miserably underfunded  Ms  Lightfoot also must dream up a plan to solve an expected budget shortfall in the coming year  That all comes as Chicagoans are increasingly frustrated over mounting taxes and increased fees   and loath to even talk about digging up any more cash for City Hall  And the possibility of worse economic times could make matters even more dire  The city and state of Illinois descended into their worst in the nation financial condition during one of the longest economic expansions in U S  history   Laurence Msall  president of the Civic Federation  a watchdog group  said   Neither government is currently prepared to weather the storm in the event of a recession  particularly if it is deep or long lasting  The fiscal challenges have developed over decades and multiple mayors  and they loom  During a combative campaign  neither Ms  Lightfoot nor her opponent laid out a comprehensive plan to solve the problem  The hard part starts now   said Eric Adelstein  a political consultant in Chicago who helped with Ms  Lightfoot s campaign   There are huge challenges facing this city  It s an exciting moment  but these jobs are rough   

MOSCOW   The email came out of the blue  from an aide to the mysterious Russian billionaire  Oleg V  Deripaska  who is said to be close to President Vladimir V  Putin and an on again  off again character in the two year investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election Would I be interested in interviewing Mr  Deripaska  the aide asked  It was a bit like being summoned to meet with Greta Garbo or J D  Salinger Of course  I said  aware that Mr  Deripaska normally communicated  if at all  through the phalanx of lawyers and publicity agents he surrounded himself with  I wondered to myself why he had suddenly decided to speak out Soon enough  I found myself sitting alone in a hotel conference room  at a table bearing a gigantic fruit platter  unsure what to expect  This was  after all  a man who had emerged on top in Russia s bloody aluminum wars in the 1990s  and was accused in United States Treasury Department documents of suspected ties to organized crime  money laundering and ordering a contract killing He is a man of about average stature  whose most striking feature is his large  round head  He was intense  and spoke in a robotic English  so as not to worry about mistranslations  he said It soon became clear that he saw the determination of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  that the Trump administration had not colluded with Russia  at least according to a Justice Department summary of his findings  as an opening to rehabilitate his image in the West This despite the fact that Mr  Deripaska had refused to cooperate with the investigation  revealing for the first time that he had received written questions from the Mueller team but had declined to answer them  Do I feel like your president  that I am exonerated   he said at one point   I never felt guilty  It was annoying for me  There was this huge crush on my business  on my companies  when sanctions were put on the companies I founded  ImageLike President Trump  Mr  Deripaska took a victory lap after the special counsel s report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesOver cups of special black tea from his home region  Krasnodar  he complained of the tendency of the American news media to rush to judgment and professed confidence in the United States justice system  which he said would ultimately prove his innocence of any wrongdoing A graduate of a prestigious physics faculty  Mr  Deripaska rose to wealth in the 1990s  strong arming his way to a virtual monopoly over the Russian aluminum industry  When it placed sanctions on him and his companies last year  the Treasury Department cited his links to the Russian government  saying he profits from the country s  malign activity around the globe  Even while keeping a low profile  he pursued a costly lobbying and legal effort to assert his innocence  Initially  this revolved around sanctions on his businesses  and with the help of a global influence buying operation he did persuade the Treasury Department to lift sanctions on his aluminum empire in January Mr  Deripaska now wants to escape the personal sanctions  which hinder his ability to do business in the United States  Last month  he filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of those sanctions  which he claims have cost him  7 5 billion The conclusion that members of the Trump campaign had not colluded with Russians  Mr  Deripaska said  suggested the tide was shifting in campaigns of innuendo and guilt through leaks to the news media  If so  he said  the American justice system might also eventually clear him of other accusations never proven in court  such as ordering a contract murder  I always believe in justice   said Mr  Deripaska  whose lawyers have frequently fought to keep suits from being brought in American courts  saying they have no jurisdiction   For us outside the United States  Mueller signals that the U S  legal system is still alive  it still exists  Mr  Deripaska had faced scrutiny for financial entanglements with a former Trump campaign chairman  Paul J  Manafort  who in July 2016 reportedly asked an associate to offer Mr  Deripaska a private briefing on the presidential race  in hopes of settling a  26 million lawsuit stemming from a failed investment venture  The two had been business associates a decade ago  Mr  Deripaska had denied receiving the offer  but had not addressed these matters in detail while the investigation continued  There was a new reality in the U S  In politics  in social life  you do not respect presumption of innocence   he said  speaking of the sanctions imposed on him last year and leaks to the news media about the Russia investigation   There is no due process  Without any court  the public can consider people guilty of something  Mr  Deripaska was an early focus of the F B I  investigation into Russian meddling  In September 2016  two months before the election  F B I  agents questioned him in an early morning visit to his New York residence He declined to elaborate on the specific  written questions the special counsel later sent to Moscow  but said they generally tracked news media reports about prosecutors  suspicions  He did not answer on the advice of his lawyers  he said  Besides  he said   Why should I  ImageOnce business associates  Paul J  Manafort and Mr  Deripaska had fallen out by the time Mr  Manafort joined the Trump campaign in 2016 CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesMr  Manafort agreed to work for the Trump campaign for free  but did seek compensation elsewhere  In an email reported by The Washington Post  Mr  Manafort suggested to a former employee  Konstantin V  Kilimnik  that his dispute with the Russian tycoon might be resolved by offering  private briefings  about the campaign  Mr  Manafort also transferred internal Trump campaign polling data to Mr  Kilimnik  who the special counsel said had ties to Russian intelligence These circumstances still have congressional investigators alarmed   You might think it s O K  that the campaign chairman of a presidential campaign would offer information about that campaign to a Russian oligarch in exchange for money or debt forgiveness   Representative Adam B  Schiff  the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  said at a hearing last week   I don t  In the interview  Mr  Deripaska denied  as he had when The Washington Post first reported the offer of private briefings in 2017  ever having received from Mr  Manafort either an offer or any information about the campaign  For me  it s just absurd   he said   I had no interest in the U S  election  Why on earth  if I have no interest  would somebody offer private briefings to me   He last met Mr  Manafort in 2011  he said  It s not even sociable   he said of the reported offer of briefings   It looks like this  You haven t seen this guy  you know you have this huge sum of a dispute  and then you are like   Let s go and drink a cup of coffee   Mr  Deripaska said that he indeed suspended his multimillion dollar lawsuit against Mr  Manafort  but not because Mr  Manafort had asked him to do so or because he had received anything from the campaign chairman in return  My lawyers felt that might put me at risk  which anyway happened later  when Manafort appeared in the campaign   he said  referring to the eventual sanctions that came in 2018   They didn t want to bring more attention   to the business dispute with a man who had become prominent in American politics  he said  He later refiled the lawsuit In fighting to lift the personal sanctions  Mr  Deripaska must overcome years old accusations of ties to organized crime related to his path from the ashes of the former Soviet Union s aluminum industry to a billionaire with global reach  and allegations he is a front for the Kremlin on foreign policy matters Mr  Deripaska called these accusations  balderdash  and his lawsuit challenged the sanction on constitutional grounds  He also denied he is close to Mr  Putin  insisting he only deals with the government on matters of business regulation The conclusion of the special counsel s investigation  he said  gave him hope for success   I reaffirm to myself that the U S  systems  that U S  institutions  still exist   

KIEV  Ukraine   The candidate who placed third in the first round of Ukraine s presidential election conceded defeat Tuesday  but alleged the incumbent who came in second rigged the results in his favor Opinion polls had shown Yulia Tymoshenko  a former prime minister who has been a fixture in Ukrainian politics for two decades  leading the race until a few months before Sunday s election With nearly 99  percent of ballots counted  comic actor Volodymyr Zelenskiy had garnered 30  of the vote  President Petro Poroshenko was next with just under 16   while Tymoshenko received 13  That means that Ukraine s new president will be elected in a runoff between Zelenskiy and Poroshenko on April 21 In her concession remarks  Tymoshenko alleged Poroshenko had manipulated the vote  He should not be in the runoff   she said   He got there by cheating  Tymoshenko did not specify what kind of election interference she thought occurred  although she had accused Poroshenko in the days before the election of buying votes Speaking to reporters on a trip out of town  Poroshenko wouldn t comment on Tymoshenko s allegations and said that she  should put up with  her defeat at the polls The president promised a democratic election last week  saying Ukraine had a lot at stake Tymoshenko said she would not contest the election results because she believes Poroshenko controls the courts  She refused to endorse either Zelenskiy or Poroshenko for the runoff She said she and her party would now focus on the parliamentary election in the fall  which could give her a post in a new government  The chance we ve lost in the first round of the presidential election is just one chance   Tymoshenko said   We still have one opportunity left to bring in a dramatic change  to implement a new course  and this is the next parliamentary elections    Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O Rourke has said in recent weeks that his visiting all 254 counties in Texas during his failed Senate bid last year helped boost the state s voter turnout  That may be  but he s giving the wrong numbers on how much turnout among young people increased Since joining the presidential race last month  O Rourke has said in events from Iowa to Texas that youth voter turnout boomed during the race he narrowly lost to Republican Sen  Ted Cruz A look at his claim  most recently made during an event in El Paso  Texas  on Saturday O ROURKE   The state saw young voter turnout up 500  over the last midterm election  THE FACTS  Voter turnout by people under 30 did not jump nearly that much last year  Texas did see a large increase in those young voters  though More than 1 million young voters cast a ballot in the 2018 midterm election  a 234  increase from the 2014 midterm elections  according to voting data from the Texas secretary of state s office Initial reports suggested young voter turnout increased as much as 508  during early voting in Texas when compared with early voting in 2014  according to data released by a political consulting firm a week before the 2018 election O Rourke spokesman Chris Evans acknowledged his candidate used those figures without making the distinction that they represent an incomplete portion of early votes cast   not total turnout in the election Overall  voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election increased 77  in Texas over 2014 totals Dozens of other states saw gains in young voter turnout  according to Abby Kiesa  who researches youth turnout at Tufts University Kiesa said the 2018 midterm elections experienced a  strong trend  of voters under 30 casting ballots  A competitive Senate race and a number of groups that registered college students helped push those voters to the polls in Texas  where young voter turnout has been historically low  Something really significant happened in Texas   Kiesa said of the 2018 election   It s likely attributable to many factors     Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

MADISON  Wis    Conservative Brian Hagedorn s strong showing in Wisconsin s Supreme Court race cheered state Republicans Wednesday  with their first positive result in a statewide election since 2016 suggesting reasons for optimism next year in a critical presidential battleground Hagedorn led liberal backed Lisa Neubauer by 5 962 votes   less than half a percentage point   in a race that could still go to a recount  But it came after a string of losses by Republicans in special and statewide elections since Donald Trump carried the state While Republicans were excited  they were also cautious about what Hagedorn s showing means for President Donald Trump s re election  Nobody should assume because Republicans won this race that they will continue to win everything else   Republican strategist and former state GOP leader Brandon Scholz said   This is one election where all the pieces came together at the end  2020 is an entirely different  politically charged animal with the presidential race  Republican U S  Sen  Ron Johnson  who has been leading GOP efforts to rebound following the 2018 election  credited Hagedorn s showing with a ground up engagement with conservatives who were angry with attacks in the race and national Democratic priorities  This is the recipe for success   he said   That s what I ve been preaching since the day after the November 2018 election  We have to energize  rely on the grassroots  Hagedorn benefited from a late infusion of  1 2 million from the Republican State Leadership Committee  Conservative talk radio  including former Republican Gov  Scott Walker for three hours the day before the election  also worked to drive up turnout Republicans compared attacks on Hagedorn to those on U S  Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh  National political fights over the release of Robert Mueller s investigation into Trump and ongoing court battles over a lame duck legislative session in Wisconsin also fueled interest in the race  GOP strategists said Hagedorn said attacks against him over long ago blog writings  including calling Planned Parenthood a  wicked organization  and denouncing court rulings that favored gay rights  motivated his supporters Democrats took the result as a sign that despite a string of wins  including ousting Walker in November  nothing can be taken for granted  Not that Democrats needed it  but it s another wakeup call that every single election here is going to be highly competitive   said Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki   This is not a red state  This is not a blue state  This is the deepest shade of purple there is on the spectrum  Neubauer didn t immediately say whether she would request a recount  which would face a tough challenge in overturning such a large margin and which would come at her expense  She immediately appealed to supporters for money in case she pursues the recount  Counties have until April 12 to report final vote totals  and Neubauer has three days after that to request a recount The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been the deciding force in several partisan battles over policy in recent years  and is itself clearly partisan   conservatives hold a 4 3 edge  Democrats had hoped Neubauer would capture a seat currently held by a liberal justice  maintaining that spread but positioning them to win the majority in another election next year Unless Hagedorn s apparent victory is undone by recount  conservatives instead will enjoy a 5 2 majority and won t be at risk of losing it until at least 2023  The high court already looks likely to decide early disputes between new Democratic Gov  Tony Evers and majority Republicans in the Legislature Turnout was nearly 27   well above the 22  of last year s state Supreme Court race  Hagedorn overcame Neubauer s huge margins in the liberal strongholds of Madison and Milwaukee by running up the vote in Green Bay and more rural parts of northeastern and north central Wisconsin  Those are both parts of the state that helped fuel Trump s win in 2016 Wisconsin recounted its presidential vote in 2016 at Green Party candidate Jill Stein s expense  In that recount of nearly 3 million ballots  only 131 votes were changed   in favor of Trump  Neubauer  in a recount of just 1 2 million ballots  would have to pick up 45 times as many votes The 2016 presidential recount cost local election clerks  2 million   more than the  1 7 million Neubauer raised during the entire campaign through March 18  However  those costs included overtime for clerks who had to count nearly 2 9 million votes under a tight deadline due to the Electoral College Given the recent tight elections  Republicans are taking nothing for granted going into 2020  Johnson said  We have to run almost perfect elections going forward   he said  If  Democrats  are energized  we re going to have issues  Nobody will be overconfident  We know what s at stake        Associated Press writer Ivan Moreno contributed to this report from Pewaukee  Wisconsin  

NEW DELHI   Millions of Hindus will wake up at the crack of dawn this Saturday  five days before the start of India s general election  and march to nearby temples to chant a sacred hymn and renew a pledge to build a temple on the ruins of a 16th century mosque Hardline Hindu allies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  say they will mobilize more than 10 million people on April 6   the start of the Hindu New Year   to shore up support for the contentious plan to build a temple in the northern town of Ayodhya But while the event will keep the focus on a core demand of India s Hindu nationalists  it will not overtly be part of the BJP s election campaign  signaling a softer approach by the ruling party  multiple sources familiar with discussions said The commitment to construct a grand temple in Ayodhya to the Hindu god king Ram has been part of the BJP s election manifesto since the 1990s and has helped the party garner Hindu votes in state and federal elections since then However  the BJP and its allies are concerned that focusing on the temple issue could be too hot to handle  especially since it is now the party in power  It could worsen communal tensions and trigger religious riots in the country  said a senior BJP leader  We cannot underestimate the power of Hindu fringe groups  and it s best not to ignite these issues   said a BJP leader who is overseeing the party s election strategy The BJP leader and two other senior party members  two federal ministers and four members of hardline Hindu groups  who didn t wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue  said they reached a consensus to fold the temple issue into a broader religious and cultural discourse  without being too vocal about it Following a meeting between senior religious leaders and BJP politicians in January  the Vishwa Hindu Parishad  VHP  or the World Hindu Council  which is leading the movement for building the Ayodhya temple  put its agitation on hold in February Details of the meeting have not been published previously The VHP  which shares ideological ties with the BJP  would renew its demand only after the general election  its leaders said  While we remain committed to the cause that is so close to the hearts of Hindus  we re unanimous in our view that it s not the right time to amplify the temple issue   said Alok Kumar  international working president of the VHP   Politicization leads to controversies  HINDU MUSLIM RIOTSThe VHP has distributed pamphlets and issued appeals on social media to participate in a chanting ceremony aimed at renewing the pledge to build the temple on the spot where many Hindus believe Ram was born  where the mosque stood Sanjay Mayukh  a BJP spokesman in New Delhi  declined comment on the April 6 event being organized by the VHP  We wish them  VHP  a success and we will celebrate the Hindu New Year too   said Mayukh A militant Hindu mob tore down the mosque in 1992  sparking riots that killed about 2 000 people in one of the worst instances of sectarian violence in India since independence in 1947 The mosque  built by a Muslim ruler in 1528  has been one of the prime causes of conflict between India s majority Hindus and minority Muslims  who constitute 14 percent of the country s 1 3 billion people  India s Supreme Court is now in control of the site in Uttar Pradesh state and has been weighing petitions from both communities on what should be built there In March  the country s top court appointed an arbitration panel to mediate in the dispute  It s verdict is yet to come BJP election candidates confirmed they are avoiding the temple issue in their campaigns Former government minister and BJP lawmaker Sanjeev Baliyan  who is contesting the election from a constituency in Uttar Pradesh  said he has instructed supporters to  refrain from using the Ayodhya issue in any political rally   At least 65 people were killed in clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Baliyan s constituency in 2013  The danger of any religious tension spilling out of our control would change the election mood  Best to keep religious issues away from politics for now   he told Reuters Instead  Baliyan said  his campaign would focus on the BJP s achievements during its last five years in power and national security issues Most pollsters expect the BJP to emerge to win the highest number of seats in the election after recent military exchanges between India and arch enemy Pakistan led to a wave of nationalist fervor that has helped Modi But the pollsters say the BJP is unlikely to repeat its sweeping victory of 2014 because of the government s inability to provide jobs to the millions of youngsters coming into the job market each year and depressed rural incomes The BJP is also under fire from small business owners  traditional supporters of the party  who say they have suffered because of a rocky start to the Goods and Services Tax  India s biggest tax reform  and Modi s shock move to ban high value banknotes in 2016 The big question may be whether the BJP gets enough seats in the 544 member lower house of parliament to govern without having to form a coalition with other parties India begins voting on April 11 and the staggered election is scheduled to end on May 19  Results will be declared on May 23 Ambuj Nigam  the leader of the Vishwa Hindu Dal  a Hindu hardline Hindu group that came into existence in 2018  said the demand for a temple would again gain momentum after the general election  We have put all our controversial works on hold   said Nigam   But as soon as election results are out  we will bring Hindu nationalism back to the forefront    Additional reporting Zeba Siddiqui   Editing by Martin

BANGKOK   Thailand s influential army chief warned Tuesday that the military will fight any moves that threaten the country s system of constitutional monarchy with the king as head of state  in an apparent threat directed at supporters of a new anti junta party  The army does the army s duty  which is to protect  maintain  and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy   Gen  Apirat Kongsompong said at a news conference Apirat appeared to be targeting intellectuals backing the Future Forward Party  which according to preliminary figures ran a strong third in the March 24 general election Apirat s words  come as an intimidating knock out punch against any Thai political critics of Thailand s system of government   said Paul Chambers  a lecturer in political science at Naresuan University in northern Thailand   But more explicitly  the words seem to attack Future Forward Party  whose leaders have seemed particularly critical of the junta and military  and who in the past discussed the monarchy  Future Forward Party co founder Piyabutr Saenkanokkul used to be part of the Nitirat Group  legal scholars who sought reforms in Thailand s lese majeste law  which carries stiff prison terms for people found guilty of defaming the monarchy Apirat suggested that scholars who have studied abroad may have lost their understanding of the  Thai style democratic system  Pitabutr received his master s and doctoral degree in France  and other prominent members of the Nitirat Group studied law in Germany  Don t introduce the leftist views you learned that made you all pretentious   Apirat said The military backed Palang Pracharath Party won the most popular votes in the March polls  and its candidate  Prayuth Chan ocha  is likely to become prime minister  but could end up with the opposition holding a majority of seats in the House of Representatives  Prayuth led a 2014 coup that ousted an elected government and since then has served as junta chief and prime minister Supporters of the Future Forward Party believe the courts and the Election Commission may try to disqualify some of its winning candidates  or even the entire party  ahead of the release of official election results on May 9 Thai social media since the election has been buzzing with postings seeking to discredit the Future Forward Party One recently circulated video shows excerpts of a lecture Piyabutr gave in 2013  when he taught law at Bangkok s Thammasat University  He has said it was to explain the relationship of democracy to monarchies in political systems worldwide  But it has been cast by his party s opponents as criticism of Thailand s monarchy An obscure right wing group  Political Civic Group  said it has filed a complaint with the Election Commission about Piyabutr s statements  claiming they violated election law  He has denied the allegations against him and charged the video was taken out of context to undermine him Apirat also criticized activists who charge that the Election Commission mismanaged the polls and are seeking to impeach its members  Once the referee has made a ruling  you blame the referees  When boxers fight  this guy loses  and you blame the referees  If it s like this it will never end  It will be a never ending cycle of revenge and disapproval  How can it end  I ve said already   Apirat said  before taking a long pause   I don t want to say something too harsh  After becoming army commander  Apirat told reporters last October that he refused to rule out more coups if there is political unrest  If politics does not create riots  nothing will happen   he said His father  Gen  Sunthorn Kongsompong  helped carry out a 1991 coup and served as junta leader for more than a year  

ANKARA   Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul urged the High Election Board  YSK  on Wednesday to confirm him as the elected mayor after it ruled in favour of a partial recount of votes in 18 of the city s 39 districts Initial results from Sunday s mayoral elections showed the opposition Republican People s Party  CHP  had narrowly won control of Turkey s two biggest cities  Istanbul and Ankara  in a shock upset for President Tayyip Erdogan s ruling AK Party If those results are confirmed in the coming days  the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32 6 billion liras   5 79 billion  for 2019 in Istanbul  Turkey s commercial hub  and the capital Ankara Erdogan   who campaigned hard for the AKP ahead of the vote   would likely lose some oversight for local contracts in the two cities  possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession  However the AKP submitted objections to election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara  saying the results had been impacted by invalid votes and voting irregularities In Istanbul  CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu  and his AKP rival  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  both said on Monday that Imamoglu was about 25 000 votes ahead  a relatively slim margin in a city of some 15 million people The chairman of the Election Board  YSK   Sadi Guven  said on Wednesday it had ruled that the recount of what had been marked as invalid votes should go ahead in eight Istanbul districts  some of them AKP strongholds  but added that appeals were still underway The state run Anadolu news agency later said the YSK decided to recount invalid votes in 15 districts and all votes in three other districts as a result of the appeals  The AKP had said previously there were more than 300 000 invalid votes  Six of the 18 districts being recounted were initially won by the CHP  one by the nationalist MHP  and the rest by the AKP  according to Anadolu  Imamoglu called on the YSK to  do its job  and name him mayor  accusing the AKP of disrespecting the people of Istanbul  We want justice  We demand our mandate from the YSK  which has given the numbers  as the elected mayor of this city    The world is watching us   he told reporters After Imamoglu spoke  the hashtag  MazbatamiziVerin  Give our Mandate  was the top trending topic on Twitter in Turkey AKP Deputy Chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said his party was not doing anything illegal and added that the vote difference between Imamoglu and Yildirim had fallen to below 20 000 votes  We believe the reality will emerge tonight and we will all accept the results   Yavuz told reporters LOCAL PURSE STRINGSPro government newspapers on Wednesday said there had been a conspiracy against Turkey in the local elections  with the Star newspaper likening this to an attempted military coup in 2016 and nationwide protests in 2013  Yeni Safak newspaper editor Ibrahim Karagul called for a second vote after what he termed a  coup via elections   adding without providing evidence that supporters of the U S  based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen   blamed by Ankara for the 2016 coup attempt   were involved In Ankara  opposition candidate Mansur Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes on Sunday  nearly 4 percentage points ahead of his AKP rival  Recounts were planned in 11 Ankara districts due to AKP appeals  Anadolu said In some 100 rallies during his election campaign  Erdogan had described the opposition alliance as terrorist supporters linked to Gulen s network and Kurdish militants Erdogan s political success has rested on years of stellar economic growth in Turkey  but a recession that has brought surging inflation and unemployment and a plunging lira have taken their toll on the president s popularity While Erdogan s ruling alliance won a nationwide majority of just under 52 percent of all votes  losing Ankara and Istanbul   where he started his political life   would significantly dent his dominance  It is by controlling the municipality that you keep your support happy because it is at the municipal level that you give away lots of things to your core base   said Wolfango Piccoli  co president of Teneo political risk advisers While official results have not yet been announced  Erdogan has said his alliance had won the majority of municipal councils across Istanbul and Ankara  The AKP has said this was a sign of irregularity in the vote count Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to volatility in the Turkish lira  which sold off sharply nearly two weeks ago  reflecting waning confidence among both Turks and international investors  The lira was flat on Wednesday but slipped 2 percent on Tuesday after relations with Washington soured following a U S  decision to halt delivery to Turkey of equipment related to the F 35 fighter aircraft Adding to investor concerns over fraying diplomatic ties and possible U S  sanctions over the F 35 aircraft and missile defence  the U S  State Department urged Ankara to respect the  legitimate election results  Ankara responded by warning against foreign interference and  any steps that may be construed as meddling in Turkey s internal affairs     Additional reporting by Can Sezer  Daren Butler  Ali Kucukgocmen  and Dominic Evans in Istanbul  Editing by Jonathan Spicer and Gareth Jones  

ISTANBUL ANKARA   Election officials expanded a vote recount in Istanbul late on Thursday  CNN Turk said  as the ruling party of President Tayyip Erdogan pushed its appeal against its shock defeat there in local elections Erdogan s AK Party said it would also demand a wider check on votes across the capital Ankara   which initial results suggested it also narrowly lost in Sunday s vote in a major blow to the establishment Those losses  if confirmed  would be particularly painful for Erdogan  whose party and its predecessor have dominated the two cities for 25 years  He launched his political career in Istanbul and served as the city s mayor in the 1990s On Wednesday  Turkey s High Election Board had ordered a full recount in three of Istanbul s 39 districts and a recount of just invalid ballots in 15 districts after an appeal from Erdogan s AKP Late on Thursday the board decided there would be a full recount in those 15 districts as well  CNN Turk said  Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul  Ekrem Imamoglu  told Reuters it looked like his lead had narrowed to around 19 500 votes from an earlier 25 000 as the recount progressed  but he was sure he would still become mayor  The results will not change  Time is passing and Istanbul is waiting for service  so we just want to get to our job as soon as possible   said Imamoglu of the Republican People s Party  CHP   The mathematics and numbers are clear   Imamoglu told Reuters   There is no need to think of a Plan B right now  Imamoglu later said on Twitter that recounts in Istanbul s 14 districts  where there were a total of 89 255 invalid votes  had been completed  and added that he was 18 871 votes ahead of his rival The AKP s representative on the election board  Recep Ozel  told broadcaster A Haber earlier on Thursday that the difference in Istanbul would keep falling and his candidate  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  would emerge the winner in Turkey s commercial hub Speaking at a news conference in Ankara  AKP spokesman Omer Celik said the steps taken for recounts were not extraordinary  All citizens should remain calm  Our democracy is showing its strength as it always has   Celik said   Let the law work and let s respect the outcome  RECESSION CHALLENGEAhead of the elections  the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival the alliance between the AKP and their nationalist MHP partners  They named joint candidates in certain cities  including Ankara and Istanbul In Ankara  opposition candidate Mansur Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes on Sunday to earn a nearly 4 percentage point victory over his AKP rival  former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki  The AKP also appealed against those results  prompting the election board to order a recount in 11 of the city s districts But AKP Secretary General Fatih Sahin said on Thursday that the results of the recount so far were  far from meeting our expectations  and the party would appeal for another recount across the city If the initial results are confirmed  the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32 6 billion liras   5 79 billion  for 2019 in Istanbul and Ankara Erdogan would likely also lose some oversight for municipal contracts in the two cities  possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession In another sign of public backlash  the AKP MHP alliance also lost control of the southern coastal cities of Antalya  Mersin and Adana  the central provinces of Bolu and Kirsehir  and the eastern cities of Artvin  Igdir and Ardahan The CHP has said that Kurdish votes coming from the pro Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party  HDP  had helped them win narrow victories in key provinces  after the HDP chose not to name candidates in some cities and back the opposition instead  Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics since coming to power 16 years ago and ruled his country with an ever tighter grip  campaigned relentlessly for two months ahead of Sunday s vote  which he described as a  matter of survival  for Turkey In some 100 rallies during his election campaign  Erdogan described the opposition as terrorist supporters and said his central government could not provide services if it wasn t in harmony with local administrations But the president s efforts came up against widespread anger about Turkey s recession  which has brought surging inflation and unemployment  and caused the lira to plunge Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to volatility in the currency  which sold off sharply nearly two weeks ago  reflecting waning confidence among both Turks and international investors  It closed at 5 63 to the dollar on Thursday   Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay in Ankara and Yesim Dikmen in Istanbul  Editing by Jonathan Spicer  Andrew Heavens and James Dalgleish

The chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and one of the state s leading political donors together sought to use campaign contributions to bribe the state s insurance commissioner  federal prosecutors said in an indictment that was unsealed on Tuesday The 23 page indictment   detailed with accounts of clandestine airport meetings and promises of millions of dollars in illicit donations   intensified the political tumult in a state already roiled by partisan warfare and a fraud tainted congressional election  And it also showed how  at least in the judgment of prosecutors  a leading political operative and one of his most important benefactors tried to shape government oversight in one of the nation s largest states  These men crossed the line from fund raising to felonies when they devised a plan to use their connections to a political party to attempt to influence the operations and policies of the North Carolina Department of Insurance   said John A  Strong  the special agent in charge of the F B I  office in Charlotte  N C The party chairman  Robin Hayes  faces the gravest set of charges of the four men who were indicted  Mr  Hayes was accused of bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud  along with several counts of making false statements  Three other people  including Greg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham and a prolific Republican contributor  were also charged Kearns Davis  a lawyer for Mr  Hayes  said the 73 year old Republican  steadfastly denies the allegations made against him in this case   In a separate statement  Anne Tompkins  a lawyer for Mr  Lindberg  said that Mr  Lindberg was  innocent of the charges in the indictment and we look forward to demonstrating this when we get our day in court  It was not clear whether the other men who were charged had lawyers A federal magistrate in Charlotte unsealed the case on Tuesday after the men were arrested   a public milestone in an investigation that began early last year with a tip from Mike Causey  the insurance commissioner According to the indictment  Mr  Lindberg  who has also given to Democrats  wanted Mr  Causey to oust a powerful regulator  in exchange for millions of dollars in campaign contributions   The targeted state official was in charge of overseeing North Carolina s regulation of a company that Mr  Lindberg owned  and Mr  Lindberg complained to Mr  Causey in February 2018 that the official was  deliberately and intentionally and maliciously hurting my reputation with other regulators  Mr  Lindberg said the official had been  lying  to Mr  Causey The next month  federal officials said  Mr  Lindberg and Mr  Causey met alone at the Statesville Regional Airport  What s in it for me   Mr  Causey asked Mr  Lindberg  according to the indictment Mr  Lindberg replied that he would support the commissioner s campaign for re election Mr  Hayes  one of the most influential political figures in the state  emerged as someone who could help carry out the plan  Federal officials said that Mr  Hayes knew at least some of the plot in May 2018 and  less than three months later  tried to disguise part of the bribe by arranging to transfer to the Causey campaign  250 000 that Mr  Lindberg had given to the state party Before the transfer  one of Mr  Lindberg s consultants  John D  Gray  called Mr  Hayes to say the men had  come to the conclusion that it would be better for all of us  if the money for the Causey campaign was funneled through the Republican Party  O K   well  if that s what you want to do  we can do it   Mr  Hayes replied  according to the indictment   It looks a little odd to have that much at one time  You know  we were talking about putting it over  you know  so much a month so it didn t jump out  but that s what you want to do  we can do it  Within weeks  prosecutors said  Mr  Hayes lied to F B I  agents about his efforts In a statement on Tuesday  Mr  Causey said his department  continues to cooperate with the federal authorities on this investigation   He otherwise declined to comment The indictment landed at a perilous moment for the Republican Party in North Carolina  Although Donald J  Trump carried the state in 2016  Democrats seized the governor s office that year  and last year s elections eroded the Republican supermajority in the General Assembly The party also suffered a stinging embarrassment in February  when the State Board of Elections ordered a new vote in the Ninth Congressional District after the Republican nominee s campaign financed an illicit voter turnout operation during the general election  Although no major Republican Party figures have been charged with wrongdoing  the man who coordinated the improper effort was indicted in connection with wrongdoing in earlier elections  and state and federal officials are conducting parallel inquiries into the general election  Read  A new election was ordered in North Carolina s Ninth Congressional District  On Monday  Mr  Hayes announced that he would not seek another term as state party chairman  In a statement announcing the decision  the party cited  recent  although temporary  issues with his mobility  After Mr  Hayes s indictment was announced on Tuesday  a lawyer for the state party  Josh Howard  said the party had become  aware of several indictments surrounding the conduct of a major donor to both major political parties and two of his associates  Mr  Howard  who spoke of the party s cooperation during the federal inquiry  did not mention that its leader had also been charged  

SRINAGAR   India s northern state of Jammu and Kashmir is to restrict civilian traffic on a main state highway for two days a week in a bid to ward off militant attacks on security convoys as a general election nears  state authorities said on Wednesday On Feb  14  40 Indian security personnel were killed when a suicide bomber from a Pakistan based militant group attacked a security convoy at Pulwama in Indian controlled Kashmir The attack has heightened tensions between the two nuclear armed neighbours  each of which sent warplanes to attack the other s territory after the attack Civilian traffic will be banned from 4 a m  to 5 p m on Sunday and Wednesday each week until May 31 to allow for exclusive movement of security convoys India s staggered election begins on April 11 and ends on May 19 The prohibition will apply between Baramulla region and Udhampur  covering most of the 350 km  217 mile  Srinagar Jammu highway  which passes through the state s major towns The highway is the main artery connecting disputed Kashmir to the rest of India The decision was taken  keeping in view the large movement of security forces on the national highway during the parliamentary elections and associated possibility of any fidayeen terror attack on security forces  convoys   the statement said Fidayeen is a term used to describe Islamist militants engaged in suicide missions   Writing by Aditya Kalra  Editing by Kevin Liffey  

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena that Democrats can use to try to force the Justice Department to hand over an unredacted copy of the special counsel s report and underlying evidence The move on Monday by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  the committee s chairman  made clear that Democrats are not satisfied with Attorney General William P  Barr s assurances on Friday that he will produce a full  albeit redacted  copy of the nearly 400 page report to Congress by mid April  As I have made clear  Congress requires the full and complete special counsel report  without redactions  as well as access to the underlying evidence   Mr  Nadler said in a statement   The attorney general should reconsider so that we can work together to ensure the maximum transparency of this important report to both Congress and the American people  The committee s announcement came a day ahead of a deadline set by Mr  Nadler and five other House committee leaders for Mr  Barr to voluntarily hand over the material collected by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III Mr  Barr appeared all but certain to miss it The urgency among Democrats came  in part  because they mistrust Mr  Barr s assessment of the report in a four page letter he sent to Congress late last month  The letter said that Mr  Mueller had not found that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to subvert the 2016 election  and that although Mr  Mueller did not offer a prosecutorial judgment on whether Mr  Trump obstructed justice  Mr  Barr had determined the president s actions were not illegal Democrats control the Judiciary Committee by a sizable margin and most likely will not need Republican support to approve the subpoena  If approved  it would be up to Mr  Nadler to determine when and if to issue it   effectively increasing pressure on Mr  Barr to meet Democrats  demands The committee s top Republican  Representative Doug Collins of Georgia  appeared to oppose a subpoena on Monday  saying Democrats had grown  desperate  despite Mr  Barr providing  transparency above and beyond what is required   Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not  in truth  require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department   Mr  Collins said in a statement Indeed  in his Friday letter to Mr  Nadler and other congressional leaders  Mr  Barr wrote that the Justice Department and special counsel s team were scrubbing the report to redact secret grand jury testimony  classified material and information about other continuing federal investigations  He also agreed to testify publicly in early May about his handling of the case In addition to authorizing a subpoena for the Mueller report  the Judiciary Committee will vote on Wednesday on subpoenas for five key witnesses in its investigation into possible obstruction of justice  abuse of power and corruption within the Trump administration The individuals are Donald F  McGahn II  a former White House counsel who spoke extensively with Mr  Mueller s investigators  Stephen K  Bannon  the president s former chief strategist  Hope Hicks  a former White House communications director  Reince Priebus  the president s first chief of staff  and Annie Donaldson  a deputy of Mr  McGahn who took detailed notes on the president s behavior during key episodes in his administration The five were among 81 individuals  companies and government entities from which the committee requested documents last month to kick start its investigation  Mr  Nadler said he would not have to use the subpoenas if the witnesses changed course and complied voluntarily  

I used to favor amending the Electoral College  in part because I believed the framers put it into the Constitution to protect slavery  I said as much in a book I published in September  But I ve decided I was wrong  That s why a merciful God invented second editions Like many historians  I thought the evidence clearly showed the Electoral College arose from a calculated power play by the slaveholders  By the time the delegates at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 debated how the president ought to be chosen  they had already approved the three fifths clause   the notorious provision that counted slaves as three fifths of a person to inflate the slave states  apportionment in the new House of Representatives The Electoral College  as approved by the convention in its final form  in effect enshrined the three fifths clause in the selection of the president  Instead of election by direct popular vote  each state would name electors  chosen however each state legislature approved   who would actually do the electing  The number of each state s electoral votes would be the same as its combined representation in the House and the Senate By including the number of senators  two from each state  the formula leaned to making the apportionment fairer to the smaller states  Including the number of House members leaned in favor of the larger states  But the framers gave the slaveholding states the greatest reward  The more slaves they owned  the more representatives they got  and the more votes each would enjoy in choosing the president The framers  own damning words seem to cinch the case that the Electoral College was a pro slavery ploy  Above all  the Virginia slaveholder James Madison   the most influential delegate at the convention   insisted that while direct popular election of the president was the  fittest  system  it would hurt the South  whose population included nonvoting slaves  The slaveholding states  he said   could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes   Instead  the framers  led by Madison  concocted the Electoral College to give extra power to the slaveholders If you stop at this point in the record  as I once did  there would be no two ways about it  On further and closer inspection  however  the case against the framers begins to unravel  First  the slaveholders did not need to invent the Electoral College to fend off direct popular election of the president  Direct election did have some influential supporters  including Gouverneur Morris of New York  author of the Constitution s preamble  But the convention  deeply suspicious of what one Virginian in another context called  the fury of democracy   crushed the proposal on two separate occasions How  then  would the president be elected  if not directly by the people at large  Some delegates had proposed that Congress have the privilege  a serious proposal that died out of concern the executive branch would be too subservient to the legislative  Other delegates floated making the state governors the electors  Still others favored the state legislatures The alternative  and winning  plan  which became known as the Electoral College only some years later  certainly gave the slaveholding states the advantage of the three fifths clause  But the connection was incidental  and no more of an advantage than if Congress had been named the electors Most important  once the possibility of direct popular election of the president was defeated  how much did the slaveholding states rush to support the concept of presidential electors  Not at all  In the initial vote over having electors select the president  the only states voting  nay  were North Carolina  South Carolina and Georgia   the three most ardently proslavery states in the convention Southerners didn t embrace the idea of electors because it might enlarge slavery s power  they feared  as the North Carolinian Hugh Williamson  who was not a slaveholder  remarked  that the men chosen as electors would be corruptible  persons not occupied in the high offices of government   Pro elite concerns were on their minds   just as  ironically  elite supporters of the Electoral College hoped the body would insulate presidential politics from popular passions When it first took shape at the convention  the Electoral College would not have significantly helped the slaveowning states  Under the initial apportionment of the House approved by the framers  the slaveholding states would have held 39 out of 92 electoral votes  or about 42 percent  Based on the 1790 census  about 41 percent of the nation s total white population lived in those same states  a minuscule difference  Moreover  the convention did not arrive at the formula of combining each state s House and Senate numbers until very late in its proceedings  and there is no evidence to suggest that slavery had anything to do with it But didn t the college  whatever the framers  intentions  eventually become a bulwark for what Northerners would later call the illegitimate slave power  Not really  Some historians have revived an old partisan canard that the slaveholding states  extra electoral votes unfairly handed Thomas Jefferson the presidency in 1800 01  They ignore anti Jefferson manipulation of the electoral vote in heavily pro Jefferson Pennsylvania that offset the Southerners  electoral advantage  Take away that manipulation  and Jefferson would have won with or without the extra Southern votes The early president most helped by the Constitution s rejection of direct popular election was John Quincy Adams  later an antislavery hero  who won the White House in 1824 25 despite losing both the popular and electoral votes to Andrew Jackson   The House decided that election   As president  the slaveholder Jackson became one of American history s most prominent critics of the Electoral College  which he blasted for disallowing the people  to express their own will   The Electoral College system made no difference in deciding the presidency during the 36 years before the Civil War There are ample grounds for criticizing the Constitution s provisions for electing the president  That the system enabled the election in 2016 of precisely the kind of demagogic figure the framers designed the system to block suggests the framework may need serious repair  But the myth that the Electoral College began as a slaveholders  instrument needs debunking   which I hope to help with in my book s revised paperback Read

BANGKOK   Thailand s ruling military junta has filed a complaint accusing the leader of a popular new political party of sedition and aiding criminals  a move he described as politically motivated The party  Future Forward  ran a strong third in elections last month that were also contested by a pro military party Future Forward s leader  Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  said he would report to police on Saturday to answer the summons against him  He could face up to nine years in prison The summons did not specify what actions prompted the complaint  It said Thanathorn was accused of sedition for using words or writing  to raise unrest and disaffection amongst the people in a manner likely to cause disturbance in the country  Several criminal complaints and protests to the Election Commission have already been lodged against Thanathorn and his party Speaking to reporters on Wednesday before a tour of a Bangkok neighborhood to thank voters  Thanathorn said the new legal action was expected and  nothing new   We are prepared mentally  There s nothing to worry about   he said   We believe in our innocence  We believe these cases are politically motivated  Thanathorn commented further about the summons on his Facebook page  saying it was clear  that old political games don t end after elections but in turn become even more intense because they are afraid of Future Forward  afraid of our victory that surpassed many people s expectations  He said he would answer the summons to show his innocence and  prove that Thailand s justice system will not submit to becoming a tool for dictators  Preliminary results of the March 24 general election failed to give any single party a majority  making it unclear whether pro  or anti junta parties will hold a majority in the House of Representatives  The Future Forward Party is a junior partner in an anti junta coalition that claims have a majority of seats  but the final official results won t be released until May 9 Between now and then  there could be shifts in party alliances  and there is concern that the state Election Commission  widely regarded as sympathetic to the junta  could disqualify the elected candidates of its opponents The army has several times publicly shown its disdain for Future Forward s policies  The country s influential army chief on Tuesday issued a thinly veiled attack on the party  not mentioning it by name but implying that it has foreign influenced ideas unsuitable for the  Thai style democratic system   which is a constitutional monarchy Gen  Apirat Kongsompong  the ruling junta s secretary general  said the army would do its duty   which is to protect  maintain and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy  Respect for the monarchy is a sensitive and emotional issue in Thailand  and accusations of disrespect are sometimes used by opportunists to smear their political opponents  Thailand has a lese majeste law that makes criticism of the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years  imprisonment per offense Thanathorn has said his party s primary agenda is to stop Thailand s military from intervening in politics  and also suggested its budget be slashed The new party s critics also have tried to tried to sow suspicion that it is allied with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  who was ousted by the military in a 2006 coup and is treated as the arch enemy of Thailand s royalist establishment  The party denies any such ties  and a large part of its appeal appears to be that it supports neither the military nor Thaksin The co founder of Future Forward  law scholar Piyabutr Saengkanokkul  has come under pressure as well  including a summons to be a witness in what appears to be Thanathorn s case Piyabutr has been in hot water with conservative Thais who see him as a threat to the monarchy after social media began circulating a video of a Feb  17  2013  lecture in which he described the role of the monarchy in democratic governments  He responded that the posting was misleading and was not about Thailand s system An obscure conservative organization filed a complaint about him with the Election Commission  and on Wednesday singer and actress Haruthai Muangboonsri formally submitted a legal complaint to police accusing him of being a threat to national security The military has governed Thailand since then army commander Prayuth Chan ocha staged a coup in 2014 against an elected government  Since then  Prayuth has served as junta leader and prime minister  and is the candidate of the pro military Palang Pracharath Party  which according to preliminary results grabbed the biggest share of the popular vote in last month s election According to a new constitution implemented under the junta  prime ministers are chosen by a joint vote of the elected House of Representatives and the appointed Senate  giving Prayuth a great advantage  However  his opponents could still control a majority in the lower house  making it difficult for him to pass laws or get a budget approved  and making any government he would head unstable because of the possibility it would face a vote of no confidence

unofficial vote at 99 percent  conservative candidate Brian Hagedorn held a lead of about 1 600 votes over his liberal backed challenger Lisa Neubauer  The margin was about 0 14 percentage point out of nearly 1 2 million votes cast That is well within the 1 percentage point difference that allows the trailing candidate to request a recount The Associated Press did not declare a winner  noting that the race was within the margin for a recount Neubauer campaign manager Tyler Hendricks says the race is  almost assuredly headed to a recount  The court is currently controlled 4 3 by

Supreme Court race says the contest is  too close to call  and  almost assuredly headed to a recount  As the unofficial vote count was nearly complete  conservative Brian Hagedorn and liberal backed candidate Lisa Hagedorn were separated by just over 3 000 votes out of more than 1 1 million cast That is well within the 1 percentage point difference that allows the trailing candidate to request a recount Neubauer campaign manager Tyler Hendricks says  We are going to make sure every vote is counted  Wisconsinites deserve to know we have had a fair election and that every vote is counted  The court is currently controlled 4 3 by conservatives  A Hagedorn win would increase it to 5 2 and insure that liberals don t have a chance at taking control in next year s election    10 20 p m Liberal backed Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Lisa Neubauer has a slight lead over her conservative opponent in a race that was within the margin for a recount as the vote count neared completion Neubauer led by less than 7 000 votes out of more than 1 million cast  or a little over a half percentage point If the loser is within 1 percentage point of the winner  they may request a recount  The last time that happened in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race was in 2011 A Neubauer win would put liberals in position to capture majority control of the court next year  A Hagedorn victory would increase the conservative majority to 5 2 and ensure it will be maintained for years Both Hagedorn and Neubauer are state appeals court judges  The race is officially nonpartisan but is seen as a potential

race after early returns Neubauer was ahead of Hagedorn by about 7 percentage points with more than a third of precincts reporting totals Tuesday A Neubauer win would put liberals in position to

a new state Supreme Court justice say the partisan backgrounds and support of the candidates in the officially nonpartisan race are a major factor Appeals court judges Brian Hagedorn and Lisa Neubauer are facing off in Tuesday s election  Hagedorn was former Republican Gov  Scott Walker s chief attorney and is backed by conservatives  Neubauer was appointed by a Democratic governor and has liberal support Lana Nenide  of Madison  says she voted for Neubauer because she wants a Democratic woman representing her rights  not  Scott Walker s puppet  Kathy Halverson  a Republican from Franklin  says she chose Hagedorn because  he has morals   Halverson says Hagedorn will  judge according to the law  Conservatives have a 4 3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court    7 a m Polls are open in Wisconsin for voters to choose a new state Supreme Court justice to serve a 10 year term The winner in Tuesday s election will replace 85 year old Justice Shirley Abrahamson  who is retiring Conservatives have been in the majority on the court since 2008  currently with a 4 3 split  If state appeals court Judge Brian Hagedorn wins the race  it would increase their majority A win by fellow appeals Judge Lisa Neubauer would give liberals a chance to take control of the court in the 2020 election Voter turnout in past Supreme Court races in non presidential years has generally been around 20   Voters need a photo ID to cast their ballots  Polls close at 8 p m    12 a m Wisconsin voters face a partisan choice in an election for the state Supreme Court The outcome of Tuesday s race won t immediately change the ideological control of the court  But a victory by liberal backed Lisa Neubauer would make it possible for liberals to win majority control in the 2020 election  She faces fellow state appeals court Judge Brian Hagedorn He was former Republican Gov  Scott Walker s attorney for more than five years before Walker appointed him to the bench in 2015  Neubauer was appointed by former Democratic Gov  Jim Doyle  Her family has deep ties to the Democratic Party Both Neubauer and Hagedorn insist their personal views do not affect how they would rule on the Supreme Court But liberal outside groups backed Neubauer  while Hagedorn won support from conservatives

ROME   Italy s ruling League party might not forge any more electoral pacts at a national level with its traditional ally Forza Italia  a senior League politician said on Tuesday  signaling the possible end of an era The League has struck repeated alliances with former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia over the past two decades  including at a parliamentary election in March 2018 However  the center right bloc  which also includes the nationalist Brothers of Italy  failed to win an outright majority in that vote  leading to three months of political stalemate  In the end  the League formed a coalition with the anti system 5 Star Movement  leaving Berlusconi in opposition  If we were to vote before the end of the year     I do not know if it would be possible to run again in a centre right alliance   said Riccardo Molinari  the League s parliamentary party leader in the lower house Molinari  who is close to League chief Matteo Salvini  stressed that he did not expect any national election this year  but said if his party performs strongly in EU parliamentary polls in May it might seek more power within the government The centre right bloc still stands together in local elections and has won seven successive regional votes over the past 12 months    most recently last month in Basilicata  At a national level  there is the question of the political vision you want to have  which is very different from local problems   Molinari told foreign reporters  noting the different views of Europe held by the eurosceptic League and more mainstream Forza Italia He did not mention Brothers of Italy  which is ideologically much closer to the League and a more natural partner Although the ruling coalition is constantly riven with tensions over a variety of issues  Molinari said League and 5 Star lawmakers got along well  while their two parties still commanded a clear majority in the polls  The longer we govern with 5 Star  the more it enters the public conscience and it would be hard to understand why the League  subsequently  would run with the centre right   he said The League s own support has roughly doubled from last year s election  with recent polls putting it on around 33 percent  By contrast  backing for 5 Star has dropped to around 22 percent from 33 percent a year ago Molinari said if the polls were borne out in next month s EU ballot then the balance of power would change within the government  If we get more votes than 5 Star  as seems likely  we will try to make our ideas weigh more on certain issues than is the case now   he added   We will clearly have greater weight  but we will want to use it to push the government forward not to break it apart    Reporting by Crispian Balmer  Editing by Catherine Evans

MILWAUKEE   With their recent selection of Milwaukee for their party s 2020 convention  Democrats left little doubt that they believe their path to the White House runs through the Midwest in general and Wisconsin in particular Their optimism spiked in November  when Democrats defeated Scott Walker  the state s two term conservative governor  And they were energized and optimistic again this week for an intensely politicized State Supreme Court election they hoped would show Wisconsin trending steadily blue Then reality hit  A conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory on Tuesday  underscoring instead how competitive Wisconsin politics remain For Democrats  an intense effort to rebuild their Midwestern  blue wall  for 2020 is showing gains in Michigan and Pennsylvania  both of which President Trump captured in 2016  On Tuesday  Democrats flipped a key Pennsylvania State Senate seat that Republicans had long held outside Pittsburgh  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  But in Wisconsin  the apparent loss of the State Supreme Court race   Judge Hagedorn leads by nearly 6 000 votes and a recount is possible   underscored what strategists in both parties said in interviews this week  The state is a tossup in 2020 and its political identity is very much in flux  Republicans know they need this state and are going to fight like hell to keep it in President Trump s column   said Joe Zepecki  a Democratic strategist in Wisconsin  He said that Mr  Walker s loss in November may have fired up the conservative base just as Hillary Clinton s 2016 loss did for Democrats last November  They re coming with everything they ve got   he said of Republicans   That means we have work to do  Wisconsin s reputation as a battleground state is well earned  In the three closest presidential elections of recent times   2000  2004 and 2016   Wisconsin was decided by the narrowest average margin of any other state  less than one percentage point in each election Mr  Walker lost his re election bid for governor by less than one percentage point  after warning all year of a coming blue wave  Over the weekend  Mr  Walker offered a pep talk to Republican activists in Milwaukee about the stakes in electing Judge Hagedorn  a former lead counsel to his administration  who defended contentious election issues such as a voter ID law  Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field  Democrats wanted to defeat Judge Hagedorn and gain a liberal Supreme Court majority  Mr  Walker warned  so they could seize control of redistricting after 2020 and  get rid of one  maybe two seats that we currently have in the House of Representatives  Democrats  haven t forgotten about how close the election was  in 2016  Mr  Walker told party activists gathered for breakfast at the American Serb Hall in Milwaukee   They re not going to make that mistake again  ImageA conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory for the State Supreme Court on Tuesday  underscoring how competitive Wisconsin politics remain CreditRick Wood Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  via Associated PressMark Jefferson  executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party  said Judge Hagedorn s apparent victory showed the power of the party s engaged conservative base  The grass roots took offense to the attacks on Hagedorn s Christian faith   he said  referring to news accounts that the judge founded a Christian school that allows firing teachers in same sex relationships But others say Mr  Walker s midterm loss is probably a more relevant bellwether for 2020 than the Supreme Court race  because turnout was more than twice as high  and Mr  Walker is a polarizing  partisan figure in Wisconsin  much like the president Barry White  a lawyer who voted for Mr  Walker in 2010 but snubbed him in 2018 in favor of his Democratic opponent  Tony Evers  said he had wanted to make a bigger point  His ballot was  a repudiation of Trump and Republicans that insist on carrying his water   Mr  White said   It was the only message I could send  Mr  White lives in the Milwaukee suburbs  the state s most populous Republican region  Mr  Evers s gains there last year were a key to his narrow victory  In an interview  Mr  Walker said that should be a lesson to Mr  Trump   To win  he s going to have to improve his numbers in the suburbs   he said   With the passion the opposition is going to have  he s going to have to make some inroads  Last fall  Mr  Walker matched his vote totals from 2014 in the three suburban counties outside Milwaukee  But a surge of Democratic votes in the demographically changing suburbs meant his vote share dropped in 2018 by 12 percentage points in Waukesha County and by 16 points in Ozaukee County  It s the paradox of Trump s strategy of appealing to his base constantly   said Charles Franklin  director of the Marquette Law School Poll of the state   It also helps gin up the feelings of your opposition  I think that it s a gift to Democrats that keeps on giving  One of those voters is Tiffany Duncan  a 26 year old employee of a printing company  who skipped the 2016 election because she didn t like either major party candidate  But she definitely plans to vote in 2020   for whichever Democrat takes on Mr  Trump   I didn t think Trump was this crazy   she said as she walked to Caf Bavaria in Wauwatosa Village Still  Mr  Franklin said  the state is so evenly divided  its chances of determining an Electoral College majority for either party  puts us at ground zero  In a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than Mr  Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president  meaning his path to a second victory in the state is both uphill and narrow Many of today s uncertain voters   who are Republicans or Republican leaning independents   may come home to the party  especially once there is a Democratic nominee to contrast with the president John Carlson  a 59 year old engineer in Milwaukee  is one of those gettable voters for both parties  He went for Mr  Trump in 2016 but is uncertain if he will do so again  Democrats could win him over  he said    if the Democrats came up with somebody reasonable  which I m not expecting them to do  Republicans are framing the Milwaukee convention as an opportunity to motivate their own base  expecting Democrats to showcase a parade of far left figures and policies  National Republicans have already begun a coordinated effort to paint Democrats as wild eyed radicals steering the country toward socialism ImageIn a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than President Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times Democrats were energized in 2018  like any party is out of power during the first midterm  but then decided to go off the rails once they seized control of the House   said Rick Wiley  a former political director of the Republican National Committee  whose roots are in Wisconsin  The president energizes base Republicans and has had great success with working class voters   he said in an email   Those same working class voters won t check the box on a progressive socialist nominee  Mr  Jefferson of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he was upbeat about Mr  Trump despite public polling  I expect to see the same thing this cycle as 2016  where all polling suggests it s an uphill battle and on Election Day things look a lot different   he said   I think the Democrats are once again overplaying their hand and a little too confident  When Mr  Trump holds rallies aimed at Wisconsinites  he visits media markets across northern and western regions  largely agricultural and rural  where in 2016 he outperformed earlier Republican nominees In the Supreme Court race  Judge Hagedorn  the conservative  got a major boost in the Green Bay and Wausau markets  enough to overcome a deep deficit in Dane County  which includes Madison  the state s bluest stronghold In the 18 counties in the Green Bay media market  where TV ads linked Judge Hagedorn to Mr  Trump  voters swung by 18 points toward the conservative compared with a State Supreme Court election last year won by a liberal judge  according to an analysis by Craig Gilbert of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel The Saturday before Election Day  there was

populace is small  Mr  Trump s ability to run up the score in such places was repeated all across rural America in 2016  He won Kewaunee County  a dairy region  by 28 points compared with Mitt Romney s six point margin as the 2012 Republican nominee  I m tired of politicians  he s not a politician   said Randy Boor  57  who works in a factory that makes commercial cookware  He judged Mr  Trump s chances of carrying the state in 2020 as even better than in 2016  We ve got a guy there that s delivering   he said   He wants to do the frickin  job  You know how much could get done if he wasn t being opposed by all these idiots  Another beer taster  Dave Soborowicz  a 47 year old plumber  had driven across the state from Eau Claire to attend the event with his brother  who wore a Trump hat  But Mr  Soborowicz was less enamored of the president and unsure if he would vote for him the next time   He s so bloated in his head that he thinks he s still going to get his frickin  wall  when he s been defeated   he said Mr  Soborowicz said business was good for him as a plumber but he wasn t ready to give Republicans and the president credit   All I know is it was a bad winter   he said   so we were very busy   

MADRID   Spain s Podemos was the rising star of Europe s far left four years ago  but infighting and a failure to evolve has left it a shadow of the newcomer party it was then as it gears up for the country s most open election in living memory At best  it might emerge from the April 28 ballot as a junior partner in a Socialist led government  but that outcome would require support from other parties likely to be hard to win over Its decline underlines the challenge  in Spain and elsewhere across Europe  of forming viable governments once new parties emerge to break the political status quo Podemos was instrumental in setting that pattern as a European trend in a national election in 2015 Founded a year earlier out of the anti austerity movement against Europe s debt crisis  it won 20 percent in that vote  finishing a close third behind the conservatives  PP  and the Socialists  PSOE  and dismantling the monopoly on power those two parties had held since Spain s return to democracy in the late 1970s Now Podemos is down to around 12 percent  its appeal dented by scandals and divisions over how hard line the party  which supported a minority Socialist government over the past ten months and sits on some local councils  should be   We have caused shame due to our internal fights  our top officials and our visibility   leader Pablo Iglesias told a rally in March   We have acted like any other political party   With polls showing no single party anywhere close to securing an absolute majority on April 28  Podemos remains one of five parties  also including far right Vox  with a chance of being part of a governing coalition But its hopes of partnering the Socialists would likely rest on outgoing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also persuading skeptical Basque and Catalan nationalists to join that alliance In 2015  Podemos  meaning  We Can   surged on a groundswell of anti austerity support as protesters occupied the Puerta del Sol square in Madrid for weeks during the debt crisis  inspiring similar movements elsewhere in Europe and the United States It came within 350 000 votes of the Socialists  unprecedented for a non mainstream party  But that election was inconclusive and  by the time a fresh ballot was held six months later  Podemos had lost one million votes as the initial excitement waned Since then the party has also fragmented In January  Podemos  co founder Inigo Errejon left to launch another movement  a defection political analysts linked to his failure to maintain the party s wider appeal as a counterweight to Iglesias  more far left stance NO LONGER  BREAKING THE SYSTEM  Sanchez has said nothing about possible post election coalitions But while his Socialists lead in opinion polls  his options for securing a second term appear largely dependent on how Podemos fares  especially after the center right Ciudadanos ruled out an alliance  The right s options also appear limited  and a repeat election is a distinct possibility The dilemma of managing a fragmented or deadlocked political system is one that Spain shares with several neighbors  Politics have ruptured from Italy to France and Greece as the after effects of the 2009 14 debt crisis and austerity linger In Greece  things turned out differently for the anti austerity left  Its standard bearer  Syriza  has governed since 2015  supplanting the establishment Pasok socialists by accepting the strings attached to bailouts and changing from radical to reformer Podemos instead chose a harder line    In Greece s case  we drank from that particular chalice  we were disappointed and returned to pragmatism   said Theodore Couloumbis  a political analyst in Athens  But  without being in government  Podemos has also been forced to compromise through its representatives on local councils and as a PSOE ally  The party has become normal when it got into power   said Jose Fernandez Albertos  a political scientist at the Spanish National Research Council   Voters see that it will no longer break the system  If it manages to get into government  Podemos is likely to see its influence limited by its drop in votes  but could still have an impact  as it has done by pushing the Socialists on issues such as increasing the minimum wage  Its usefulness is to maintain the Socialists on the left   Fernandez Albertos said In neighboring Portugal  the Left Bloc also gained from its anti austerity stance during the debt crisis but lost support since it became an ally of the ruling Socialists in 2015 That minority government  also supported by the Communists  has achieved stability  potentially giving Sanchez and Iglesias a model to emulate But the Socialists and Podemos barely poll 40 percent together  leaving them far short of a majority and needing to quickly attract more votes from elsewhere  Rafael Mayoral  a member of the Podemos executive  said the party still enjoyed broad appeal  telling Reuters   We are a popular force that defends working people  from top to bottom  But that hasn t stopped it from splintering  In a regional election in Madrid next month  it will run on three different platforms

LONDON   Berenberg economists on Wednesday increased their estimate of the likelihood Britain stays in the European Union s customs union after Prime Minister Theresa May said she would work with opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to break the deadlock on Brexit  May s speech signals a pivot away from her own idea of a free trade agreement with the EU towards a softer Brexit that could win a majority in parliament   wrote Berenberg s Kallum Pickering and Holger Schmieding  They upped the probability of the UK staying in the customs union to 45 percent from 35 percent  and cut the likelihood of the current Withdrawal Agreement being passed to 5 percent from 10 percent  Berenberg said the move to compromise with the opposition makes an overturning of Brexit less likely  and cut their probability of a  no Brexit  outcome to 20 percent from 25 percent  A general election could still be on the cards  though   Corbyn could refuse to offer a compromise acceptable to moderate Conservatives and or insist on a confirmatory referendum in the hope of fracturing the Conservative party and trigger a snap election   the economists wrote They raised their estimate of the likelihood of a Corbyn led government to 20 percent from 15 percent    Reporting by Helen Reid  editing by Danilo Masoni

PARIS   Algeria s ailing president  Abdelaziz Bouteflika  agreed Monday to step down by the end of the month  yielding to weeks of mass demonstrations demanding his ouster The initial reaction in Algeria was muted  and it was unclear whether the announcement would quell the protests  which have been calling for not only Mr  Bouteflika s resignation but the end of  the system  he led With no date set for a new election and no sign of the departure of Mr  Bouteflika s allies  some of his opponents were skeptical about the prospect of immediate  fundamental changes  Who is going to replace President Bouteflika   asked Smain Kouadria  a former member of Parliament and an activist in the opposition Workers  Party   All the senators are children of the system  So this announcement of his resignation is simply part of the rescue operation for a dying system  ImageProtesters demonstrating against Mr  Bouteflika in Algiers last month  The protests have only grown larger despite his previous concessions CreditRamzi Boudina ReutersMr  Bouteflika  82  who has ruled Algeria for 20 years  is paralyzed and has not publicly addressed the country since 2013  The protests began last month after he announced that he would run for a fifth term  and they have escalated each week With support from his former allies steadily dropping away  the final blow for Mr  Bouteflika came last week when the powerful army chief of staff called on the country s Constitutional Council to declare Mr  Bouteflika unfit to hold office But even though Mr  Bouteflika is departing  much of the ruling elite he put in place   which protesters refer to simply as  the system    is not On Sunday night  Mr  Bouteflika even appointed a new government  naming the general who had called for his ouster

likeliest to assume the position of interim president is the head of the senate  who has been close to Mr  Bouteflika for years A stage managed departure seemed unlikely to satisfy the street  which has increasingly helped drive the country s political agenda  an unusual development in Algeria s nearly 60 year  post independence history Even some opposition leaders who welcomed the news on Monday urged continued protests  It s a first important victory for the people   said Said Salhi  vice president of the Algerian Human Rights League   But we can t stop here  We ve got to demand positive change toward the emergence of a new  democratic republic   We ve got to continue to mobilize   he added   It s our only guarantee of movement toward final victory  which is the construction of a new republic of rights and liberties  ImageA protest demanding the resignation of Mr  Bouteflika on March 29  The protests began in February with demonstrations calling for him to desist from seeking a fifth term CreditRamzi Boudina ReutersThe situation in Algeria is fluid  with the balance of power appearing to shift every day  It is unclear how much more protest the army  which traditionally is the ultimate arbiter  will tolerate  Nor is it clear how radical the protesters will become in their demands There were other signs Monday of a shift in power  with the authorities seizing the passports of 12 businessmen on corruption allegations  according to Ennahar television  which is usually well informed  The government news service confirmed that corruption investigations had been opened against  some people  While it was not clear why the 12 were targeted  a businessman arrested on Sunday is considered a Bouteflika crony  Ali Haddad  the country s wealthiest man  who owns the country s top construction firm and has grown wealthy from lucrative state contracts  was arrested at the Tunisian border Mr  Haddad is known to be close to Mr  Bouteflika s hitherto influential brother  Said The question for Algerians now is whether Mr  Bouteflika s resignation will lead to real change or whether it is another in a series of feints intended to allow him and his system to retain power ImageNoureddine Bedoui  center  was re appointed as prime minister of Algeria s new government  He is widely described as inflexible CreditRyad Kramdi Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe protest movement began in late February with mass demonstrations calling for Mr  Bouteflika to desist from seeking a fifth term  After Mr  Bouteflika agreed to call new elections if he won the election  originally scheduled for April 18  the protests only grew larger Then he said he would not seek a fifth term  but would remain in office until a successor was chosen in an election that was indefinitely postponed  That offer only seemed to embolden the protesters  who demanded that he step down immediately and that his system had to go as well This is a far more complicated demand  and those who have been pulling the strings for years in Algeria   the army and an extensive nexus of politicians  top businessmen and high civil servants   have been improvising to keep up with the largely peaceful demonstrators  who have turned out in increasing numbers each Friday Mr  Bouteflika learned at the knee of his mentor  the revolutionary leader Houari Boumdine  who ruled Algeria from the mid 1960s to the late 1970s  Like Mr  Boumdine  Mr  Bouteflika installed an extensive patronage network and governed in partnership with the army  The system they and other Algerian rulers put in place is solidly anchored and will probably take more than a month s worth of popular demonstrations to dislodge The muted reaction on Monday suggested that Algerians know that  So Bouteflika is finished  Now everyone knows it   said Atmane Mazouz  a member of Parliament from the opposition Rally for Culture and Democracy party   The struggles now are only little positioning wars to control the next phase of the transition  But I am almost certain that the mobilization of Algerians will continue stronger than ever  because all the decisions being made now are seen by Algerians as a conspiracy against their revolution

800 times while another on Twitter has 22 000 views Messages and e mails to Dandiya  an avid Facebook user who last appeared in a live video on March 23  went unanswered  The home ministry  the BJP president and party s information technology chief did not respond to requests for comment The videos underline how social media companies are struggling with fake news in India despite saying they ve taken steps to tackle the menace ahead of India s general election  which starts on April 11 With 900 million people eligible to vote and an estimated half a billion with access to the internet  fake news can have an enormous impact on the election  Dandiya s video  for example  could have seriously damaged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP if enough people thought it was true Policing content has become a massive global problem for social media giants which have no template for consistently preventing online fake news or eliminating it  Fierce internet disinformation battles gripped countries such as Brazil and Malaysia last year ahead of elections  Authorities in Indonesia and the EU  which are due to hold polls  have warned of the threat of fake news In India  Facebook has partnered with fact checkers and  like Twitter  ramped up efforts to block fake accounts  On Monday  Facebook said it had deleted 1 126 accounts  groups and pages in India and Pakistan for  inauthentic behaviour  and spamming  many linked to India s opposition Congress party  Google has partnered with fact checkers to train 10 000 journalists this year to better tackle fake news Facebook s popular messaging app WhatsApp has launched newspaper and radio campaigns to deter the spread of misinformation Social media companies say they don t outrightly remove all fake posts as that would jeopardise free speech  Facebook has said that circulation of posts which are debunked  or discovered to be fake  is reduced by more than 80 percent NO SILVER BULLETPosts that violate Facebook s community guidelines  including hate speech or content that could incite violence  are completely deleted  the company said  adding that Dandiya s video came under that category But even when content has been identified as fake and removed  slightly modified versions of the same images  video or text can escape detection and spread further  This is a highly adversarial space  so we still miss things and won t catch everything   but we re making progress   said a Facebook spokeswoman  who added that the overall volume of false news had been reduced on the platform   There s no silver bullet solution in fighting misinformation  Twitter said it deeply cares about the potentially harmful effects of misinformation and encourages users not to share unverified information  A YouTube spokesman said the company will continue to embrace the  democratization of access to information  while providing a reliable service to users Twitter and YouTube did not comment on Dandiya s video  SHOWN TO BE FALSE Another fake post that went viral recently was on popular Indian student leader Kanhaiya Kumar  who was arrested and charged with sedition after a 2016 rally to commemorate the execution of a Kashmiri separatist  Opposition parties said Kumar s arrest by federal police was an attempt by authorities to curb free speech Some Facebook posts in February described Kumar as anti India and showed his photo in front of a map that depicted some Indian states as part of Pakistan  Two Facebook fact checkers in India investigated the posts and said the image was doctored  Still  a month later  Reuters found at least two copies of those posts on Facebook with 375 comments and 1 500 shares Facebook in February announced an expansion of its fact checking company partners to seven  from two  Facebook says it also issues an alert to users who try to share a post which its fact checkers have debunked  but doesn t prohibit further sharing Reuters found that when debunked posts of Kumar were shared  an alert popped up with a link to the fact checkers  analysis  However  all four variants of Dandiya s videos could be shared without such fake news alerts from Facebook  There is no way you can solve this problem  quickly      the magnitude of the problem is really huge   said Kanchan Kaur  a Bengaluru based assessor at International Fact Checking Network at U S  based Poynter Institute FACT CHECKING BUSINESSWhen tensions rose between India and Pakistan in February following a suicide bombing in Kashmir and cross border air strikes  social media was flooded with fake news   old videos of captured pilots and photos of earthquake hit regions were spread as depicting current events  Since Pulwama we ve been working seven days a week   said Jency Jacob  managing editor at BOOM  referring to the site of the suicide attack  On a recent visit to BOOM s office in India s financial capital Mumbai  five people were seen monitoring and analysing online content  One of the rooms served as BOOM s studio where television style news videos are shot on debunked stories and published on its website As an industry  fact checking is fast spreading in India  British broadcaster BBC has in house fact checking operations and a dedicated WhatsApp number where anyone can flag suspected fake posts for further checks  A dedicated team of journalists is debunking fake news daily  and also writing detailed explainers on controversial issues and claims   BBC s India Digital Editor  Milind Khandekar  told Reuters Former software engineer Pratik Sinha and his mother are part of a 10 member fact checking initiative named  Alt News  which is run from a two bedroom flat in the western city of Ahmedabad Using online video verification and social media tracking tools  Sinha said his team debunks up to four posts each day Debunked posts appearing online has become a problem even for India s Election Commission In February  a WhatsApp message called for spreading the word that said Indians living overseas could  now vote online for 2019 elections  and should register on the Commission s website  The Commission called it  FAKE NEWS  on Twitter and filed a police complaint against  unknown persons  for public mischief A month later  the message continues to circulate on Facebook   a user who shared it on March 23 has so far received 42 likes and 19 shares  When someone questioned the post  the Facebook user responded   I think you can vote  Just check the web site and follow the steps    Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal and Aditya Kalra  Additional reporting by

OTTAWA   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday sought to quell a crisis that threatens his chances of re election  expelling from party ranks two former Cabinet members he said had undermined the ruling Liberals Trudeau said former Justice Minister Jody Wilson Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott would no longer be allowed to sit as Liberal legislators  They were also barred from running for the party in the federal election this October The Liberals have been in turmoil since Wilson Raybould said in February that officials had inappropriately pressured her last year while she was justice minister to ensure that construction company SNC Lavalin Group Inc escape a corruption trial  The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken   Trudeau told an emergency meeting of caucus  Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them   said Trudeau  47  who took office in November 2015 and faces a tough re election battle this autumn Wilson Raybould  who tweeted news of her ouster before Trudeau s announcement  was demoted in January and resigned the next month  Philpott quit shortly afterward  saying she had lost confidence in how Trudeau was handling the matter  If people can t express trust in the party and the prime minister  then they need to find another political vehicle in order to advance their ideas  It s as simple as that   Justice Minister David Lametti told reporters  The expulsion represented a change of course for Trudeau  who said as recently as last week that the Liberals needed strong legislators with differing points of view But increasingly angry parliamentarians had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity Opinion polls show the crisis has cut public support for the Liberals to such an extent that they could lose in October to the official opposition Conservatives Trudeau  who came to power promising  sunny ways  and a greater role for women in politics  admitted it  has been a difficult few weeks  The scandal also cost him the services of his closest aide  Gerald Butts  and Michael Wernick  the head of the federal bureaucracy Wilson Raybould said on Twitter   I have no regrets  I spoke the truth as I will continue to do   Last Friday  to back her case  she released the audio of a confidential conversation with Wernick  who did not know she was recording him  Trudeau said that was  unconscionable  Philpott said on Facebook that she  did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister     it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course  regardless of its short term and long term consequences  Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing  The scandal is starting to hit his fortunes in the populous province of Quebec  where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in October to remain in power Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau s decision sent a message that  if you tell the truth  there is no room for you in the Liberal Party    Reporting by Steve Scherer and David Ljunggren  Editing by Grant McCool and Peter Cooney

CHICAGO   Chicago  known for its machine politics and corruption  woke up Wednesday to voters choosing an anti establishment candidate who may shake up a city that made history by electing its first African American woman for mayor  Voters in the third largest U S  city on Tuesday elected Lori Lightfoot  who has never held office  in a runoff election  She easily defeated long time local politician and a fellow black woman  Toni Preckwinkle  72  to become the city s 56th mayor Chicago has now become the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  and an openly gay woman as well  The 56 year old Lightfoot is also the latest in a wave of political newcomers to win major elections around the globe as voters upend the status quo  propelling anti establishment candidates to power  She will now take over a city where politics is a blood sport and where corruption has swirled in and around City Hall for generations  But Chicagoans are ready for a change  Lightfoot said on the campaign trail  promising to support mayoral term limits  reforms that would ban elected officials from profiting from their governmental positions and strengthen worker compensation oversight  They want a break from the corrupt political machine that has held back the aspirations of so many people   Lightfoot said during a debate last week   They want a government that is responsive to them and that has integrity   The city got its reputation as a well oiled political machine from the way Richard J  Daley  one of the last big city  bosses   ran the city from 1955 to 1976 with help from armies of patronage workers and crooked city council members  Thirteen years later  his son Richard M  Daley became mayor and for the next 22 years  he ran the city as the powerful political machinery churned in the background  It s refreshing to see somebody who is different  hopefully   said Andrew Tabor  61  a consultant who has lived in Chicago his entire life  Tabor recalled an incident from  years ago  when the so called machine allegedly sent a message to a childhood friend s father who had political connections  They blew up his car  I don t know who he was not playing nice with  but someone blew up his car  That s the machine right there   Tabor said sitting in the living room of his home on the north side days before the historic vote  NOT PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH Lightfoot has held several positions in and out of government  She was an assistant United States attorney  a senior equity partner at Mayer Brown LLP and  most notably  the president of the Chicago Police Board  an independent civilian panel   Some on the left  including Preckwinkle  criticized her as not being progressive enough  noting she made millions as a corporate lawyer representing corporate clients  She and Preckwinckle earned spots on the runoff ballot after they garnered the most votes among 14 candidates  including Richard M  Daley s younger brother Bill  in a February election  Lightfoot will replace Rahm Emanuel  who announced in September he was not seeking a third term as mayor Voters saw Lightfoot as the anti establishment choice compared with Preckwinkle  who was a city council member  or alderman  for almost 20 years before becoming Cook County board president in 2010   Lightfoot will bring more change because Preckwinkle is connected to the old boys club  the establishment   said retired mailman Gary Muckle  77  after voting for Lightfoot this weekend at a polling place on the city s north side   We will have to see what happens now  Lightfoot is not beholden to anyone   he said Lightfoot will also face a raft of thorny problems such as reforms to the police department  rampant gangs and violent crime and a spiraling budget deficit fueled by escalating pensions  Emanuel leaves as corruption continues to seep throughout city hall  Just this year  Alderman Ed Burke  a long time political powerhouse in Chicago  was charged with extortion  Alderman Willie Cochran pleaded guilty to wire fraud and it was revealed Alderman Danny Solis was recently under investigation for corruption  Burke  who has been an alderman for 50 years  won re election in February In all  federal prosecutors racked up 246 public corruption convictions in the Northern Illinois District  which includes Chicago  from 2010 to 2017  That is 80 percent more than in the Southern District of New York  located in Manhattan  according to a report from the Department of Political Science at University of Illinois at Chicago  The race turned on reform of Chicago politics and moving towards a new Chicago   said Dick Simpson  a professor in the department  who studies Chicago politics  noting that 33 city council members have gone to jail over the last four decades   There seems to be a desire to make reforms so that the continuing pattern of corruption     would change permanently   said Simpson  a former city council member    Reporting by Brendan O Brien in Chicago  editing by Bill

LONDON   Twenty five lawmakers in Britain s opposition Labour Party have urged their leader  Jeremy Corbyn  to go the  extra step  if there is a chance of agreeing a Brexit deal in talks with Prime Minister Theresa May May  whose deal to leave the European Union has been rejected in parliament three times  has turned to Corbyn in a last ditch bid to get the support of his Labour Party for an agreement she signed with the bloc s leaders in November Corbyn has welcomed the talks  but the invitation poses a threat for his divided Labour Party   some members and lawmakers are demanding a second referendum on any deal while others fear being blamed for helping pass May s much criticized agreement  The 25 lawmakers  almost all from areas which voted to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum  said the talks  represent a real opportunity  for Corbyn  a way to get a deal which would meet Labour s demands for a Brexit that protected workers  rights They reminded him in the letter that he had told May Labour would support a  sensible deal  that included  a customs union and no hard border in Ireland   protected jobs and workers  environmental and consumer standards   We believe you are close to achieving that in the coming days   said the letter whose signatories include Labour s schools spokesman Mike Kane and three lawmakers who last week voted in favor of May s deal  Rosie Cooper  Caroline Flint and Kevin Barron  At the general election  we were clear about respecting the 2016 vote  and about securing those Labour goals  Therefore  we feel if compromise is necessary to achieve this deal and avoid fighting the European elections  we should go the extra step to secure this   Corbyn  a long standing critic of the EU  has long said he wants Britain to leave the bloc with a deal  respecting the 2016 referendum when 52 percent of voters backed leaving the bloc in Britain s biggest shift in policy since World War Two But the opposition leader has been content to watch the governing Conservative Party take on Brexit  a move that has not only divided the country  but has all but redrawn the political landscape by widening rifts in the main parties In a last gamble  May announced she would bring Corbyn into talks to try to find a way to break the deadlock in parliament  which has voted against leaving the bloc without an agreement  Corbyn is pressing his desire for a  permanent customs union  and alignment with the EU s single market in the talks   red lines for a prime minister who had made controlling immigration one of the key stones of her Brexit policy But the Labour leader is under growing pressure to make any agreement with May conditional on holding a confirmatory referendum on the deal  or asking the public to back it in another vote The 25 lawmakers said such a vote was not part of Labour policy  Our policy  agreed by members  accepts that the public voted to leave the EU and seeks a deal that secure jobs and rights at work  It does not require a confirmatory ballot on any deal that meets those conditions   the letter said  Delaying for many months in the hope of a second referendum will simply divide the country further and add uncertainty for business  A second referendum would be exploited by the far right  damage the trust of many core Labour voters and reduce our chances of winning a general election    Reporting by Elizabeth Piper  editing by Guy Faulconbridge  

MADISON  Wis    Wisconsin s high stakes Supreme Court race was too close to call and appeared headed for a recount Tuesday With the unofficial vote at 99   conservative candidate Brian Hagedorn held a lead of about 1 600 votes over his liberal backed challenger Lisa Neubauer  The margin was about 0 14 percentage point out of nearly 1 2 million votes cast  close enough for Neubauer to request a recount paid for by taxpayers The Associated Press did not declare a winner  noting that the race was within the 1 percentage point margin for a recount The last recount in a Wisconsin Supreme Court election was in 2011  This race is too close to call   Neubauer campaign manager Tyler Hendricks said in a statement   We are almost assuredly headed to a recount  We are going to make sure every vote is counted  Wisconsinites deserve to know we have had a fair election and that every vote is counted  Conservatives have been in the majority since 2008  currently with a 4 3 split  Their majority would increase to 5 2 if Hagedorn defeats Neubauer  A win by Neubauer would give liberals a chance to take control in 2020 The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been the final word in some of the most partisan battles in the state over the past decade  It has upheld several polarizing laws passed by the Republican controlled Legislature  none more so than GOP former Gov  Scott Walker s law that essentially eliminated collective bargaining for public workers Now with Democratic Gov  Tony Evers often at odds with the Republican controlled Legislature  the Supreme Court s role could be even more crucial in settling disputes  Already  cases fighting laws passed by Republicans during a December lame duck legislative session appear headed to the court Tuesday s outcome will also be read for clues to the 2020 election cycle  with Wisconsin seen as a critical battleground for presidential hopeful  Expected low turnout could make that difficult  Past Supreme Court races in non presidential years has generally been around 20  Both Neubauer and Hagedorn are appeals court judges and insist their personal views would not affect how they would rule on the Supreme Court There has been no public polling in the race  but Neubauer raised more money than Hagedorn    1 7 million to  1 3 million Hagedorn  41  served as a law clerk for conservative state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman  Hageman served as an assistant attorney general  worked in private practice and was Walker s chief legal counsel for nearly five years  Walker appointed him to the state appeals court in 2015  and Hagedorn won election two years later Madison resident Lana Nenide  a 43 year year nonprofit director  said she voted for Neubauer   I want a Democratic woman representing my rights  I don t want Scott Walker s puppet   she explained Kathy Halverson  a 50 year old Republican from Franklin  said she voted for Hagedorn because  he has morals   He will judge according to the law and I just really like his stance on the topics   abortion  I think he s fair and he s going to be an asset to the Supreme Court   she said   Hopefully he will get in  Hagedorn  an evangelical Christian  spent much of the race defending his conservative beliefs  Opponents have pointed to a blog he wrote as a law school student in the mid 2000s in which he called Planned Parenthood a  wicked organization  and denounced court rulings favoring gay rights by likening homosexuality to bestiality  They have also pointed to his founding of a conservative private school that allows for expelling students who are gay  Hagedorn was also paid  3 000 to give speeches at meetings of the Alliance Defending Freedom  a group that supported criminalizing sodomy and sterilizing transgender people Neubauer  61  was appointed to the appeals court in 2007 by former Democratic Gov  Jim Doyle  Neubauer was elected to the appeals court in 2008  re elected in 2014 and has been chief judge since 2015  She spent almost 20 years as an attorney in private practice Judy Johnson  76  an independent voter from Franklin  said her vote for Neubauer reflected her dislike of President Donald Trump  Johnson said she believes Neubauer  will vote for the people   rather than supporters of the president Nearly every judge who has endorsed a candidate in the race   more than 340  or 98    backs Neubauer  Hagedorn has endorsements from the National Rifle Association and Wisconsin Right to Life The winner will serve a 10 year term and replace retiring liberal Justice Shirley Abrahamson  who is 85       Associated Press writer Ivan Moreno contributed to this report from Franklin  Wisconsin

WASHINGTON    Not any longer  And with that  a triumphant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to close the book Tuesday on a divisive Republican debate  convincing President Donald Trump to shelve plans to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters It was a rare public disclosure of private counsel from the Republican leader  And it signaled that  after two years in Trump s Washington  Republicans on Capitol Hill are figuring out how to handle the president and his impulsive swerves on policy Trump insisted Tuesday it was his idea to switch course  I wanted to delay it myself   Trump said during an event at the White House   I want to put it after the election  Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week  backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   he said Speaking later Tuesday at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump said   Republicans should not run away from health care      If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose  Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  The president stunned Republicans last week by announcing he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  insisting the GOP could become the  party of health care   Republicans wanted no part of a do over after their failure to replace the law in 2017  Facing a revolt from the ranks  McConnell told the president he needed him to listen  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Several times McConnell told Trump to listen  the person said  And it worked  Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much  So we don t have a misunderstanding about that   McConnell said Tuesday Trump s shift   he tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections  when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House    made clear that the health care debate will be left for voters to decide during the race for the White House That arrangement suits Democrats just fine  They are denouncing Trump s attempt to overturn the ACA in court and floating various health care plans  including an expansion of government funded Medicare with so called  Medicare for All   setting up a stark contrast between the parties for the campaign trail Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will  hold Americans hostage through 2020  on an issue that affects millions of people  He said that Trump  insists he has a magic plan that we can see if only the American people re elect him  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats  health care battle with Trump is  a values fight  After Trump dropped the issue on Republicans last week  many hoped it would just go away  They had no comprehensive proposal to replace the ACA law and no big plans to unveil one  Publicly and privately  Republicans tried to talk to Trump McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking Rep  Mark Meadows  R N C   a Trump confidant  called shifting the debate to 2021  a very pragmatic decision   He said Tuesday that  spending quality time to develop a comprehensive strategy  would be  critical  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s 2010 health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017 when Republicans controlled both chambers in Congress  He still blames the late Sen  John McCain for joining other senators to oppose a last ditch plan While Republicans gained Senate seats last fall  GOP senators   particularly those up for re election next year   weren t looking for another fight over the law  They saw how the issue played in 2018  when Democrats made it the cornerstone of their successful drive to win back the House Preserving health care protections  and especially for people with pre existing conditions  resonates with voters  According to AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide  nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care at the top of a list of key issues As Democrats have blamed Republicans for trying to end the ACA  GOP backed challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts Last week  the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down  an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured In his late Monday tweets  Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that  will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America  Republicans appeared relieved that  for now  that battle will be fought during the campaign  rather than in Congress The No  2 Senate Republican  John Thune of South Dakota  said the president  has some big ideas and  to his credit  wants to solve problems   But Thune said   you run into that wall of reality   of a divided Congress with Democrats in control of the House  which requires bipartisanship  Trying to convey what the obstacles are to getting what he wants to get done in the next two years is something I think a number of our members conveyed to him   Thune said    Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram

LONDON   Britain could ask the European Union for a long Brexit delay that gives the option to leave as soon as a divorce deal is approved by parliament  finance minister Philip Hammond indicated on Wednesday European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said in Brussels that Britain would not get any further short delays unless its parliament ratified a deal by April 12   the date set by EU leaders as the effective cut off for avoiding the European Parliament elections Hammond said there did not have to be a vote on a deal by the April 10 EU Council summit and that while there would be big advantages to doing that it was probably unlikely   The important thing now is that in any extension that we get from the EU  we have an absolute clarity that as soon as we ve done the deal  we are able to bring that extension to an end   Hammond told ITV  So it s less about the nominal length of time of the extension and more about the mechanism for bringing it to an end once the deal is done   he said   That would be our expectation  When asked if he was comfortable about a long extension  he said he was not comfortable about it but that the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May s deal meant  we are where we are  Hammond said he hoped talks with the opposition Labour Party would very quickly allow an understanding of whether a cross party deal was viable  Some kind of customs arrangement is clearly going to be a part of the future structure   Hammond said  He said that if talks with Labour failed  the government would try to take ideas from the discussions and present them to parliament  If a deal was passed by the eve of the May elections  then they could be pulled  Hammond said  The Sun newspaper said May would seek a delay of nine months As many as 15 ministers in May s government are on the edge of resigning over her Brexit talks with the opposition Labour Party  The Sun reported Five of those considering resigning are cabinet ministers  the newspaper said  Many  many colleagues in government are just seething and a lot of us are on the edge now   the newspaper quoted one unidentified minister as saying    Editing by Guy Faulconbridge

OTTAWA   After promising an open and collaborative way of doing politics  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada on Tuesday axed from his party two prominent former female cabinet ministers who have been at the center of a festering political crisis about his handling of a criminal case Trying to divert the country s attention from the controversy  Mr  Trudeau was in a tough spot politically The two women were seen by many as symbols of his progressive feminist government  But within his Liberal Party  they were seen as untrustworthy backstabbers who kept the firestorm alive for weeks with new morsels of information feasted upon by the press and opposition parties The problems began two months ago when accusations surfaced that Mr  Trudeau and his aides inappropriately pressured Jody Wilson Raybould  the former justice minister and attorney general  to settle a criminal corruption case against SNC Lavalin  a major corporation based in Montreal  A criminal conviction would bar the company from government contracts for a decade Mr  Trudeau has denied that anything inappropriate took place  He said he proposed a civil resolution of the case  with a monetary penalty  because a loss of government contracts by SNC Lavalin would jeopardize thousands of Canadian jobs Still  the criminal prosecution has continued And since then  the standing of the Liberals has fallen in the polls  And Mr  Trudeau s image as a fresh force who practiced politics in a new and transparent way has been severely battered With their re election hopes dimming less than seven months before the national vote  several Liberal members of Parliament have openly expressed frustration with Ms  Wilson Raybould  who resigned from the cabinet on Feb  12  and with Jane Philpott  who was president of the Treasury Board  and later resigned in solidarity with her  It s become clear that Ms  Wilson Raybould and Ms  Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team   Mr  Trudeau told an emergency meeting of the Liberal members of Parliament Tuesday evening   Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided  We cannot afford to make that mistake  He added   In learning to do things and doing them differently  we ve encountered difficult moments  Ms  Wilson Raybould said on Facebook on Tuesday night that she will speak with her supporters about what to do next  I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles   values that must always transcend party   she wrote In a separate Facebook message posted Monday night  Ms  Philpott expressed dismay about not being able to make her case to the national caucus before she was exiled from it  The need has never been greater for a measured re evaluation of how the government should respond to this issue   she wrote   What I have heard from Canadians is that they want to know the truth   Jenny Kwan  a member of the New Democratic Party from British Columbia  said Mr  Trudeau s action undermined his claim of being a feminist  This is about really speaking truth to power and the government shut it down   she said But Carolyn Bennett  the minister of Indigenous Relations  tried to repair any damage  telling reporters after Mr  Trudeau spoke that the prime minister s commitment to feminism was not a sham  It s not about gender   she said  saying that her former colleagues had to go simply because they could not be trusted Until Tuesday  Mr  Trudeau had studiously avoided criticizing either of his former ministers   I ve approached this situation with patience and understanding   he said ImageThe former attorney general  Jody Wilson Raybould  appearing before the House of Commons Justice Committee in February CreditSean Kilpatrick The Canadian Press  via Associated PressBut he called last week s revelation that Ms  Wilson Raybould secretly recorded a conversation with the country s top public servant  unconscionable The two were discussing the case against SNC Lavalin  which has been charged with bribing Libyan officials during the dictatorship of Col  Muammar el Qaddafi Mr  Trudeau s government was asking Ms  Wilson Raybould to consider using a new measure  similar to ones in the United States and some European countries  that would allow the company to avoid conviction in exchange for a substantial financial penalty A criminal conviction would have barred the company from government work  which could potentially have imperiled thousands of Canadian jobs  Mr  Trudeau and his aides have repeatedly denied any impropriety Ms  Philpott also angered her Liberal colleagues by saying in a magazine interview that Ms  Wilson Raybould was being blocked by the government from revealing important information about the case While Mr  Trudeau made the decision to expel the two former members  a movement within the caucus to remove them began escalating over the weekend Wayne Easter  a former cabinet minister and veteran member of Parliament  told the Canadian Press news agency on Monday that recording the call without the knowledge of Michael Wernick  the clerk of the privy council  was  as low as you can go  He added   Jody Wilson Raybould  Should be gone  Gone  Should ve been gone long ago  While neither woman found many allies within their party  they have been celebrated by opposition members of Parliament for their actions In a statement  Andrew Scheer  the leader of the opposition Conservatives  said their expulsion showed that  if you tell the truth  there is no room for you in the Liberal Party  The Conservatives are filibustering debate on Mr  Trudeau s budget legislation in a bid to force a public inquiry into the matter Hours before she was removed from the Liberal caucus  Ms  Wilson Raybould urged her colleagues  in an unapologetic letter  to allow her to remain in the party  Now I know many of you are angry  hurt and frustrated   she wrote   And frankly so am I  I am angry  hurt and frustrated because I feel I was upholding the values that we all committed to  In her statement on Monday evening  Ms  Philpott dismissed the criticisms of several of her former colleagues  I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal  of trying to bring down the prime minister  of being politically motivated  and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson Raybould   Ms  Philpott wrote   These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods  I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister  Nor did Jody Wilson Raybould  The two former cabinet ministers will not be allowed to seek re election under the Liberal Party banner in October s election and are likely to face Liberal opponents in their electoral districts if they choose to run for re election Unless they join one of the opposition parties  they will also not have access to party financial  logistical and polling resources Both were political neophytes during the last election  in 2015  Ms  Philpott is a doctor and Ms  Wilson Raybould a lawyer who was also an Indigenous leader in British Columbia  Neither has a well developed  personal political machine Mr  Trudeau s efforts to turn political attention away from the case have so far faltered On Tuesday  he ended his announcement with a campaign style speech in which  among other things  he highlighted the government s efforts to mitigate climate change and attacked the Conservatives  plan to kill carbon taxes

LONDON   Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday broke with her own party  appealing to the opposition to work with her on a plan in a move that could keep Britain closely tied to the European Union after the country leaves the bloc Mrs  May made the announcement after her cabinet had met for seven hours  amid a growing sense of crisis  With only 10 days left until Britain is due to leave the European Union  she also said she would ask leaders of the bloc for an extension Parliament is deadlocked on the issue  and lawmakers are increasingly alarmed by the prospect of careering out of the bloc without an agreement Her overture to the Labour Party could mark a turning point in Brexit  as Britain s exit from the European Union is known  ending months of stalemate between Mrs  May and Conservative hard liners  who have adamantly refused to support the deal she negotiated with the European Union  This basically rips up the last two and a half years as far as her stance goes   said Tim Bale  professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London  It seems the calculation has changed  and finally the country s interests have been put above those of the Conservative Party   he added Mrs  May s deal with Europe has two parts  a withdrawal agreement  which details the practical terms of the divorce  and a political declaration  which outlines Britain s future relationship with the bloc The prime minister said the withdrawal agreement must stand  even though Parliament has rejected it three times already  European leaders have insisted upon this Under the withdrawal agreement  Britain would remain in the European Union customs and trading system until at least the end of 2020 Negotiations with the Labour Party will center on changes to the political declaration  However  these would be nonbinding and could be dismantled by a future British government Mrs  May s plan had envisioned eventually severing ties with the bloc s customs and trading system  and taking control over immigration from continental Europe Until now  she has refused to consider softening any of these so called red lines The only option Mrs  May will not negotiate with the opposition is canceling Brexit altogether  Closer economic ties with the bloc through a customs union or membership in its single market are up for discussion and even a referendum confirming any deal has not been excluded  Mrs  May s aides said Within an hour of Mrs  May s announcement  pro Brexit Conservatives began to express their dissent  amid reports that a number of cabinet ministers had argued against a further extension Whether the prime minister can win the cooperation of the Labour Party   and whether the European Union will grant her request for another delay   remained unclear  I m very happy to meet the prime minister   said Jeremy Corbyn  the Labour leader  after Mrs  May s announcement  We recognize that she has made a move   he added   I recognize my responsibility to represent the people who supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn t support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future  And that s the basis on which we will meet her and have those discussions  Still  to move forward with this plan  he will have to become involved in the tumultuous negotiation  and share responsibility for the success or failure of Brexit  Some Conservatives expressed dismay that the Labour Party would now be more involved  It is very disappointing that the cabinet has decided to entrust the final handling of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party   said Boris Johnson  who resigned from Mrs  May s cabinet and is considered a front runner to replace her  in an interview with the BBC  I think the result will almost certainly be  if Corbyn gets his way  that we remain in the customs union so that we can t control our trade policy  that there are huge areas of lawmaking we can t control  and Brexit is becoming soft to the point of disintegration   he said It has never been clear whether Mrs  May was willing to lead the country into a no deal exit  a threat she raised repeatedly in tough talking speeches at the start of negotiations A powerful faction in the Conservative Party  to which she has devoted most of her adult life  has shifted to a hard line position  shrugging off warnings of severe economic consequences with a no deal exit  and advocating what they called  a clean break  It was unclear whether Mrs  May had shifted as well  Her remarks on Tuesday  however  suggested that she had not  When it came down to it  she was just too sensible   said Rosa Prince  the author of a biography of Mrs  May   She s got to be thinking of her legacy now  and if people are dying for lack of medicine  if there are food shortages  if Britain goes feral  that s not how she wants to be remembered  Speaking at 10 Downing Street  Mrs  May said it was clear Britain would need an extension to Brexit  but  one that is as short as possible  Mrs  May s immediate plan is to try to reach an agreement with Mr  Corbyn and get Parliament s support for it before next week s European Union summit in Brussels on April 10 Alternatively  she said  Parliament would vote on an array of alternatives  with the government promising to accept the outcome Mrs  May hopes Britain might still be able to leave the bloc next month and avoid holding elections to the European Parliament  Failing that  she would ask for an extension that could be curtailed as soon as Britain had ratified its withdrawal agreement After Tuesday s extraordinary cabinet meeting  ministers were held in Downing Street without access to cellphones until Mrs  May had spoken  a sign she wanted to get her version out before her fractious cabinet started leaking  Chilean wine was served as they waited Upon emerging  cabinet members told journalists that they had discussed the option of calling a general election  but that polling suggested that the Conservative Party might fare poorly if a new election was called now Mrs  May s willingness to adjust her position on Brexit came  too late   said Ayesha Hazarika  a political commentator and former Labour adviser   This should have been done right at the beginning  She added   It shows how catastrophically badly she has handled the chronology of the process  By this stage  Ms  Hazarika said   the politics are too raw on both sides   and Mr  Corbyn will be under intense pressure to call for a second referendum Mr  Corbyn himself is a longtime euroskeptic  but many of his party members are pushing strongly for a second referendum or for canceling Brexit altogether  Labour is also intent on holding a general election in the near future Mr  Corbyn  who has safely criticized the government from the margins  risks being held responsible for an unpopular result if he cooperates with Mrs  May  Ms  Hazarika said  Their strategy has been to have a clean hands Brexit  the Tories will mess it all up   she said   If she s co opting him to be a co pilot  does he want to take that responsibility   He s got a big strategic question to ask   she added She said the next days were likely to bring all kinds of bizarre twists  like collaboration between Mr  Corbyn and Conservative backbenchers in an effort to bring Mrs  May down in a no confidence vote  Anything is possible right now   she said   There are so many wheels within wheels right now  I have never seen anything like it

BRUSSELS   If Britain ever wants an orderly exit from the European Union  it must pass the withdrawal agreement painfully negotiated with the bloc  Michel Barnier  its chief Brexit negotiator  warned on Tuesday Given how little time remains before April 12  when Britain might have to leave the European Union without a deal  Prime Minister Theresa May emerged from a series of tense cabinet meetings to say that she will ask her European counterparts to grant Britain another short extension to try to pass a withdrawal agreement  Parliament has already rejected her plan three times by margins varying from historic to hefty A majority in Parliament opposes a no deal Brexit  but agrees on little else To show the Europeans that the extension is worth providing  Mrs  May announced that she would try to meet with the head of the opposition Labour Party  Jeremy Corbyn   to agree a plan that we would both stick to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal  Mr  Corbyn favors a much closer trading relationship in the future with the European Union than Mrs  May  But if the two leaders can agree on a softer Brexit  then a parliamentary majority might be found to leave the European Union with a deal  initiating a transition period of at least two years while a future relationship is negotiated In his comments on Tuesday morning  Mr  Barnier made it clear that even if Britain asks for a long extension  the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened  and that negotiations on the country s future relationship with the European Union cannot legally take place until Britain is no longer a member Having failed to achieve a breakthrough on Monday  a group of lawmakers working across party lines were on Tuesday planning a new strategy to try to avert the increasing risk of a no deal Brexit What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union If approved in a vote expected to take place Thursday  the measure introduced by a Labour member  Yvette Cooper  would require Mrs  May to request another delay But the proposed legislation  which will mostly likely be discussed on Wednesday  does not specify what the extra time would achieve  so it remains unclear whether such a request would satisfy European Union leaders  They have said that Britain could get another extension only if it has a new strategy  such as holding a general election or second referendum  and if it agrees to take part in the European elections in May The cabinet held two meetings on Tuesday as Mrs  May attempted to find a way out of the crisis  Though she said she wanted to avoid leaving without a deal and noted that Parliament would try to stop it  the prime minister s office also said that a no deal exit was the default scenario if there were no agreement Britain could also leave without an agreement  which Mr  Barnier said is  day after day more likely   He insisted that the European Union was prepared for this scenario But even then  he said  Britain would have to return to talks with Brussels in a badly strained relationship to manage day to day dealings  including air transportation  trade and customs  The bloc could then negotiate a free trade agreement with Britain  as with Japan or Canada  but key issues would  still be on the table   Mr  Barnier said  listing protections for citizens  rights  preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland  and Britain s legal and financial obligations to Brussels It would be much simpler for Parliament  which Monday night could find no majority for the Brexit plan  to pass the legally binding withdrawal agreement  Mr  Barnier said  Then the two sides could immediately begin to negotiate their future relationship  since the nonbinding political declaration  leaves the door open for a variety of outcomes  and could be easily adjusted to Britain s wishes  If the U K  still wants to leave the E U  in an orderly manner  this agreement  this treaty  is and will be the only one   Mr  Barnier said   If there is no deal  there is no transition  ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain in Parliament in London on Monday  Lawmakers have already rejected her withdrawal agreement three times CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Barnier spoke and took questions on Tuesday at the European Policy Center  a think tank based in Brussels The mood in Brussels has been somber as the British Parliament floundered in its attempts either to pass the withdrawal agreement or to find a majority for any alternative  But that agreement  including the so called Irish backstop  will not change  Mr  Barnier and other European leaders have said Some member countries  like France  tend to favor a no deal Brexit so the issue does not affect European parliamentary elections at the end of May The fear is that Brexit will be taken up by Europe s various populist and euroskeptic parties as another sign of the supposed indifference of Brussels to democratic expression But others  like Germany  believe that Britain is a crucial neighbor and partner in trade and defense  and argue that it should be given a longer extension  The heads of state and government are to meet in Brussels in an emergency session on April 10  two days before the current Brexit deadline  to hear what Britain has decided To get an extension  Britain must tell the other member states why it wants one   for a general election  another referendum or some other reason that promises a way out of the impasse rather than just allowing more time for bickering and deadlock But a long extension has political and economic costs for both sides  Mr  Barnier noted  citing uncertainty that is damaging business relationships and investment and the need for the European Union to concentrate on other pressing issues  like migration  economic growth  inequality  refugees and terrorism  The leaders  he said  would have to  balance the different costs  between no deal  even if by accident  and a long prolongation  The European Union will protect its single market no matter what  Mr  Barnier said  since 500 million people and 22 million businesses depend on it   We will never fragilize or unravel the single market   he said in English   If we fragilize or unravel the single market  we are lost

Council Speaker Corey Johnson has said he is considering running for mayor in 2021 CreditDave Sanders for The New York TimesWhen The New York Post s Page Six column reported that Jeff Zucker  CNN s president  was possibly interested in running for New York mayor  some people were skeptical After all  the gossip column called the news  a wild rumor flying around the TV industry  and published it on April Fools  Day Others  like Monica Klein  a political consultant who once worked for Mayor de Blasio  saw it as another reminder that the city has never elected a woman to its top office  In contrast  yesterday Chicago elected Lori Lightfoot as mayor  becoming the largest American city to ever choose a black woman as its top official In New York  Mr  Zucker joined a list of men who have been named as potential 2021 mayoral candidates  City Comptroller Scott Stringer  City Council Speaker Corey Johnson  Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr  and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams  Letitia James  the former city public advocate  was thought to be a promising candidate before she became the state attorney general  The question in New York  isn t so much who could run and win as a woman  but what does the fact that we only have an all male field tell us about the lack of developing female leadership in this city   Ms  Klein said  Why don t we have a bench   she added   It s
